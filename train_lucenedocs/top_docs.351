An 11 year old pilot left Montreal Monday on the next part of his San Diego to Paris journey after his plane was grounded for a day by mechanical trouble. Christopher Lee Marshall left Dorval airport at 2:42 p.m. EDT headed for Wabush, Labrador, in a single engine Mooney 252 two seater, said Doug McGurk, a Transport Canada spokesman. The boy from Oceano, Calif., has said the trip will make him the world's youngest transatlantic pilot and he wants to make the trip to emulate Charles Lindberg's 1927 flight to Paris.

A bit of aviation history was made in this city where Charles Lindbergh learned to fly. Twenty corporate aircraft, half of them the popular Learjets, were put on the auction block Wednesday in a first of its kind event for the aircraft industry. This has never been done before in aviation, save for an occasional bankruptcy sale and sales of smaller or antique planes, said J. Robert Duncan, president of Duncan Aviation.

Police say they may have to use the lastest technology of modern forensics to determine the victim's identity. We have nothing concrete, said Hopewell Township Police Lt. Michael Chipowski.

It's hard to imagine a more picturesque setting for an international airport on a bayfront flanked by rolling hills, glassy skyscrapers and the gray magnificence of a Navy fleet. But to pilots who are forced by downtown buildings to descend steeply on approach to Lindbergh Field, the setting for the airport serving the nation's sixth largest city is all wrong.

When Corrigan landed in Ireland on July 18, 1938, after a flight that was supposed to take him to Long Beach, Calif., he had only $3 in his pocket and knew no one, he said in an interview Sunday before departing from New York. This time, accompanied by his son, Harry, and daughter in law, Charlotte, Corrigan crossed the Atlantic in six hours as an honored guest of Aer Lingus in a Boeing 747. The airline plans three days of ceremonies for him.

Gang violence and drug peddling at a housing project behind a junior high school show no signs of going away, so officials are trying to make the campus bulletproof by building a 10 foot high wall. Faculty and administrators wore T shirts Friday bearing The Great Wall of Lindbergh logo to show their enthusiasm for the $160,000 project at Lindbergh Junior High School. It is scheduled for completion in six weeks.
