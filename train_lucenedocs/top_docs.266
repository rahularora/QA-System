For months beneath the streets of this college town, artist Paul Matisse and his audience have been communing about music, joy and mechanical engineering. It began in October after he installed 16 massive chimes in Cambridge's recently renovated Kendall Square subway station. The piece, called Pythagoras, was broken the day after its unveiling, and despite repairs and redesignings, it has been broken repeatedly since then.

If there is much to take issue with in Beyond Numeracy, there is also much to be amused and enlightened by. The lore has it that when Pythagoras discovered his great theorem on right triangles, he was so transported that he sacrificed 100 head of oxen to the gods as a token of gratitude. On this scale, Mr. Paulos's book is surely worth an ox or two.

THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES: MUSIC SCIENCE AND THE NATURAL ORDER OF THE UNIVERSEby Jamie James Little Brown Pounds 18.99, 260 pages The power of music over mankind, for dancing, fighting, love making, praying or mourning, is one of life's unsolved mysteries. Even cows are said to find it soothing, while Brahms's spider was literally moved charmed down its thread by the composer's harmonies and sent scuttling up again by his dissonances.

But it is also a commonplace that science and music have some affinity (think of all those boffins who play in string quartets), so that when little Emily passes her Grade 5 piano with distinction the neighbours exclaim: 'Oh, she must be good at maths]' Therefore it is somewhat disappointing not to find in this present excursion into the metaphysics of music any account of current scientific thinking about why human beings react as they do when they hear certain tones or rhythms or cadences.

Slimy and icky were the prevailing exclamations after many of the young visitors touched them. They were among 2,000 participants in the sixth annual Herpetological Weekend, sponsored by the Chicago Herpetological Society, at the Chicago Academy of Sciences.

To acquaint your children with the mechanics of a lunar eclipse, it may be helpful to have a flashlight on hand, along with several common spheres, such as a marble, a pingpong ball, a tennis ball or a grapefruit, that you can use to represent the Earth and moon. By placing a marble or pingpong ball on a table, and holding a lighted flashlight near the table's surface, you can create a long shadow that extends from the object and narrows like a cone down to a point. (This shadow is called the umbra, from the Latin word for shadow, which is the root for our word umbrella.

One bright chilly morning, 17 community volunteers gather in the library of Cleveland Avenue Elementary, making preparations for a day of African storytelling and readings of black American poetry. Some wear the colorful native garb of Nigeria, but others sport a more conventional business look. That's more important than middle class people might know, says Eunice Robinson, the principal.

</P> <P> Let's examine what we have: Joe Montana? Well, of course. What more do you need to say?

Well, of course. What more do you need to say? He comes with the Super Bowl.

John Elway? Natch! Here's a guy who has put mediocre teams in Super Bowls.

</P> <P> Bernie Kosar. Look! This may be the really smartest quarterback in the game.
 LA010990-0127 
Look! This may be the really smartest quarterback in the game. He unloads the ball in a kind of ungainly sidearm motion like a guy dropping a suitcase, but let me tell you something, Stan Musial didn't have the best batting form you ever saw.

Among mathematicians, Sir Roger Penrose is a caveman. I do not mean he is some snaggle toothed evolutionary throwback even if certain high priests of brain science would call him that. He is a caveman because he agrees with Plato, who first used the analogy that human beings are like prisoners in a cave who can see only the shadows of reality thrown on to the wall by the firelight.

A mathematical puzzle that has fascinated scientists and researchers for hundreds of years may now be solved, a professor at West Germany's Max Planck Institute said today. The puzzle has been how to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, developed by French mathematician Pierre de Fermat, who lived from 1601 to 1665. The theorem states: X to the Nth power, plus Y to the Nth power, equals Z to the Nth power, where X, Y, and Z are nonzero integers, has no solutions for N when N is an integer or whole number greater than the number two.

This is the topic of the book's second part, where Penrose explores new ways of thinking about the connections between brain cells the synapses the proposal being that they behave in non computational ways describable only by laws intermediate between the quantum and classical levels. There is a great deal of challenging mathematics and science in this book. Penrose's argument against the computational model of mind turns on a particular application of the famous theorem discovered in 1930 by the Czech mathematician Kurt Godel, which proves that no set of rules for proving propositions in some formal system can ever be sufficient to establish all the true propositions of that system.

Women are beginning to count more in American mathematics, according to a University of Massachusetts professor who says they earned nearly a quarter of all the math doctorates in the last school year. It should dispel the notion once and for all that mathematics is a man's game, said Professor Edward Connors, who conducts an annual survey of the doctorates issued in the field for the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of America. The new female doctorates, with median starting salaries of $30,500, even made about $500 a year more than their male classmates, Connors said.

Yesterday's curriculum announcement may have been the final act of a dispute which has convulsed education since 1988. The concept of a national curriculum had broad backing when it was introduced as part of Mr Kenneth Baker's Education Reform Act. Religious and physical education had previously been the only compulsory subjects, and education in England and Wales was felt to be wildly out of step with that of other European Union nations.

The United States is a hands down loser when it comes to mathematics education and needs major reforms, including voluntary national standards, to upgrade math achievement, says a report released Thursday. Three out of four U.S. students leave high school without mastering enough mathematics to cope with either job demands or the expectations of colleges, said the report by the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. The report, Everybody Counts, says piecemeal local efforts to correct the nation's math teaching deficiencies are totally inadequate and calls for forward looking national standards to be adopted by local school systems.

THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THOMAS HOBBES: VOLUMES I AND II edited by Noel Malcolm Oxford University Press Pounds 120, 1008 pages A Chinese saying tells us that 'orchids fear the Taylor bird's song, but chrysanthemums survive autumn's frosts'; which means that early developers fade early whereas late developers go from strength to strength. This is an optimistic saying; there is hope for us all yet. Hobbes was a chrysanthemum.

This is an optimistic saying; there is hope for us all yet. Hobbes was a chrysanthemum. At the age of 46 he fell in love with geometry, and suddenly blossomed into an intellectual giant; despite Parkinson's disease later, and perhaps because he sang to himself every night as a way of keeping fit (he said it cleared his lungs), he lived to the grand age of 92, producing scientific, mathematical and philosophical works which had a profound influence upon the birth of modern times.

This work, together with the scientific and psychological theories he developed in connection with it, made him celebrated throughout continental Europe, but a figure of obloquy in his own country partly because of the virulent anti clericalism of his ideas, which made him seem an atheist, but also because the conclusion of his political theory is an uncomfortable one; namely, that the best form of government is absolute rule by a single sovereign power.

Aldridge said a computer and a laser printer, donated by the Americans, have been installed in the Soviet offices of Kvant so that articles can be transmitted by satellite to the Quantum editorial offices in Washington. Aldridge said President Bush presented the first copy of Quantum to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev when the two met for their shipboard summit in Malta. The first edition carries little advertising, and Aldridge said it will take about three years for the magazine to reach the break even point economically.

But he also shows how Oppenheimer's grandstanding arrogance at a congressional hearing in 1949 humiliated Lewis Strauss, who as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission arranged to have Oppenheimer's office at the institute wiretapped and later had the man's head. Mr. Regis summarizes the Oppenheimer literature in a page or two, ending with the letter supporting Oppenheimer's continuing tenure as institute director, signed by some of the institute's faculty: Einstein, Godel, von Neumann.

Sen. Edward Kennedy turned actor Monday, portraying a Harvard Square train station in an algebra lesson that helped turn a U.S. Senate hearing into a lively variety show for 300 children. The young audience also met 4 foot robot, a Harvard scientist who showed them a telescope that can be made for less than $1 and a fifth grade teacher who borrowed a real dinosaur skull for a make believe trip to the Western desert to study paleontology. The setting was a hearing to take testimony for a Senate bill aimed at boosting education in math, science and technology.

Mathematics and science teaching in the schools of England and Wales are 'not as strong as they should be', says a report published yesterday by Ofsted, the education watchdog. The popularity of science subjects among A level pupils has declined and 'there is no room for complacency over the supply of well qualified young adults for employment in engineering or science related fields', it says. The proportion of those studying for science and mathematics A levels only has fallen from 27.6 per cent in the early 1980s to 16.7 per cent this year.

The proportion of those studying for science and mathematics A levels only has fallen from 27.6 per cent in the early 1980s to 16.7 per cent this year. According to the Joint Mathematical Council this means that the proportion of the age group potentially qualified to study a science subject or engineering at university has fallen 40 per cent over the decade.

Ofsted said teaching of mathematics for children aged seven to 11, and of science for those from 11 to 14, needed to be improved. The narrowness of the three subject A level curriculum in the sixth form meant that most primary teachers did not have mathematics qualifications beyond GCSE, the level normally attained by the age of 16.

KAREN HOPE'S new play opens with such a burst or repetitive swearing that it seems like a throwback to the 1980s. That may be an act of deliberate symbolism, for suddenly a character enters declaring that there are enough words in the English language to make swearing unnecessary. Then the effing more or less stops and we may have entered new ground.
