Baker decided to stop off in Oman mainly to rest before joining President Bush in Poland, the first stop on a four nation European tour. Oman was chosen in part because few Arab nations, if any, are friendlier to the United States.

Noting that Brunei law doesn't bar a bank from lending to its officers or shareholders, a Khoo family associate says no provision was made for long outstanding loans because the family owned the bank and they owned the companies it lent to, and they know they can be repaid. The associate adds: It's like managing your own household account. He and other acquaintances of the family allege that the Khoos and National Bank are victims of a vendetta waged by the Brunei government after the Khoos' once close links to the royal family weakened in recent years for various business and political reasons.

Leaders of Southeast Asia and local royalty welcomed the 15 year old future ruler of this tiny oil rich nation into the adult world Wednesday by sprinkling scented water on his hands. Cannons fired in salute and thousands of Bruneians watched on TV to watch the ritual for Prince Al Muhtadee Billah, the son of Sultan Hassanal Bolkia. Leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, as well as 3,000 other VIPs, including members of the royal family, government dignitaries and foreign diplomats, were invited to the two hour ceremony in the throne hall of the sultan's 1,778 room palace.

Craig Gillen, Mr. Walsh's associate counsel who represented the prosecutor at the court proceedings, was cautious in assessing Mr. Abrams's value to the inquiry. But as a senior Reagan administration official, Mr. Abrams moved in high circles and could shed light on the activities of White House and Central Intelligence Agency officers in connection with the same covert supply network. Duane Clarridge, a Central Intelligence Agency officer who had been closely involved in the anti Sandinista war, has been identified as a target of Mr. Walsh's inquiry.

Non Communist Southeast Asia leaders are disappointed by talks in Paris to end 10 years of war in Cambodia but still hope for a peaceful settlement, Malaysia's prime minister said Thursday. The foreign ministers of 19 countries, who met this week in Paris, set up working committees to help monitor Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia and an ensuing cease fire, deal with sovereignty questions and plan for repatriation of refugees. But talks between Cambodian Premier Hun Sen and leaders of the three party Cambodian resistance alliance led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk reached an impasse July 25 after two days of negotiations.

The fired National Security Council aide was part of the Restricted Interagency Group, or RIG, of which Mr. Abrams was chairman. The assistant secretary played down the importance of the group. But records cited by the committees show that in the first six months of 1986, there were as many as 11 meetings of RIG, or a smaller subgroup, that included Mr. Abrams, Col. North and the head of the Central Intelligence Agency's Central America Task Force.

Mr Mohamed Fayed, the Egyptian born businessman who runs the Harrods department store in Knightsbridge, is an implausible guardian of British public morals.

Before the mid 1980s, when he and his brothers came to public attention because of their bid for the House of Fraser stores group, Mr Fayed had sat on the board of Mr Tiny Rowland's controversial international conglomerate, Lonrho, and acted as a middleman for British contractors in the Gulf.

The Iran Contra panel yesterday received its best testimony so far about how the Contras were kept alive while U.S. aid was suspended. If the members had listened carefully, they would have learned that their micromanaging of Nicaragua policy was at least as big a problem as Ollie North's entrepreneurship. We only hope this bitter lesson will not lead them to assassinate the reputation of witness Elliott Abrams out of spite.
