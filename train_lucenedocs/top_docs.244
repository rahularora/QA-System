Baseball historians were thrown a curve Wednesday with a newspaper report that Alexander Cartwright possibly wasn't the inventor of their game. The New York Times said that a newly discovered newspaper report and box score show that other teams were already playing baseball in New York City a year earlier than when Cartwright supposedly invented the game in 1846. The story also reported that baseball probably evolved from a number of enthusiasts in New York in the mid 1840s, rather than springing fully formed from the imagination of anyone in particular.

As spring comes to the Balkans, Romania is taking its first swing at America's national pastime. The league president is a former national champion swordsman who has never played an inning of baseball. Enough coaches have signed up to form 29 teams around the country, but there are only six proper fields.

The league president is a former national champion swordsman who has never played an inning of baseball. Enough coaches have signed up to form 29 teams around the country, but there are only six proper fields. The amateur players are veterans of oina, the beloved sport of Transylvania that is played on a rectangle instead of a diamond and bears as much resemblance to baseball as Babe Ruth does to Dracula.

His best season was 1934, when, as a Philadelphia Phillie, he hit .330 and tied for the National League lead in doubles with 42. Batting .300 is a bigger thing now than in that hit crazy period, but the Cincinnati native still stood out, for his scholarly bent. At a time when collegians were rare in professional baseball, he earned a bachelor's degree in education from the U. of Cincinnati in 1927, while a Cincinnati Red, and a master's degree from Columbia, in 1932, while a New York Giant.

Mr. Will is nothing if not serious about his favorite sport, and the attitude permeates his book Men at Work: The Craft of Baseball (Macmillan, 353 pages, $19.95). A political commentator by trade, he is a tourist between the foul lines, but an inquisitive and extraordinarily nimble minded one. Moreover, he is adept at summoning testimony from baseball insiders whose vocabulary and methods of analysis may be more familar to the average fan's ear than his own.

The pick of the baseball history books I read was Two Spectacular Seasons (Macmillan, 288 pages, $17.95), by William B. Mead. It's about the 1930 campaign, when the hitters dominated, and the 1968 one, when the pitchers did. Mr. Mead does particularly well with the '30 season, which was a bonanza for baseball oddments as well as base hits.

Yaz (Doubleday, 300 pages, $19.95), by Carl Yastrzemski and Gerald Eskenazi, is a bit of a grind, matching the career of baseball's quintessential grinder.

Philip Bess is an architect and a baseball fan, and he wishes that his professional eye didn't so often interfere with his enjoyment of his favorite sport. Except for golf, no game is as much affected by the shape of the field on which it's played as baseball, which gives us architects a rare opportunity to influence it, he says. Yet I think that with few exceptions, Major League stadiums built since 1960 have made the game duller instead of more interesting.

The modern stadium, Bess contends, is too big, too sterile and too uniform. Though a relatively young man (he's 35 years old), he yearns with a baseball fan's inbred sense of nostalgia for the old days, when parks differed widely in size, shape and terrain.

Mark Twain's Literary Offenses of Fenimore Cooper put Deerslayer, Leatherstocking and Natty's other incarnations out to pasture somewhere on the prairie of forgotten adventure tales.

With such a mind set, it was remarkable that the players would offer the job to a hard core unionist like Mr. Miller. And, given that glimpse into the baseball psyche, it's more remarkable that he took it (without, as it turned out, committing himself to accepting the aid and comfort of Mr. Nixon). Most remarkable, though, was the association's record during the Brooklyn born economist's 17 years as its leader, ending in 1983.

The lords of the baseball were (and still are) exempt from the nation's antitrust laws, never gave the players copies of many of the documents that bound them, and, when they felt changes were in order, simply had their appointed commissioner announce them unilaterally. A player running afoul of the game's powers that be was in the same situation as a stranger arrested in one of those tiny towns where the sheriff also turns out to be the judge and the mayor, Mr. Miller writes. Moreover, as he notes in several contexts, some of the men he represented were ignorant of or hostile to the role of unions in protecting workers' interests, and many were apathetic over issues they perceived as not directly involving them.

Moreover, as he notes in several contexts, some of the men he represented were ignorant of or hostile to the role of unions in protecting workers' interests, and many were apathetic over issues they perceived as not directly involving them. For instance, no player showed up in court to give moral support to Curt Flood in his 1970 legal assault on the reserve clause, or to hear arguments in the owner's (unsuccessful) suit to overturn the five years later arbitrator's ruling that killed the infamous rule and allowed the players to flex their market muscle.

But he goes on to say that years of labor strife in baseball, including the strike of 1972 and the lockout of 1976, paid off in player solidarity during the 50 day, 1981 walkout over the owners' bid for warmbody compensation for lost free agents.
