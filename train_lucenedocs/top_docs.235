Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin led a parade Saturday through Johnson Space Center in the city whose name was the first word ever spoken on the moon two decades ago. On July 20, 1969, men first stepped on the moon and made more than footprints in history, Aldrin told space fans at a rally beside what would have been Apollo 18, the giant Saturn 5 rocket whose mission was scuttled by an expensive war in Vietnam. Aldrin, minus his fellow moon walker of 20 years ago, Neil Armstrong, was one of 14 Apollo astronauts who attended the Saturday morning events commemorating the successful 1969 mission and other past accomplishments and looking ahead to an expanded program of space exploration.

Twenty years after the first moon walk, the Apollo 11 crew called for further exploration of the lunar surface and Mars, but another astronaut said a bold new program is unlikely soon. Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins, at a ceremony Sunday commemorating the anniversary of their spectacular liftoff on July 16, 1969, expressed their hopes for a rejuvenated space program. On Thursday, the anniversary of the landing, they will join with President Bush for a celebration outside the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

The highlight of all those years had to be the moment Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped onto the moon's Sea of Tranquillity on Sunday, July 20, 1969. For eight years, ever since President Kennedy had set this nation on a course to the moon, almost everything launched from Cape Canaveral was a stepping stone to that goal. Mercury proved man could survive in space.

<P> Apollo 11 astronaut Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. led a parade through the Johnson Space Center in Houston, the city whose name was the first word ever spoken on the moon two decades ago. On July 20, 1969, men first stepped on the moon and made more than footprints in history, Aldrin told space fans at a rally beside what would have been Apollo 18, the giant Saturn 5 rocket whose mission was scuttled because of the costs of the war in Vietnam. Aldrin, minus his fellow moon walker of 20 years ago, Neil A. Armstrong, was one of 14 Apollo astronauts who attended the events commemorating the successful 1969 mission and other past accomplishments and looking ahead to an expanded program of space exploration.

The three Apollo 11 astronauts had another splashdown Thursday, this time in the form of a party with thousands of NASA employees celebrating the 20th anniversary of their lunar landing. Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins arrived from Washington, where they had lunch with President Bush. Twenty years ago, I sat in mission control when these guys came down and I wouldn't miss this for the world, said Hans Mark, a former Johnson Space Center director who is now chancellor for the University of Texas.

A bash for 10,000 past and present NASA employees had the same open bar and mob scene as the parties that followed Apollo missions 20 years ago. The only thing missing was the splashdown. Then, they threw everybody in the pool, said Cookie Leisenring, a retired National Aeronautics and Space Administration employee who was trying to take pictures of the honored guests at Thursday's party at the Johnson Space Center Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, who marked the 20th anniversary of the first moonwalk.

<P> The executive producer of a CBS documentary on man's first walk on the moon in 1969 said the program mistakenly showed clips taken on the moon during a 1972 flight. The program said the 1972 footage was of the historic first moon walk by American astronauts. It was an honest mistake, Perry Wolff said Friday of the error in The Moon Above, the Earth Below, a two hour special that aired Thursday and saluted the 20th anniversary of the historic Apollo 11 moon flight.

Soviet TV viewers finally got a chance Thursday to see what the rest of the world saw 20 years ago: the first steps by a man on the moon. State run TV featured a lengthy documentary on the Apollo 11 lunar landing by astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, including interviews with U.S. scientists. On July 20, 1969, Soviet television ignored the historic landing that millions around the world witnessed live, and instead broadcast a musical variety show.

So the National Aeronautics and Space Administration once again is at a crossroads, as it was when the glory days of Apollo ended.

But Kennedy let the launch date stand, and, on May 5, after a three day weather delay, astronaut Alan Shepard rode a slender Redstone rocket and a cramped Mercury capsule 115 miles up and 302 miles down the Atlantic tracking range on a 15 minute suborbital flight.

Later, they triggered the engine again to achieve a more circular path with a low point of 62 miles and high point of 75 miles.
 AP890719-0006 
Sunday, July 20, 1969: Armstrong and Aldrin entered the lunar module Eagle, and after checking its systems, they cast off from Columbia. They fired the craft's engine to start the descent to the moon. As they neared the surface, they had to overcome computer alarms and had to fly around a boulder field with fuel running low.

The time was 4:17.42 p.m. EDT. At 10:56 p.m., Armstrong stepped off a landing leg ladder and planted the first human footprint on the moon. Aldrin followed 18 minutes later, and for about two hours, with more than 500 million people watching on Earth, they explored the surface, planted the American flag, gathered 50 pounds of lunar rocks and soil and spoke with President Nixon through a radio telephone hookup.
 AP890719-0006 
Monday, July 21, 1969: Precisely 69 seconds after Collins and Columbia passed over Tranquillity Base, Armstrong fired Eagle's ascent engine and it rose swiftly off the moon after a stay of 21 hours, 37 minutes. The Eagle is back in orbit, Armstrong radioed. For more than 3 hours, Armstrong and Aldrin flew a series of tricky rendezvous maneuvers, closing in on Columbia.

Eagle, no longer needed, was jettisoned to orbit the moon for several weeks before lunar gravity tugged it down to a crash landing.
 AP890719-0006 
Tuesday, July 22, 1969: Collins fired Columbia's main engine for 2 minutes, 29 seconds to propel the ship out of lunar orbit and start a 60 hour trip back to Earth. We've got you coming home, Mission Control radioed. Within hours, they left the influence of lunar gravity and were firmly in the grip of Earth's gravity, accelerating toward home.
 AP890719-0006 
We've got you coming home, Mission Control radioed. Within hours, they left the influence of lunar gravity and were firmly in the grip of Earth's gravity, accelerating toward home. A short burst of the main engine set them on a precise course to land two days later in the Pacific Ocean southwest of Hawaii, where the recovery carrier USS Hornet waited.
 AP890719-0006 
Wednesday, July 23, 1969: A final television show from Columbia highlighted an otherwise quiet day as Columbia sped closer to Earth and the three astronauts relaxed and monitored spacecraft systems. Armstrong showed viewers two sealed boxes in which were packed precious bits of soil and rock that he and Aldrin had collected on the moon. He explained the samples were placed in containers in the vacuum of the moon and were sealed to prevent possible contamination of the Earth.

Twenty years after Neil A. Armstrong made his giant leap for mankind on the moon, he and his fellow Apollo 11 astronauts said Friday they are disappointed man has not taken even one small step on Mars. I thought the moon would lead immediately and logically to Mars, said Michael Collins, the astronaut who remained in the spacecraft Columbia circling the moon while Armstrong and Edwin Buzz Aldrin set down on the Sea of Tranquility on July 20, 1969. Millions of television viewers watched the heady culmination of a bold challenge issued in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy to land an American on the moon by the end of the decade.

A former chief NASA astronaut says he is disappointed in the progress of the nation's space program, blaming the emphasis on the shuttle for a slowdown in space development and exploration. The reusable orbiters on which NASA staked its future in the early 1970s have never been the workhorses their supporters promised, says John W. Young. I think we were being unrealistic about what our capabilities and limitations were in the old days, said Young, who flew on the first manned Gemini mission in 1965.

I expect there's a lot of astronauts leaving because they see the line at the end of the tunnel the line they've got to stand in to get a flight is so long.

Twenty years after man's first step on the moon, President Bush said Thursday Americans must commit to the permanent settlement of space, first returning to the moon and then embarking on a journey into tomorrow, a manned mission to distant Mars. The president offered no firm timetable or pricetag for a program that could cost hundreds of billions of dollars but said it would be worth the cost because it is humanity's destiny to strive, to seek, to find. And because it is America's destiny to lead.

While America marks the 20th anniversary of man's landing on the moon, NASA has on its wish list a permanent scientific lunar outpost early next century. When astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot in the lunar dust July 20, 1969, some scientists saw it as a logical step toward building a research base there. But no overwhelming public or political support developed for such an expensive undertaking, and blueprints were shelved.

Another leftover Apollo capsule carried three American astronauts to a linkup with two Soviet cosmonauts in 1975. Following that flight, the American manned space program entered a dry spell of six years.

With no public announcement, NASA's director of flight crew operations a year ago issued the first written order prohibiting astronauts in training from taking part in risky recreational activities. High risk recreational activities are defined as those where there exists exposure of major, or even fatal, injury, Donald R. Puddy said in the order. Examples include, but are not limited to: auto, boat, airplane or motorcycle racing; parachute jumping; and snow skiing.

The footprints left in the lunar dust 20 years ago by Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin should be visible for half a million years because the moon has no atmosphere to erode them, says a California chemist. But the absence of an atmosphere also leaves the moon unprotected from meteorite and cosmic ray strikes, and these eventually will erase the footprints, reports James R. Arnold. Arnold, who calls himself a cosmochemist, is director of the California Space Institute at the University of California, San Diego.

<P> Landing on the moon was child's play as astronaut Michael Collins led schoolchildren on a simulated space trip, commemorating the 20th anniversary of man's first steps on the lunar surface. Collins and students from Prince George's County, Md., schools were linked by television satellite to a mock up mission control manned by astronaut Charles Duke and students at the Houston Museum of Natural History in Texas. Duke was the capcom, or capsule communicator, when Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. set foot on the moon July 20, 1969.

For nearly 20 years, space buffs have wondered who composed the words That's one small step for a man which Neil Armstrong said when he stepped on the moon. Now, with the one score anniversary coming up July 20, Armstrong says that not only were those words his own, but that he composed them on the spot. Armstrong, commander of the Apollo 11 moon mission, was reunited with his two crew mates for a news conference Friday to satisfy requests for interviews in connection with celebrations planned across the world to mark the event.

Two of the three Apollo 8 astronauts reminisced Tuesday about their mission around the moon 20 years ago this month a feat they said helped lift the nation out of despair at a trying time in its history. You have to remember the time span of when Apollo 8 went up, which was the end of 1968 ... not a very stellar year here in this country, James Lovell, who served as command module pilot, recalled at the Museum of Science and Industry. The spacecraft's command module is on loan there from the National Air and Space Museum in Washington.

Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Buzz Aldrin Jr. thanked NASA's rocket fuel researchers Thursday night during a celebration marking this month's 20th anniversary of the first manned landing on the moon. We were participants and witness to the birth of a new human era, Armstrong said in brief remarks to several hundred people at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Lewis Research Center, which helped develop rocket fuel for the Apollo 11 flight. Armstrong, commander of the three man Apollo 11 crew, and Aldrin said present and past researchers at the center had been instrumental in helping them accomplish the first manned lunar landing on July 20, 1969.

A laser reflection experiment that scientists compared to using a rifle to hit a moving dime two miles away is the only instrument on the moon from the Apollo program still working, NASA officials said Tuesday. The device, called a laser ranging retro reflector, is used regularly to reflect laser beamss aimed at it from Earth, said officials at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. One was set in the lunar dust in the Sea of Tranquility 20 years ago by astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Buzz Aldrin Jr., the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said.

Twenty years after the United States put men on the moon, the Soviets have admitted they raced to get there first, U.S. scientists say. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology released photographs of a landing craft and a module built but never used to put cosmonauts on the moon and bring them back to Earth. The pictures were taken last month by one of a group of U.S. aeronautics engineers who were shown the equipment while touring the Moscow Aviation Institute.

NASA is laying the groundwork to send the next generation of astronauts beyond the Earth's orbit early in the 21st century, with missions to Mars and a space station on a Martian moon among the possibilities. In a report released Monday, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said the nation must make a modest investment of resources during the 1990s to prepare the nation for a range of opportunities in space. This ability is critical to United States leadership in space, said the report titled, Beyond Earth's Boundaries: Human Exploration of the Solar System in the 21st Century.
