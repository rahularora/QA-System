Baseball players in the top US professional league will down their bats, balls and gloves on August 12 for an indefinite period if negotiations with team owners over pay and other issues do not lead to the signing of a new labour contract. If the strike goes ahead, it will be the first baseball stoppage since 1988, and the eighth in 22 years. It also be especially ill timed, because baseball's popularity this season was beginning to recover from years of decline thanks to outstanding performances by players who were threatening to rewrite the record books.

The strike is maddening. Irrespective of the merits, or otherwise, of the players' actions, there is something ludicrous about millionaire sportsmen striking against multi millionaire owners in an argument over money. As anyone who watches a game or reads the sports pages knows, there is plenty of money in baseball.

Last month, a glorious major league baseball season ended prematurely when a strike by players closed the game down after they failed to agree with the owners on how to divide the sport's billion dollar revenues. Now, a similar dispute over revenue sharing between ice hockey players and the management of the National Hockey League is about to lead to the postponement of this weekend's opening of the 1994 95 season. Barring a last minute reprieve, the season that was supposed to cement ice hockey's position as the fastest growing and most fashionable sport in America will be put on temporary hold.

The 50 day strike that chopped the 1981 season off at the knees was waged over owner insistence on warm body (i.e., active player) compensation for lost free agents, a plan that proved so unsatisfactory that it later was junked. A one day strike the last time around, in 1985, ended in a pact that included an increase in arbitration eligibility to three years' service from two. But none of those things, or the collusion on free agent pay offers for which the owners were adjudged guilty for the 1986 and '87 seasons (a fine of $10.5 million was levied for 1986; testimony about the 1987 damage award and charges regarding 1988 still are being heard), have prevented the average player's salary from climbing to $522,000 this season from $371,000 in '85, and about $50,000 in the pre emancipation 1975 campaign.

On Aug. 31, an arbitrator will hand down a ruling that could eventually tilt the economic balance of power in baseball and other professional team sports. Arbitrator Thomas Roberts will decide whether the owners of the 26 major league baseball teams conspired after the 1985 season to prevent players from marketing their services freely, in violation of the collective bargaining agreement that governs the sport's labor relations. If the players win, it could cost the owners plenty.

There's not much he (Mr. Roberts) can do to compel owners to bid, says Gary Roberts, a Tulane University law professor who specializes in sports labor and antitrust law. If the owners win, it would force a player to stay with his old team on their terms a shorter contract with less money, says Mr. Hendricks, the agent.

Thursday night in Baltimore was fit for the end of the world or the baseball season, whichever matters most. With thunder and lightning offstage, the downpour began gently enough ('English rain,' said the man in the seat behind), but soon assumed biblical proportions. The Baltimore Orioles and the Boston Red Sox struggled into the third inning before the umps called for the tarp and nearly three hours later they called it a night.

Negotiations to resolve the baseball players' strike that cut last season short have broken down, greatly reducing the chances that the sport will start again next spring in anything approximating its current major league form. Owners of the 28 teams, meeting in Chicago late yesterday, were expected to declare an impasse in the talks, a legal device under labour relations law that would enable them unilaterally to impose a cap on player salaries. The players' union is likely to counter with a lawsuit accusing management of failing to bargain in good faith.

The professional basketball players union filed suit against the National Basketball Association in a Newark, N.J., federal court, charging that the league's annual draft of college players, its team salary caps and its provision for first refusal rights on players seeking to switch teams violate antitrust laws. Meanwhile, the impasse in the National Football League's labor talks continued as league owners prepared to resume play Sunday with nonunion players and about 35 others who crossed picket lines.

Negotiations to resolve the baseball players' strike that cut last season short have broken down, greatly reducing the chances that the sport will start again next spring in anything approximating its current major league form. Owners of the 28 teams, meeting in Chicago late yesterday, were expected to declare an impasse in the talks, a legal device under labour relations law that would enable them unilaterally to impose a cap on player salaries. The players' union is likely to counter with a lawsuit accusing management of failing to bargain in good faith.

Sandy Alderson, vice president of baseball operations for the Oakland Athletics, was quoted as saying, If Dick Moss represented Babe Ruth I wouldn't talk to him. Mr. Alderson cites Mr. Moss's unsuccessful grievance on behalf of former outfielder Steve Henderson, in which he accused the team of conspiring to lock the player out of the market. To Mr. Moss, all this is part of the game he loves, haggling for an edge, any edge, with management.

For instance, no player showed up in court to give moral support to Curt Flood in his 1970 legal assault on the reserve clause, or to hear arguments in the owner's (unsuccessful) suit to overturn the five years later arbitrator's ruling that killed the infamous rule and allowed the players to flex their market muscle. But he goes on to say that years of labor strife in baseball, including the strike of 1972 and the lockout of 1976, paid off in player solidarity during the 50 day, 1981 walkout over the owners' bid for warmbody compensation for lost free agents. Given the fact that most players never perform long enough to attain free agency, Mr. Miller calls the '81 strike the most principled he'd been associated with in a 40 plus year labor career.
