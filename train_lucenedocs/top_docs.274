It launched a Pounds 46.9m unsolicited bid for JW Spear, the British company which owns rights to the board game outside North America. Scrabble, which ranks alongside Monopoly as a board game known throughout the world, is produced in more than 20 languages and accounts for about 30 per cent of Spear's Pounds 38.7m turnover.

Chieftain, based in Downsview, Ontario, said it seeks an injunction to prevent Coleco's Coleco (Canada) Ltd. unit from selling Scrabble in Canada, beginning in April. Chieftain has been selling Scrabble in Canada since 1980, and claims that it signed an agreement with Coleco in 1986 that provided for extension of the marketing arrangement beyond April. A spokesman for Coleco said that a letter of intent to extend the original agreement was signed in September 1986, but that the letter was subject to a full agreement, which Coleco says never took place.

JW SPEAR, the maker of Scrabble and other games, yesterday announced profits up by more than 46 per cent to Pounds 3.71m for the year to December 31, compared with Pounds 2.53m. The group switched pension fund managers from Scottish Amicable to Scottish Widows at the beginning of 1992 following 'lacklustre performance', Mr Paul Lipscombe, finance director, said. Last July the routine actuarial revaluation had revealed a further charge to the profit and loss reserve bringing the total to about Pounds 700,000 over the last two years.

Advisers to Scrabble maker J W Spear were last night still searching for a white knight to top the Pounds 47m bid for the company from US toy giant Hasbro. But it looked increasingly unlikely that their efforts would be successful ahead of this morning's deadline when acceptances from Spear family trusts owning 24.9 per cent of the shares become irrevocable. Hasbro already has a 26.7 per cent stake in Spear acquired four years ago.

From the first image in the titles sequence the camera rising from primeval waters to cue jagged letters against a riverswept background Scorsese is determined to go Gothic. Hammer horror cloudscapes lower over Nolte and Lange's handsome mansion; deep focus effects pay homage to Citizen Kane; and fairy tale ghoulishness is invoked in the queasy scene where De Niro, luring Miss Lewis's pubescent teenager to the school basement cum makeshift theatre, plays Big Bad Wolf to her Red Riding Hood with a mock up gingerbread cottage behind him. This duel of innuendo between a shyly ripening girl and a slippery psychopath we have already seen him brutalise a woman and bite a chunk from her cheek has a quietly hypnotic power.

The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the top federal prosecutor of insider trading have endorsed legislation that would make brokerage firms liable when employees violate securities laws.

They said a draft bill offered by Rep. Edward J. Markey, D Mass., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce finance subcommittee, should more carefully spell out when brokerage firms would be subject to fines for the violations of their employees.
