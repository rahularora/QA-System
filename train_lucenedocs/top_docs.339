Tracey Ferrell, the project administrator at Vanderbilt, said she talked briefly with Demarest on Tuesday and was told that the researchers found the skeleton amid elaborately decorated pottery and knife blades made of obsidian glass. ; It's definitely a ruler of some kind, Ferrell said. Obsidian was an elite material in the Mayan world because it had to be brought from far away.

A jungle shrouded city of pyramids and temples in Guatemala was built as long ago as 630 B.C., showing that Mayan civilization blossomed about four centuries earlier than believed, scientists say.

Deep in a mangrove swamp near the Gulf of Mexico, archaeologists have discovered traces of what could be another ancient Mexican civilization.

The figure wears ear stops, a tall headdress adorned with four representations of something like a rain god, trimmed with eight feathers, and a breastplate full of other allegorical figures over what appears to be a pleated cotton shirt or tunic. A total of 577 glyphs, or picture words, divided into 21 neat rows running from top to bottom, plus 33 elements like the rain god representations, cover the rest of the slab.

Deep in a mangrove swamp near the Gulf of Mexico, archaeologists have discovered traces of what could be another ancient Mexican civilization. So far, the only clues to these mysterious people are a four ton stele, or stone slab, covered with hieroglyphic writing and a 19 inch high clay figure of a fertility rite priest. But, says Fernando Winfield Capitaine, director of the Xalapa Museum of Anthropology, the finds are so promising that the museum is planning to mount an expedition to that area of Veracruz state in cooperation with the National Geographic Society.

THE quincentenary of Columbus's landfall in America has been the source of considerable soul searching in the US. While mainstream Mr and Ms America may be happy to celebrate Europe's Transatlantic leap, the original new worlders (not to mention the watchdogs of political correctness) are demanding apologies and penance for the devastation which the 'white gods' from the east wrought on the indigeous peoples they encountered. There is then a timeliness in The Art of Ancient Mexico, a fascinating and worthy celebration of the arts of the Olmecs, Mayas, Aztecs and other cultures which dominated Mesoamerica for some 3,000 years before the arrival of the Spanish.

It has been over 20 years since the last major exhibition of ancient Mexican art in London, and an innocent eye is in this case not a bad way to confront cultures at once so alien and yet visually accessible. By eliciting reactions we normally expect only from modern western art, Precolumbian art stoutly refuses to be approached in a narrowly archaeological or even historical mindset. A palma of Brancusi like simplicity and elegance demands to be admired as pure form, despite its presumed religious or practical function.

An archaeological team from the University of Colorado excavating an ancient Indian village in El Salvador has discovered what specialists think are the oldest known remains of a Mayan manuscript. The fragmented remains of what appears to be a codex, pre Columbian written records, were found on an adobe shelf in a house buried by a volcanic eruption 1,400 years ago. Only three other Mayan codices are known to have survived the destruction of the Spanish conquest.

In the last decade, Catholic missionaries have worked hard to help the Indians combine elements of their traditional religion with Catholic teaching to convert the Mayans, who make up nearly half of the country's 9 million people. ; Religion is just one of the forces working to change the Indians in Guatemala, one of the largest indigenous populations in all of Latin America. ; Political turmoil and violence have plagued Guatemala since the mid 1950s and Indians have often been caught between warring factions fighting for control of territory and the population.

The museum, which has one of the finest Egyptology collections outside Cairo, can well afford to return the Theban mud paintings, but Shestack wonders out loud what he and other museum directors might do if faced with the loss of a piece worth maybe millions.

There are yerberos, or experts in medicinal herbs; parteras, or midwives and pediatricians; pulsadores, who diagnose by reading the pulse, and hueseros, who set bones and act as the rough equivalent of chiropracters. Most exalted are the curanderos, also called shamans or rezadores de los cerros: those who know how to speak to the gods.

Prehistoric American civilizations were not built by transplanted Egyptians or wandering ancient astronauts, says archaeologist Wilburn Sonny Cockrell of Florida State University. The origin of the mound builders of North America and the pyramid and city dwellers of Central and South America is explored on The Search for Ancient Americans on public television Wednesday night. A number of people, particularly in this century, have come to an almost racist view of the American Indians, said Cockrell.

Because of the daily rains, archaeological work has been temporarily suspended, but the site remains protected by guards. Besides the burial mound, archaeologists have uncovered a canal and dam wall, perhaps the earliest use of irrigation in the New World, and a four foot tall stone head of an obese, turbaned man. The findings confirm theories that the Olmecs, once thought to have settled only along the Gulf Coast, were well ensconced in the state of Guerrero, closer to the Pacific.

During the next several years, Dunning will place thousands of pinches of dirt on filter paper, add reagents and, within minutes, determine the dirt's relative quantity of phosphates. The simple test reveals soil use: organic refuse such as garbage, human feces or mulch mineralizes quickly, leaving identifiable phosphate fingerprints of hidden dwellings, kitchen gardens and ancient fields. </P> <P> Dunning will drive tubes into lake bottoms to extract core samples layered with centuries of pollen that drained from the forest and from whatever crops that were cultivated.

And yet, as Perez points out in his essay in the catalogue for the show, the boy also represents young Mayan boys who once were sacrificed to quench the thirst of their gods. To make the connection between life and death, sacrifice and nourishment, the artist always pairs this work with a bloody image titled Striking worker, assassinated, from 1934; in the latter a teen age boy lies dead in the street, a victim and martyr whose face is stained by a fountain of blood that flows from his wounds. There is a parallel between the flow of the water and the flow of the blood.

WERE the first civilised discoverers of America Chinese mariners, ordered by their emperor to cross the Pacific on bamboo rafts more than 2,000 years ago? This question, which has puzzled archaeologists and anthropologists for decades, is to be put to a daring test by Tim Severin, the explorer and travel writer. In May, he plans to sail eastwards on a flimsy raft similar to that used by those Chinese sailors to show that they could have completed the 6,000 mile voyage to America.

Severin believes they may have succeeded although they never returned. Severin, aged 52, is no novice to such expeditions. His Brendan Voyage in a leather hulled boat across the Atlantic in 1976, tracing the probable course of an eighth century Irish monk, was followed by further voyages in replica ancient boats; first in the Black Sea to trace the journey of Jason and the Argonauts, in the Mediterranean following Ulysses' 'Odyssey', in the China Sea after Sinbad the sailor, as well as two horseback treks one following a Crusade route and another through Mongolia on the trail of Genghis Khan.

It showed how different have been the experiences of two groups of Saddam Hussein's opponents, the Kurds and the Shia of southern Iraq. The luck of the Kurds began to turn when the cameras focused on the poison gas victims in the streets of Halabja.
