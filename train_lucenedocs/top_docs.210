In third place was Martin Buser of Big Lake, who pulled into Cripple at 2:50 p.m.

Joe Redington couldn't run in the first Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in 1973 because he was too busy organizing the 1,100 mile marathon from Anchorage to Nome. He missed out again in 1983 when a run in with an angry moose during training left him with a few cracked ribs. But Redington, now 70, has run in every other Iditarod, a torturous test of people and dogs billed as The Last Great Race.
