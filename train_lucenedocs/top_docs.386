A couple whose daughter died after years of diet pill abuse asked a congressional panel Monday to push for restrictions on non prescription weight loss drugs. She might have had a chance had these products been denied her as a child, said Anthony and Diana Smith, of State Center, Iowa. Noelle Smith, 20, died a year ago of cardiac arrest after struggling since she was 14 with the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, which is an avoidance of food, and bulimia, which involves binging and purging.

A study suggests the nutritional needs of women with eating disorders differ from those of normal women. A study by Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic found that women recovering from bulimia needed only 73 percent of the normal intake of calories. Conversely, women recovering from anorexia needed two thirds more calories than normal.

Children, like adults, may be keenly conscious of their waistlines and many have tried dieting, a hospital survey suggests. Nearly half of 318 elementary school children surveyed worried they were overweight, and more than a third said they had attempted diets, according to a study released Monday. This study tells us that it's not just the 15 , 20 or 40 year olds who feel they're overweight 9 and 10 year olds feel the same way, said Dr. Michael J.

Some binge eaters produce unusually small amounts of a hormone that ordinarily signals people that they are full, according to a study. The report suggests that a defect in production of this natural chemical may be an underlying cause of bulimia nervosa, an eating disorder in which people stuff themselves with food and then make themselves vomit. Other studies have shown that anti depression medicine is an effective way to curb binge eating, and the latest research shows that the drugs also seem to increase levels of the appetite hormone after a meal.

Abnormally low amounts of a hormone that controls appetite may play a role in bulimia, the cycles of binge eating and purging suffered by some young women, a study published today concludes. The preliminary report found that some people with the disorder make unusually small amounts of cholecystokinin, a hormone produced by the intestines that makes people feel full, or sated, after a meal. We conclude that patients with bulimia do not have normal satiety and have impaired secretion of cholecystokinin in response to a meal, the researchers wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine.

; Wolf puts forward a set of disturbing, some by now all too familiar, statistics on the ravages of this modern beauty fixation: the reports that as many as one in five college women are anorexic or bulimic; the studies that show breast implants have blocked the detection of cancer and so facilitated its spread; the findings that liquid fast diets have led to 60 deaths and that liposuction operations have caused at least 14.

The new director of the Miss America Pageant says there will be so many changes in Saturday's production that he fears raised eyebrows among fans of the 67 year old tradition. But before anyone gasps, Leonard Horn is quick to point out that the swimsuit competition is still in place even though he believes there may be other means of proving a young woman's fitness. The winner still will take her stroll down the runway, a much longer runway this time, to the tune of There She Is.

An experimental drug that erodes a pig's natural defense against pigging out may be the key to producing leaner pork, a U.S. Department of Agriculture scientist says. Ordinarily, pigs know when they are full and don't really pig out, said Jerome C. Pekas, an animal physiologist at the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center in Clay Center. Pigs' aversion to stuffing their snouts is due to a naturally produced hormone that tells them when to lay off the feed, he said Wednesday in a telephone interview from Las Vegas, Nev., where he was attending the 72nd annual meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.

Between 12 and 22 percent of America's children as many as 14 million of those under age 18 are suffering from some type of mental disorder, but only about a third are receiving any treatment, a study released today reported. A committee of the Institute of Medicine said in the study that though millions of childhood mental disorders are not treated, the situation has improved in the last 20 years and there is demonstrable progress toward understanding, preventing and correcting many of the mental diseases of youngsters. There is increasing reason for optimism that many of the major childhood mental disorders are responsive to treatment, the committee said.

This season may mark the end of the era of super long, big event miniseries which actually seemed to end with Amerika, but ABC has had a long term commitment to Herman Wouk's War and Remembrance, the 30 hour sequel to The Winds of War. Eighteen hours of the miniseries will air in November. ABC's Roots: Kunta Kinte's Gift reunites LeVar Burton (Kunta Kinte) and Louis Gossett Jr. (Fiddler) in a question for freedom that will air around Christmas.

The director, Michael Lehmann, and one of the screenwriters, Daniel Waters, made their mark with Heathers, a subversive little comedy about teen age suicide. Their hands are most evident in the movie's wacky segments especially the histrionics of Darwin and Minerva Mayflower, the scheming capitalist couple who amuse themselves with sadomasochistic sex and planning their bear play in the gold market. These caricatures, played by Sandra Bernhard and Richard E. Grant, seem like outtakes from a Monty Python movie or a Michael Lehmann movie.

The whole point is that pageants hurt all women, Miss Anderson said outside the Civic Center. They hurt women who are on the inside because they are bruised psychologically and physically by what they must endure to become queens. Pageants hurt women on the outside because (the contestants) are an icon that we must all look up to and that we're all supposed to emulate, but that makes us unhealthy and promotes anorexia and bulimia and cosmetic surgery.
