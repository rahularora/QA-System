The number of inmates in U.S. prisons jumped by a record 7.3 percent during the first half of 1989 to a total of 673,565 inmates, the Bureau of Justice Statistics says. The six month increase of 46,004 inmates was higher than any full year increase recorded during the 64 years that the government has counted prisoners, the bureau said Sunday. The largest annual increase ever recorded was in 1981 82, when the national prison population grew by 41,060 inmates, from 344,283 to 385,343, said Tom Hester of the bureau.

RULE ONE in the lottery business: The bigger the jackpot, the more tickets you sell. So if you're running a state lottery that offers relatively small cash awards, and you know that hundreds perhaps thousands of your potential customers are playing the multimillion dollar lottery in the big state next door, your strategy is pretty clear: Double, triple or quadruple your own grand prize, and keep those ticket sales at home. That's exactly what Iowa and Missouri, whose citizens are regular players in the wealthy lottery in neighboring Illinois, hope to do.

Philip Morgan determine that from 1980 to 1987 white women under 30 years old continued an earlier trend toward postponing their first birth, while white women over 30 began showing slightly higher rates of first births than over 30 women of earlier decades, clearly seeking to catch up on postponed fertility. Nonwhite women blacks, Asians and others also tended to have their first children at somewhat later ages than nonwhite women in earlier years.

For example, in 1987 a 20 year old nonwhite woman was almost twice as likely to have her first child in the following year as was a 20 year old white woman, while a 25 year old nonwhite woman was about 1 1/2 times more likely to be having her first child than her white counterpart.

The high court upheld a Missouri law that denies unemployment benefits to all employees who leave work for reasons that aren't caused by the job itself.

As President Reagan follows Vice President George Bush into Missouri, he is taking his campaign for the Republican ticket to a state he carried narrowly in 1980 and resoundingly four years ago. Reagan was flying today to Cape Girardeau, a shipping center on the Mississippi River, for a rally at Southeast Missouri State University, and then on to St. Louis to address 1,000 guests at a $250 a plate fund raising dinner. The general thrust of both of these speeches is support for the Republican ticket, acknowledgement of the economic successes of this administration, discussion of the differences between liberals and conservatives, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday.

An increase in drug related arrests and stricter sentencing requirements have brought about a 7.4 percent hike in the number of inmates in federal and state prisons, but prison capacity hasn't kept up, according to the Justice Department. At the end of 1988, a record 627,402 men and women were incarcerated nationwide, but the most optimistic estimate of prison capacity said there was room for 566,898. While the prison population was increasing by 7.4 percent, the prison capacity was increasing by just 5.5 percent.

The addition of 3.8 million people to the preliminary total released this summer reflects 2.9 million residents the bureau missed the first time as well as the anticipated 922,819 military and other federal employees and dependents overseas. Under the Constitution, the new headcount will result in a shift of 19 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. California is the big winner, adding seven seats to give it 52 representatives, or nearly 12% of all the seats in the 435 member House.

The Missourian wants the Energy Department to halt the waste shipments until the Transportation Department can study the rail route used by the Energy Department to move the materials to the laboratory in Idaho Falls, Idaho. Since the shipments began in 1986, Missouri officials have complained that the government's route takes the radioactive materials through densely populated cities such as St. Louis.

The Pentagon costs most congressional districts more in taxes than they get back through military spending but the situation likely will change in the 1990s because of changing budget priorities, says an economist who studies the effects of federal spending. These numbers should look quite different five or six years from now, James R. Anderson said Thursday in releasing a study that showed 321 of the 435 congressional districts lost money on the deal. The patterns are fairly stable over a long period of time, but I think we are going to see some very significant changes as we go into the '90's, in part because of base closings but also in part as we level off and perhaps significantly reduce the military budget, said Anderson, a professor of economics at Michigan State Uniersity.

The latest initiative to revitalize progress against infant mortality was unveiled last year by the Bush administration. Known as the Healthy Start Program, it proposes to halve infant mortality over the next five years in selected localities by wrapping pregnant women and babies in a blanket of care fashioned from the coordination of federal, state, local, and private programs. Unfortunately, there is little reason to suppose that this latest effort will be any more successful than its predecessors.

As experts assessed the ecological damage to the Pacific Northwest, Shell Oil Co. estimated Thursday that a ruptured pipeline in Missouri spilled 840,000 gallons of oil Dec. 24 near a tributary of the Missouri River in one of the biggest inland spills in U.S. history. Shell has recovered about 441,000 gallons, company spokesman Tony Canino said.

George Bush moved toward uncontested nomination at the Republican National Convention, promising that he and newly minted running mate Dan Quayle would work like a couple of pit bulls to whip the Democrats this fall. Campaign officials waited backstage for their cue to release 50,000 balloons from the Superdome ceiling in celebration. Bush Quayle buttons sprouted on the lapels of delegates while the vice president pronounced his 41 year old political partner one of the rising young stars of the GOP.

Quayle, soon to be the Republican vice presidential nominee, began to tell his story to the nation's voters, but he was immediately bombarded with questions about his wealth, his military record and his private life. At the first news conference with running mate George Bush, Quayle denied suggestions he had a sexual relationship with Washington lobbyist Paula Parkinson in 1980: There's nothing to it.

Some delegates believe Bush must sharpen his image to succeed, with the advice ranging from declaring his independence from President Reagan to using fewer hand gestures, wearing horn rimmed glasses and standing straight. Others prefer that Bush ignore the suggestions and be himself.

Bush strategists portray the selection of Quayle as his running mate as a bold bid for the nation's younger generation, but analysts warn that as a voting bloc, the baby boom could prove a bust.

Half of America's 43 million school age children have never experienced tooth decay, a dental problem that affected almost all of America's youth just a generation ago, according to a federal study released Tuesday. In a study that included the oral examination of about 40,000 youngsters coast to coast, the National Institute of Dental Research found that dental cavities have declined by 36 percent among children ages 5 to 17, and that 49.9 percent of these children had no tooth decay at all. Officials said the sample population examined was selected to represent the approximately 43 million school aged children in the nation.

Americans are older, live in different places, have a larger ethnic component and have changed socially and economically in the last decade.

The 1990 census will find not only a bigger population than in 1980, but one that is different in many ways. Americans are older, live in different places, have a larger ethnic component and have changed socially and economically in the last decade. Anticipating what the April count will find, here's a look at the Census Bureau's most recent estimates:
 AP900227-0210 
The U.S. population was estimated at 249.6 million as of Jan. 1 and should be close to 250 million by April 1, up from 226.5 million in 1980. The first census, in 1790, counted 3.9 million people. That's just slightly more than now live in the Dallas Fort Worth area.

Hispanics now make a big dent in America's consciousness, having increased to more than 20 million people as they flooded into the country in recent years. Hispanics now account for 8.4 percent of the population, up from 6.4 percent in the 1980 census. That means Hispanics are growing faster than the general population.
 AP900227-0210 
Hispanics now account for 8.4 percent of the population, up from 6.4 percent in the 1980 census. That means Hispanics are growing faster than the general population. Immigration accounted for about half of the overall gain, said Carmen DeNavas of the Census Bureau.

Since 1982 the Central and South American population here has grown 67 percent. The location and characteristics of immigrants will be of interest this time, Butz said. In 1980 the bureau was surprised at the lack of education among Haitian immigrants, for example, and it located some unexpected pockets of new arrivals.

In 1980 the bureau was surprised at the lack of education among Haitian immigrants, for example, and it located some unexpected pockets of new arrivals. The nation's racial breakdown also is changing. In 1980, 85.9 percent of Americans were white, 11.7 percent were black and 2.3 percent were Asian or members of other races.

The nation's racial breakdown also is changing. In 1980, 85.9 percent of Americans were white, 11.7 percent were black and 2.3 percent were Asian or members of other races. Estimates for 1990 anticipate the white share will be down to 84.2 percent, with blacks up to 12.4 percent and Asians and others rising to 3.4 percent.

Estimates for 1990 anticipate the white share will be down to 84.2 percent, with blacks up to 12.4 percent and Asians and others rising to 3.4 percent. The 1980s appear to be the first decade in at least 100 years when more blacks moved to the South than left it, and the census hopes to learn more about that trend, Butz said.

Getting an accurate county of minorities is an important effort this time, since studies of the 1980 census concluded blacks were missed more often than whites.

Families including a married couple account for just 56 percent of all households, down from 61 percent in 1980 and 70 percent in 1970, reflecting the growth in single people and one parent families. Family size also has been declining as people have fewer children. In 1980 there were 79 youths aged 18 and under for every 100 families.

In 1980 there were 79 youths aged 18 and under for every 100 families. By 1989 that was down to 69. The 1990 count may find the decline in childbearing is easing, however, as women who put off having families to complete schooling and start careers decide to have children.

The 1990 count may find the decline in childbearing is easing, however, as women who put off having families to complete schooling and start careers decide to have children. We are seeing significant changes in the number of women in their 30s having children. Women are postponing their first births and opting for more education and more time in the labor force, says Amara Bachu, a Census Bureau statistician.

The growth of single parent families stemming from divorce also has allowed for more remarriages. Hence, the number of stepchildren grew to 6.8 million by 1985, up 15 percent from 1980. It it expected to prove even higher in 1990.

Hence, the number of stepchildren grew to 6.8 million by 1985, up 15 percent from 1980. It it expected to prove even higher in 1990. Historically there have been far fewer children in one parent homes, with more of those children in homes headed by a widowed, rather than divorced, parent, says Arlene Saluter of the Census Bureau.
 AP900227-0210 
Wives' earnings were increasing at twice the rate of husbands' in the 1980s. But wives still earn half of what their husbands bring home. From 1980 to 1987, wives' earnings rose 23 percent, compared to a 12 percent growth for their husbands.

The nation continues to age as the giant post World War II baby boom generation matures. The median age of the United States hit 30 in 1980, grew to 32.1 by 1987 and will be even higher when the 1990 count is complete. Median means that half of all Americans are older than that age and half younger.
 AP900227-0210 
Americans are better educated than ever before, thanks largely to the educational efforts of the baby boom generation. The 1990 census is expected to show 77.7 percent of men and 76.9 percent of women aged 25 and over have completed high school and 21.9 percent of men and 15.6 percent of women are college graduates, American Demographics magazine says. By contrast, in 1980, 67.7 percent of men were high school grads and 20.3 percent had finished college.

Hispanic and black women, women with low incomes, those living with someone they are not married to, and those in school are statistically more likely to undergo abortions than women in general, according to a private survey. Firm statistics are not available on the number of abortions performed each year nor on who has them. Moreover, the survey by The Alan Guttmacher Institute confirms that most abortions are performed on white, middle class women because they make up the bulk of the population of women of childbearing age.

They ought to win most in Mr Bush's case all the 11 Democratic primaries and caucuses and eight Republican primaries that mark the heaviest day yet in election year, now known universally as Super Tuesday.

Snowy owls, a solitary species of beautiful birds from frozen tundra far to the north, are returning to their winter home near one of the nation's noisiest airports and one of its most polluted harbors. The unusual gathering seems largely due to reminders of home and an abundant food supply at the 1,800 acres of open field at Logan International Airport, said Bradford Blodget, of the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. Massachusetts is probably one of the best places in the entire country to see snowy owls, Blodget said.
