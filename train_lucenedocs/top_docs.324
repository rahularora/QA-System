First Capital won't resist California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's plan to issue cease and desist orders barring the unit, First Capital Life Insurance Co., from honoring policyholders' redemption requests and from selling new policies, those familiar with the situation said. The expected orders would halt an apparently increasing demand for policy redemptions that strip the company of its cash and can compel the sale of assets at fire sale prices. The bar on new business is widely seen as a formality, since few new policies are being sold these days.

I have to wonder whether there's something that I just don't know here and which the public hasn't been told, said Ray Dirks, an analyst at Baird, Patrick &amp; Co., who has in the past recommended the stock of First Capital Holdings.

As recently as last Thursday, people familiar with Citibank sought to minimize First Capital's troubles and said the company wasn't delinquent in its obligations under the loan agreement. The petition for involuntary bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code was filed by Citibank, a unit of New York based Citicorp, as agent for a $275 million syndicated credit agreement. The filing in federal court in Los Angeles asserted that $120 million is due and outstanding under a term loan and that about $11.6 million is due as reimbursements of payouts under a letter of credit.

MR JOHN Garamendi, the rec ently appointed Californian insurance commissioner, yesterday issued a 'cease and desist' order against First Capital Life Insurance Company, a San Diego based insurer whose parent company is 28 per cent owned by Shearson Lehman Brothers. The order prohibits First Capital from making payments to its parent company, First Capital Holdings, or to its affiliates without the Commissioner's permission, and from writing new business. It also places a moratorium on surrenders by First Capital policyholders and on life insurance policy loans.

The commissioner made his remarks while in Washington to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee about another troubled Los Angeles insurer, First Executive Corp., which like First Capital has been crippled by large investments in high risk, high yield junk bonds. Mr. Garamendi seized First Executive's largest insurance unit last month, the biggest failure yet of a U.S. insurer.

SHEARSON Lehman Brothers, the investment banking subsidiary of American Express, is to take a Dollars 144m pre tax charge against second quarter earnings because of a clampdown last Friday by California's insurance regulators on a troubled life company in which Shearson holds a large stake. Analysts expect the write down to push Shearson into the red, despite the markets boom which has been boosting Wall Street profits this year. The brokerage made Dollars 51m in the first quarter.

A victory by the bond claimants would sharply reduce recoveries for large insurance policies and pose greater demands on state insurance guaranty funds, as limited assets would be used to cover a further $1.85 billion in liabilities that barely enter into current workout proposals. Los Angeles based Executive Life is the one time principal insurance unit of First Executive Corp., which itself is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy law proceedings. Analysts say that a bondholders' victory also could more than double the value of the bonds themselves.

Lawyers for the bond underwriters assert that the funding agreements are in principal the same as various company issued annuities. If the court is to set aside the muni GICs, these lawyers argue, then it must set aside nearly $5 billion of other claims, including annuities bought by corporate pension funds and used to provide for victims in personal injury cases.
