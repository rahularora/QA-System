Babe Ruth wasn't just a legendary home run hitter for the New York Yankees he's a registered federal trademark, his two daughters have charged in a suit against MacMillan Publishing. The suit filed Friday in U.S. District Court by Dorothy Ruth Pirone of Durham, Conn., and Julia Ruth Stevens of Conway, N.H., seeks to halt sales of a 1988 calendar published by MacMillan that carries a picture of the late slugger on its cover. MacMillan's unauthorized, unlicensed and unapproved use of Babe Ruth's image, likeness and name tends to cause confusion and deceive the public, said attorney Martin A. Levitin, representing the Ruth family, in court papers.

In BillyBall (Doubleday, 276 pages, $16.95), Mr. Martin, with the help of New York Daily News sport columnist Phil Pepe, relates what he's done since the publication of his autobiography, Number 1, seven years ago.

I'm kind of putting myself on the chopping block by doing this, admits the 26 year old actress, who's playing 20ish Norma Jean Baker (Monroe) in the movie detailing the relationship between the screen icon and writer Bob Slatzer who claims to have been Monroe's second husband. I hope the movie's taken for what it is, a beautiful love story whether or not they believe Bob's account, says Griffiths (who does). No matter how Marilyn &amp; Me is received, she doesn't plan to continue playing Monroe after it airs.

McCuddy's Tavern was built 79 years ago, just in time to cool the throats of construction workers who were building a baseball palace for Charles Comiskey's Chicago White Sox. On Monday, the scene was reversed: The bar was destroyed to make room for a new ballpark. It was a tearful occasion for Jack Blachley, 12, who once sold hot dogs at McCuddy's, a baseball landmark and one of Babe Ruth's favorite hangouts when he came to play the White Sox.
