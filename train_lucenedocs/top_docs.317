The Internal Revenue Service notified Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands that interest on $380 million of municipal bonds issued by the two Pacific jurisdictions isn't tax exempt. But the IRS made it clear it hasn't reached the point of moving to tax interest income earned by bondholders. The Territory of Guam sold $300 million of bonds as tax exempt securities in October 1985.

A December 1987 indictment charged Goldberg with preparing phony invoices that were sent to the bank entrusted with the fund money.

The governments of the Pacific islands of Guam and Saipan filed separate damage suits against Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc. alleging fraud and breach of contract in the New York bond firm's underwriting of huge bond issues there. The suits, among a growing number of civil complaints against the Wall Street concern, seek $350 million in punitive damages and ask for a return of about $20 million in underwriting fees collected by Matthews &amp; Wright. Filed in district courts of the U.S. territories, the suits also seek additional damages for injuries suffered to both islands' economies, said Donald C. Williams, an attorney representing the islands.

Mr. Strauss, according to the documents, pleaded guilty to concealing knowledge of cognizable felonies allegedly committed by Arthur Abba Goldberg, Matthews &amp; Wright's executive vice president, and Frederick Mann, a Canadian who served as a Matthews &amp; Wright consultant. In exchange for Mr. Strauss's plea and cooperation, federal authorities pledged not to seek additional criminal charges against him unless he provides deliberately false or misleading testimony, Mr. O'Connor, the federal attorney, said. Mr. Strauss, a partner in the firm of Berkman Ruslander Pohl Lieber &amp; Engel, was said to be traveling and couldn't be reached for comment.

A federal grand jury on Guam returned a 52 count indictment against Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc.'s executive vice president Arthur Abba Goldberg and company consultant Frederick L. Mann, alleging bribery, fraud and obstruction of justice. Most of the charges stem from the roles of Messrs. Goldberg and Mann in the company's handling of a $300 million Guam housing bond issue in 1985, William O'Connor, Guam's U.S. attorney, said. Some of the counts also relate to their handling of an $80 million housing issue for Guam's neighboring island, Saipan, and a $400 million issue for the Pacific island of Palau, Mr. O'Connor added.

The Idaho bill would ban abortion except in cases of non statutory rape reported within seven days, incest if the victim is younger than 18, severe fetal deformity or threat to the mother's life or physical health. It would ban more than 90 percent of the 1,500 abortions performed in Idaho annually. Idaho was one of the first states to give women their rights, and now they want to take them away from us, said 15 year old Michele May, one of those protesting at the governor's office in Boise.

Federal authorities are now investigating allegations that Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc.'s municipal bond subsidiary systematically made hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal payments to certain public officials to influence them to approve a number of questionable bond issues. The authorities also are investigating the allegedly fraudulent inflating of Matthews &amp; Wright's stock because of its earnings from fees generated in the bond issues, which the company underwrote. Officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and various U.S. attorney's offices said they are probing complaints by businessmen in the various locations that the municipal bond unit bribed officials to help win approval of the bond issues, which already are being studied by federal regulators for their tax exempt status.

The waiver of Japanese reparations, granted early in the Korean War, was a policy decision of the United States to conclude a quick treaty with Japan ... to turn Japan into a valuable Asian ally and a bulwark against communist expansion, Ada said. Ada appeared last month at a hearing on Guam war reparations legislation introduced by Ben Blaz, Guam's non voting delegate in the House of Representatives. The measure faces more hearings and a possible committee vote later this year.

Japanese still invade Guam, but this time as tourists boosting the island's main civilian industry, accounting for most of the 500,000 annual visitors to Guam's beaches. Blaz and Ada say the new payments are justified in light of $67 million paid in Micronesian war claims and the $20,000 authorized by Congress for each Japanese American interned during World War II.

Guam senator Eddie Duenas said: Apparently, many who were eligible failed to file mostly because they did not know about it or were too preoccupied rebuilding their shattered lives.
