A new generation of skyscrapers is about to alter the skyline of Atlanta, previously dismissed as sterile and nondescript. Even homegrown architect John Portman, whose glass towers and soaring atriums for years defined Atlanta and who in the past criticized post modern architecture as a step backward, has given a nod to the style in his latest project, a 60 story office building planned for downtown Atlanta. Much of the excitement over the pending transformation of the capital of the New South started last fall with the opening of the 50 story IBM building.

Much of the excitement over the pending transformation of the capital of the New South started last fall with the opening of the 50 story IBM building. Officially called One Atlantic Center, it is a slender, post modern tower of stone with tall arched entryways and Gothic finials, dramatically crowned by a 100 foot high, eight sided copper pyramid topped by a golden lantern.

Located, respectively, next to City Center; across the street from the Chrysler Building; on 59th Street and Lexington Avenue; on 55th Street between Park and Madison avenues; and on 85th Street and Second Avenue (the America), these buildings add up to a hefty string of commissions for the 48 year old German born, Chicago based architect, whose chronological peers, if they have any opportunity to work here at all, often are still settling for additions and renovations. The bigger projects have been easier to come by in recent years, though, if an architect could demonstrate willingness (in this case, eagerness) to provide the maximum superficial splash for the fewest possible dollars, thereby endearing himself to real estate developers who are looking for an edge in a competitive market.

A Japanese real estate company is close to buying the world's tallest building for at least $1.2 billion, a Los Angeles firm representing the prospective buyer said Wednesday, but the skyscraper's present owner said it wasn't involved in any sale negotiations. Sears, Roebuck and Co., which put the famed 110 story Sears Tower up for sale on Oct. 31, said speculation that a Japanese buyer was close to a deal was groundless. We are compiling a financial analysis, which is the first step in the offering process, Sears said in a statement.

When the 50 story Seattle First National Bank Building was completed in 1969, it towered over the downtown area like a lone Douglas fir over a stand of alder. Today, the same building is lost in a skyscraper forest, and critics of the city's Manhattanization are pressing voters Tuesday to approve size limits on new downtown buildings. In a city often touted as one of the most livable in the nation, much of downtown has been cast into shadow, cut off from sunny day vistas of Mount Rainier, Puget Sound and the Olympic and Cascade mountains.

A decade of noisy construction in downtown Hartford has given way to eerie silence. In one five day period, Hartford ranked near the bottom of a national survey of economic growth in urban areas, a once popular restaurant across the street from City Hall unexpectedly shut down permanently, and, in an emotional blow to the entire downtown, Sage Allen &amp; Co. announced plans to close its 101 year old department store on Main Street. I was devastated, Mayor Carrie Saxon Perry said of the Sage Allen closing.

Instead, they see the Unocal building's fate as a precursor to the preservationists' major battle of the '90s: the fight to save buildings that are too young to live. For 25 years, preservationists have used federal and state laws, tax breaks and public relations campaigns to force and persuade landlords not to destroy or alter significant old buildings.

Wind gusting to more than 50 mph hurled debris into windows at the Sears Tower early today, damaging 90 panes and forcing police to close streets around the world's tallest building, authorities said. But police said there were no reports of injuries from falling glass. Initially, building officials reported that 19 windows were broken and six others were cracked on the east and southeast sides of the 110 story building, said Ernie Arms, a spokesman for Sears, Roebuck and Co., whose corporate headquarters are in the building.

What happened is something flying through the air like a pebble from the roof of another building hit and broke one window and then others were damaged as that one window came down. The broken and cracked windows were located between the 50th and 88th floors and are among 16,000 windows in the 1,454 foot tall building.

Just over a year ago, Sears announced its intention to sell the 15 year old tower as part of a corporate restructuring designed to halt a slide in its profitability. The restructuring, which brought major changes in the retailer's merchandising and pricing policies, also included moving Sears' retail division headquarters from the tower to an office complex that will be built in suburban Hoffman Estates. Sears began exploring the refinancing option in September after a prospective sale of the 1,707 foot building to Canadian developer Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. collapsed.
