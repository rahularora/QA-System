There was a motley crew for Verdi's Aida on Wednesday, motlier than I can remember seeing at the Royal Opera and that was just the audience, who ran from American neglige (greying T shirts, busted chinos) to bold chic imported from deeply foreign countries. It was a nice touch for the RO to have imported another motley new cast, unable to communicate with one another nor even, apparently, with the conductor Edward Downes. I have to report that by the end, most of the audience were vociferously delighted.

I was interfering,' ruining the baboons! It took time, but Strum overcame her disillusionment with her colleagues and won many of them over. As that crisis resolved, however, she faced a crisis of a different sort in Africa: The baboons she had come to know so intimately were in danger; the undeveloped ranch on which they had been allowed to roam had been sold, and it was being divided into 5 acre and 10 acre parcels.

The Cabrillo festival was begun 29 years ago by the dean of California composers, the wonderfully lyric and unpredictably multicultural Lou Harrison, as a quirky chamber music series in a coffee house hangout for Cabrillo College students in nearby Aptos. It grew quickly, moving to the college itself and later to a convivial circus tent on a thrilling site at the Santa Cruz campus of the University of California, overlooking the sparkling bay. In 1974, it hired an up and coming young conductor, Dennis Russell Davies, then music director of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra.

The opera best made for Santa Fe has to be The Magic Flute: thunderstorms are almost guaranteed to be rolling around the nearby mountains as the sky darkens during performances in the open theatre, and Sarastro's crew are right at home in a city whose 20th century psychic history goes back from the shamanic healers and Eriksonian hypnotists of today to a 1911 Masonic temple shaped as a Moorish fantasy in strawberry mousse. Almost inevitably, the piece is a regular here. This year's new production, though, cut away from awesomeness and spirituality to side with Papageno's vulgar good sense.

Indeed, more pressing issues are now in the making as the campus anticipates what may well turn out to be the main event of the year a strike by the dining hall and clerical workers' unions. Juniors and seniors dread a repeat of the 1984 strike, when workers picketing in front of the library shouted, You're walking on the bodies of dead women. President Bart Giamatti resigned relatively soon after the strike was settled.

Before long, posters around campus asked Where's Benno?, a pointed comment on the low visibility of Yale's new president, Benno Schmidt. This year's strike, threatened for January, is going to be an important confrontation for him. It's rumored that a law firm known for strike busting has already been hired, but students are still uncertain if Mr. Schmidt has enough savvy to handle the situation and keep the dining halls open.

It's rumored that a law firm known for strike busting has already been hired, but students are still uncertain if Mr. Schmidt has enough savvy to handle the situation and keep the dining halls open. What I find myself wondering about is how a university as old and established as Yale can still have the energy to transform itself so utterly every 10 years.
