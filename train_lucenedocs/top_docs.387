Max Baucus remembers well the surprise defeat that Montana voters dealt fellow Democratic Sen. John Melcher in 1988, and he's maneuvering early to avoid a similar fate. The two term senator faces little challenge in the Democratic primary on June 5, but he's amassing a stash of campaign cash to combat the winner of the four way Republican primary. Baucus has raised about $2 million for what he expects will be a $2.5 million campaign, the most expensive in the history of rural Montana.

Reagan announced Wednesday he would not sign a bill designating 1.43 million acres of roadless national forest land in Montana as federally protected wilderness.

President Reagan exercised pocket vetoes Wednesday on a bill designating 1.43 million acres of Forest Service land in Montana as wilderness as well as on a measure establishing a corporation to provide development capital to Indian businesses, the White House announced. By exercising the pocket vetoes after Congress adjourned for the year, there is no chance of overrides. In a statement concerning the Montana wilderness bill, Reagan said, Enactment of the bill would injure the economy of Montana.

One mission completed, one to go, former San Francisco Mayor Feinstein told supporters after securing her victory in a hard fought primary. With 99 percent of the precincts counted, she had 52 percent of the vote, to 41 percent for Attorney General John Van de Kamp.

He devoted most of the speech to a strident attack on the opposition, who control the Senate by a 55 45 margin and the House by 257 176. Bush is hoping to wrest back control of the Senate for the GOP in this fall's 34 Senate races. With the Democrats now in the control of the United States Congress, both houses, we're facing government by gridlock in Washington, with spending skyrocketing out of control, good legislation thrown aside for pork barrel programs and a budget deficit looming over our children's children, Bush said.

Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes, a Democrat, was favored to win a third term. Opponents of gun control forced a referendum on a new state law that creates a nine member board to determine which handguns can be sold in the state and which will be banned. The National Rifle Association said it would spend between $4 million and $5 million to defeat a bill that it said could make Maryland the first state to ban the sale of all handguns.
