An American tropical insect expert faces a possible prison term in Brazil for backing native Indians trying to stop the building of hydroelectric dams that could flood their tribal lands in the Amazon. Darrell Posey, 41, a native of Henderson, Ky., who holds a Ph.D. from the University of Georgia, has been charged by Brazil's federal police under a law that prohibits foreigners from getting involved in internal Brazilian affairs and denigrating the country's image. The maximum penalty is three years in prison, followed by expulsion.

A judge has suspended the trial of two Indian chiefs and a American who were charged with criticizing Brazil during a trip to the United States, an official said Wednesday. Federal Judge Milton Luiz Pereira on Tuesday halted the trial of American Darrell Posey and chiefs Kube I and Paulo Paiakan because of unsound accusations and a lack of just cause, Claudia de Oliveira, an official in the Federal Appeals Court, said by telephone from Brasilia. Kube I and Paiakan, both of the Kayapo tribe, and Posey, 41, a native of Henderson, Ky., and an expert on tropical insects, were accused of breaking Brazil's foreigners law during a trip last year to the United States, where they denounced the white man's encroachment upon Indian lands in Brazil.

The Indians invited President Jose Sarney and ranking Cabinet ministers to the meeting, but the government sent Fernando Mesquita, president of the Brazilian Environment Institute. Boos and whistles came from the crowd when Mesquita said: We recognize that great indignities were committed against the Indian people, but now it is a question of national awareness.

A U.S. anthropologist and two Amazon Indian chiefs were arraigned Friday on charges of engaging in illegal political activities and could be expelled from Brazil. Darrell Posey, 41, of Henderson, Ky., and chiefs Paulo Paiakan and Kube I of the Kayapo tribe were accused of breaking Brazil's Foreigners Law during a trip to the United States this year. The law, passed in 1980 when Brazil was under a military government, prohibits non Brazilian residents or visitors from speaking out publicly on domestic political issues.

Chiefs of Amazon Indian tribes ended a historic meeting Friday with a demand to stop plans to build a hydroelectric dam that would flood native lands. Hundreds of Indians, wearing colored feathers, beads and red and black paint, stood and chanted their support as Indian leader Ailton Krenac read an appeal to protect Amazonia, home to most of Brazil's 220,000 native people. We do not want the construction of dams on the Xingu River and on other rivers in the Amazon, because they threaten Indian nations, he said.

Environmentalists are pleased with their initial success three years after they began challenging governments, industries and banks. But an area the size of a soccer field is destroyed each minute, and the young preservation movement seeks fundamental changes in political, economic and social structures to save the teeming jungles of South America, Africa and Southeast Asia.

Some recent fruits of that effort: Brazil in October announced suspension of tax benefits for landowners who destroy the Amazon rain forest, the largest and fastest disappearing on Earth. The International Tropical Timber Organization approved a $4 million project in northern Brazil that calls for loggers to consult with environmental groups, government agencies, native Indians and local workers to plan long term forest development and preservation. Some 500 Brazilian Indians from 20 tribes gathered last month to oppose planned hydroelectric dams in the Amazon that could flood rain forest areas, including their homes.

A church group on Wednesday denounced the slaying of 36 Indians during 1988 and blamed the government of President Jose Sarney for increasing violence against native populations in Brazil. At least 28 of the deaths were linked to battles over land, and in the majority of cases authorities took no measures to find or punish the guilty parties, Antonio Brand, executive secretary of the Indian Missionary Council, said in a press conference. Brand said the worst Indian massacre last year was the March 28 slaying of 14 Tikuna Indians in the far northern state of Amazonas after a dispute over land with a wealthy wood dealer.

He said Brazil will also explore alternative energy sources such as solar, wind and biomass energy instead of building the huge hydroelectric dams that were popular in recent decades. Environmentalists have opposed the dams saying they flood huge tracts of Amazon land, killing trees and animals while providing few benefits for the thousands of Indians and Brazilian farmers living in the area. He specifically singled out the Itaipu dam, built by Brazil and Paraguay on the Parana River dividing the countries and the Tucurui project in the Amazon jungle.

BFN <F P=106> [Report by Marco Antonio Moreira] </F> [Text] Brasilia, 21 Jun (AE) To offset the setback suffered by Brazilian Ambassador to Portugal Jose Aparecido de Oliveira over the last minute cancellation of his trip to Lisbon, President Itamar Franco today asked former President Jose Sarney (who is a senator for the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, Amapa State) to head the Brazilian delegation to the Seminar on Economic and Entrepreneurial Cooperation and to the signing of the declaration creating the Community of Portuguese speaking Countries (CPLP). Sarney promptly accepted the invitation, which was extended personally by Franco. Sarney returned from France on 20 June.

Thousands of gold prospectors expelled from Yanomami Indian lands have invaded other Amazon reserves and spread malaria among the tribes, an Indian chief said Thursday. The claims were made as representatives from 12 indigenous groups of the far western Amazon state of Roraima came to the capital in search of medical aid. The Indian chiefs also want the government to demarcate their lands and expel the miners.

Name the remotest part of the Amazon rainforest to Diogenes Sales Alves and with the flick of a few switches on his computer he can tell you how much if any deforestation the area has suffered, when and how it happened, whether it contains any Indian settlements, any mining or agricultural activity. Alves is head of a research project at the Brazilian Aerospace Institute (INPE) to compile from satellite images the first comprehensive analysis of the world's largest rainforest. The project, detailing everything down to the last nut gatherer, is expected to be completed by April.

The government has announced a $4 million operation to remove tens of thousands of illegal gold miners from the Amazon jungle lands of the Yanomami Indians, one of the world's largest primitive tribes. The operation is a response to an international outcry to protect the Yanomamis from disease and violence brought by the miners, said the National Indian Office in Brasilia, the capital. We're backed by a presidential decree and humanitarian reasons.

In a quiet, though dramatic, reversal of policy, Brazil is now accepting foreign offers of help to save the Amazon wilderness, the world's largest, from destruction. The government, which early this year rebuffed a United Nations proposal to swap some of its $112 billion foreign debt for investments in Amazon protection programs, recently told Britain and West Germany it would work with them to curb damage, mostly by burning, to the huge rain forest. In August, Brazil accepted Italian and Canadian planes for local authorities to police the jungle.

According to Senator Jose Richa, the idea is to wait and allow the government to reedit on 29 March the provisional measure with changes clarifying the date for salary conversions into URV. This will thus put a final end to the political crisis among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

In a quiet, though dramatic, reversal of policy, Brazil is now accepting foreign offers of help to save the Amazon wilderness, the world's largest, from destruction. The government, which early this year rebuffed a United Nations proposal to swap some of its $112 billion foreign debt for investments in Amazon protection programs, recently told Britain and West Germany it would work with them to curb damage, mostly by burning, to the huge rain forest. In August, Brazil accepted Italian and Canadian planes for local authorities to police the jungle.
