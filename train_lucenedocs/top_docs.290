After being brushed by several hurricanes this year, the eastern Caribbean islands may get the brunt of Hurricane Hugo as it churns westward with 150 mph winds, forecasters said Friday. It looks like this one is not going to miss the islands like the others, said Jack Beven, a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables. It's on the most southerly course of any this year and that should keep it down in the Caribbean longer.

Killer hurricanes like Hugo, which left at least 25 dead, tens of thousands homeless and millions of dollars in damages in its rampage through the eastern Caribbean, make Sheets a household name when they threaten the U.S. mainland. A typical half hour for Sheets: do live feeds for the networks and local television stations; squeeze in a few minutes with a print reporter; grab a phone to talk with a government official in Myrtle Beach, S.C.; consult with his team of forecasters on incoming data.

It strengthened more than we thought it would, Sheets said, adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding as it moved up the Appalachians. The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm's tidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a normal 5 foot high tide that peaks after 2 a.m. On top of that will be waves, Sheets said earlier, and in many places on barrier islands the buildings will be swept clean off.

Tropical Storm Hugo would soon strengthen into a hurricane as it churned across the Atlantic toward the Caribbean, forecasters said Tuesday, and Gabrielle whipped up heavy swells as it moved away from Nova Scotia. Hugo, the eighth named storm of this Atlantic hurricane season, had winds of 65 mph with stronger gusts in squalls, and forecasters said conditions were right for it to grow stronger. It still looks impressive on the satellite imagery, meaning it has continued to strengthen some, forecaster Max Mayfield of the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables said, adding that Hugo could be up to 74 mph hurricane strength winds in a day or two.

But this year's batch did not include the devastating storms of years past and at least one forecaster thinks 1991 will be a calmer year. The season ends today.

Hugo became a hurricane Wednesday evening as it sped westward toward the Caribbean, but forecasters said it was too early to determine whether it was a threat to land. The longer it heads west, the more concern it is to us, said Hal Gerrish, a forecaster for the National Hurricane Center. But we're not sure yet where it will go there are too many things that can happen.

Hurricane Hugo ripped away rooftops and uprooted trees in Guadeloupe and Dominica early Sunday and approached other popular resort islands of the eastern Caribbean with deadly winds of up to 140 mph. Forecasters described Hugo as extremely dangerous and said it could be the most powerful hurricane to hit the region since Hurricane David in 1979. That storm killed an estimated 1,200 people in the Caribbean and Florida.

Hurricane Hugo, the Caribbean killer blamed for 25 deaths, seethed past the Bahamas Tuesday on an uncertain path that threatens an area from Florida to North Carolina by Friday. Disaster teams found death and destruction in Puerto Rico and a string of resort islands clobbered by the mightiest storm in a decade in the northeastern Caribbean. More than 50,000 people were homeless, and military planes ferried radios, drinking water, generators, chainsaws and other equipment to stricken areas that pleaded for more help.

Hurricane Hugo smashed ashore last Sept. 21 with 135 mph wind and a 19 foot storm surge that caused an estimated $5.9 billion damage and killed 29 people in South Carolina. While most structures in Charleston have been cleaned and repaired, recovery in outlying areas has taken longer. Officials of the state Department of Mental Health, which operates the outreach program, say as many as 20,000 South Carolinians suffering post traumatic stress syndrome are expected to develop long term psychological problems as a result of the storm.

A tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico showed signs of growing into a hurricane Friday, threatening to swamp coastal areas already facing abnormally high tides and prompting the evacuation of offshore oil rigs. Tropical Storm Jerry, which developed rapidly from a tropical depression off the Mexican coast on Friday, had maximum sustained winds of 70 mph and appeared to be gaining intensity, according to the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables. The center issued a hurricane watch from Port Arthur, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River.

Congress and the American people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isn't true, Emmanuel said. Satellites can give a pretty picture, he said, but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricane's path.

Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving every year so long range forecasting should become more precise. We have to remember that those models used are only guidance products, Pyke said, and that it's ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storm's path.

Amid the uproar of live coverage by the major networks and scores of other media organizations, National Hurricane Center forecasters went about their business of monitoring Hurricane Hugo. The whole system looks chaotic, but it works, said Bob Sheets, the center's director. On one side of a large room dominated by a U shaped bank of monitoring equipment were the forecasters, making meticulous calculations about where the deadly hurricane will strike and getting emergency operations going in those areas.

Since people can't move around and almost all communications are cut, it is possible there's more information that has not been passed along, he said.

The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season begins today amid dire warnings that killer storms on the East and Gulf coasts in the last two years may have been harbingers of a new era of destructive storms. The hurricane season runs until Nov. 30 and was ushered in by a tropical depression last week in the Caribbean that brought heavy rain to Cuba and south Florida but did not intensify into a hurricane. Many coastal communities, with swelling populations, are ill prepared to handle a hurricane emergency, said Robert Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center.

Hundreds of workers fled oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico as Tropical Storm Jerry inched toward the coasts of Texas and Louisiana. A hurricane watch was issued this morning for the coast from Port Arthur, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River, with landfall somewhere along that area forecast for Sunday at the earliest. The storm weakened slightly this morning and also was found to be farther away from land than first thought and moving more slowly, said forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla. Jerry developed rapidly from a tropical depression off the Mexican coast and by early today had maximum sustained winds of 70 mph.

Giant Hurricane Gabrielle, its tail winds swamping homes and businesses as far south as Barbados, may have reached peak force as its swirling clouds spread further over the Atlantic, forecasters said late Tuesday. Experts, however, said it was too early to draw conclusions from U.S. Air Force reconnaissance plane readings of rising barometric pressure and a slightly expanding eye in the hurricane, which brushed by the U.S. Caribbean islands before turning its 135 mph winds northward. Hurricane forecasters said Gabrielle appeared to be heading toward the British island of Bermuda in the Atlantic, but was still at least three days away and on an uncertain course that seemed to be moving from a northwesterly course to northward.

The greenhouse effect may breed bigger and deadlier hurricanes in the future, storms up to 50 percent stronger than Hugo and last year's record setting Gilbert, some meteorologists say. Hugo blasted the eastern Caribbean and the Carolinas with 135 mph winds this past week, killing at least 41 people. Just before Hugo struck the U.S. coast, its pressure was measured at 940 millibars.

The remnants of Hurricane Hugo made a surprise sweep through West Virginia on Friday, downing power and telephone lines, snapping trees and causing flooding before fizzling and meandering toward Ohio. There's basically nothing left of him, said weather service meteorologist Alan Reznek in Charleston, W.Va. His punch is gone. The center of the storm advanced farther westward than expected, targeting eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania and western New York before it was expected to wear itself out in Canada.

Residents from Florida to North Carolina stocked up on groceries, flashlights and window reinforcing tape for Hurricane Hugo's expected assault and the Navy sent ships to sea today to ride out the killer storm. Looting broke out on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands in the wake of the storm blamed for at least 25 deaths in the Caribbean. President Bush declared the islands a disaster area, and the government made available $500,000 for food and emergency supplies there.
