MARV LEVY, Harvard graduate, history buff and poetry lover, talks a mean game of American football. The silver haired head coach of the Buffalo Bills analyses the strategies and tactics of the sport in a precise, elegant manner. His comments in press conferences can come laced with literary allusions.

RECENT New York Knicks' basketball games at Madison Square Garden have been a bit like a night at the Oscars, so hungry has Hollywood on the Hudson been to associate itself with the best sports story in town. In recent weeks, Jack, Dusty, Woody, Spike and Arnold have all been there, tasting the special atmosphere that New York generates every time it looks as if one of the city's teams is on the verge of greatness. When the baseball Mets won the World Series in 1986, New York went berserk, as it did the last time the Knicks won a championship, in 1973.

The soft drink giant, the National Football League and NBC announced Monday they would cooperate in a three dimensional broadcast of the 12 minute Super Bowl XXIII halftime show and a 45 second Diet Coke ad next month. The Atlanta based company said its bottlers would distribute the special glasses, which will enable fans to see the 3 D approach, with purchases of Diet Coke in the two weeks before the Jan. 22 contest for the NFL championship. Coca Cola ordered the glasses earlier this year after agreeing with the Moonlighting producers that a commercial and a portion of the final show of the 1987 88 season would be shot with the new 3 D technology.

Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent the already bearish Tokyo stock market plummeting, and traders said the trend is likely to continue. The dollar yen exchange rate, meanwhile, settled into a range of around 147 to 148 yen to the dollar after major fluctuations early in the crisis. Analysts predicted that the strength of the Japanese economy, and the relative weakness of the U.S. economy, would keep the exchange rate hovering around the same level until the Middle East stalemate breaks.

CBS, the US media group, yesterday reported a first quarter operating profit of Dollars 19.5m, a substantial recovery from the Dollars 54.6m loss incurred at the same stage of 1991 when the Gulf war, a slump in advertising demand and restructuring charges sent the company deep into the red. The earnings were greeted warmly on Wall Street, and CBS shares rose Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 184 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange in early trading. Improvements in operating results at the CBS's nationwide network and its group of regional television stations, and savings from reductions in underlying costs, were the main reason behind the turnround in earnings, said the company.

'We've got tool and die makers selling hardware at the department store, waiting for the right job to come along,' says Mr Stephenson of Arizona Public Service. Local economists say growth this time around is built on much more solid foundations than the construction boom of the mid 1980s, which burst spectacularly when the tax breaks which had prompted it were repealed. This year, construction activity has been centred on single family homes, with building closely tied to real demand.

This year, construction activity has been centred on single family homes, with building closely tied to real demand. The boom in this sector is now slowing down, as pent up demand from the recession has now largely been satisfied, and is expected to glide down to a pace tied to the state's population growth, forecast at around 2.6 per cent a year.

Still, there is one sign of speculative overheating that the Fed might want to keep an eye on. The Arizona Cardinals American football team plays in a first rate stadium deemed good enough to host the Superbowl national football championship game in 1996, but Mr Bill Bidwill, the team owner, is already talking about building a new stadium.

After years of being considered the little sibling of broadcast television, some say the cable TV industry is beginning to look more like Goliath than David. Cable TV, now watched by more than 50 percent of all American households, has become a $12 billion industry that is gaining viewers steadily, mostly at the expense of the broadcast networks. But with prosperity comes increased scrutiny, and in cable's case Congress has been raising questions about concentration of ownership within the industry, complaints of poor service and rising rates.

An extraordinary two years of new business wins have bolstered Goodby's billings above the $200 million mark, transforming it from a small regional shop into a national, mid sized agency. Agency Chairman and Chief Executive Andy Berlin said, however, that because the agency hasn't handled lucrative media purchasing for its clients, its revenues were more like those of a small agency, $15 million to $18 million. Mr. Berlin said the acquisition brings the agency abilities a small San Francisco agency can't muster, including media buying clout and additional marketing services.

President Reagan shed a symbolic burden at the Moscow summit that he had carried for five years his own description of the Kremlin as an evil empire. It was a remark that Reagan had uttered only once, but it had burned in the Soviet consciousness since 1983, an oft quoted and inescapable reminder of superpower tensions. Finally, to the private delight of White House officials, it was gone.
