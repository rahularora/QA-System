American inventor Philo T. Farnsworth, a pioneer of television, was accorded what many believe was long overdue glory Wednesday when a 7 foot bronze likeness of the electronics genius was dedicated in the U.S. Capitol. With his 81 year old widow, Elma Farnsworth, looking on, the inventor was extolled as the father of television and his statue was placed in the pantheon of famous Americans of the Capitol's National Statuary Hall. I think it's an honor long overdue, said Bruce Barnson, who headed a commission that raised $250,000 to place Farnsworth near the likeness of a better known Utahn, Brigham Young.

An inventor said Wednesday he has developed three dimensional television, beating the world's electronics giants. We think that just as black and white was converted into color, so will color be converted into 3 D, said the 33 year old British inventor, James Ashbey. The technology does not require special glasses or screens.

The technology does not require special glasses or screens. It can convert all new and existing black and white and color films into 3 D, along with live broadcasts, animation and computer graphics, said his company, Delta Group.

From the days when inventor Thomas Edison's light bulb first lit the nights of 1879, Americans have been regarded as naturally inventive and creative. Much of that innovation derives from the work of scientists and engineers at General Electric's Research and Development Center, which traces its roots to the Edison Electrical Light Company formed in 1878 to support the experiments of Thomas Edison. GE scientists brainstormed the magnetic resonance imager, which uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create pictures of internal organs without X rays.

A New York inventor filed suit against Texas Instruments Inc. alleging patent infringement on his integrated circuits for flat television displays for computers. The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, seeks unspecified damages and attorneys' fees. Michael I. Rackman, the inventor and a lawyer, who filed the suit through his firm, alleges Dallas based Texas Instruments infringed upon his two patents for the electroluminescent TV system and liquid crystal television display system.

BFN <F P=106> [From the National News Hookup program] </F> [Text] [Reporter] This reporter has learned from the department concerned that since China promulgated its Patent Law 10 years ago, the legitimate rights and interests of patent holders of all countries have been effectively protected in this country. According to Supreme People's Court President Ren Jianxin, China's courts at various levels have handled some 1,900 cases of patent disputes and some 1,600 have been settled as of the end of 1993. At the same time, the patent administrative organs at various levels handled more than 2,200 patent dispute cases and settled some 1,700 of them.

Traditional academic openness is going by the boards in the race to understand cold nuclear fusion as scholars withhold findings that could make them big money. A broad patent on cold nuclear fusion could be worth billions of dollars if the invention turns out to provide a new way of producing cheap, clean and abundant energy. But the lure of money is inhibiting exploration of cold fusion claims by making researchers withhold information to protect their patent positions, lawyers and scholars said Thursday.

While such rhetoric raised eyebrows at home, the West began to take note of Mr. Nishizawa's inventions. McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Westinghouse Electric Corp., he says, were first to show interest in a device called the static induction transistor, or SIT. And in 1983, the California based Electrical Power Research Institute agreed to test a Nishizawa device called an SI thyristor after Japanese companies had refused even to look at it.

NOKIA Consumer Electronics, the third biggest maker of televisions in Europe, is investing Pounds 24m in a television picture tube factory in Germany. The company is to adapt production lines at its Esslingen factory to make picture tubes for wide screen TV, which European electronics manufacturers hope will be the next mass selling consumer product in the television market. Nokia, a Finnish group, will also build a 6,000 square metre extension to the factory and install highly automated Black Matrix tube machinery.

The latest U.S. company to drop out was mighty General Electric Co., which decided in 1987 that the GE and RCA television lines were not core businesses and sold them to France's Thomson SA. It was widely assumed that if GE got out of televisions, Zenith, at a tenth the size, could not be far behind. Some Wall Street analysts became exasperated when Pearlman hung onto the money losing business after all.

EDITOR'S NOTE With so many experiments under way at the same time, it's difficult to pinpoint television's birthplace. Among the cities that lay claim to TV firsts is Schenectady, N.Y. There, 60 years ago, a handful of viewers witnessed the first broadcast to television sets installed in the home.

The flickering pink picture of a man playing a ukulele was a small miracle in an age of wonder, all but forgotten beyond the town once known as The City That Lights The World. The year was 1928, and Schenectady had grown from a sleepy hamlet on the Erie Canal to a booming factory town where the General Electric Co. had its headquarters and its finest research talent. For two years, Ernst Fredrik Werner Alexanderson, a consulting engineer for GE and the Radio Corporation of America, had been tinkering with a machine that used perforated spinning disks to transmit pictures.

Compton's, however, is determined to assert its patent rights. 'We simply want the public to recognise Compton's NewMedia as the pioneer in this industry, promote a standard that can be used by every developer and be compensated for the investments we have made to make multimedia a reality for developers and end users,' said Stanley Frank, president and chief executive. The dispute has raised strong feelings in the software industry because it comes just as multimedia products appear set to break into the mainstream of personal computing.

He says that these innovators, whether on a payroll or on their own, have been routinely ripped off by lawyer driven, bureaucratic companies and as a result are holding back breakthroughs that could transform life on earth and America's competitive posture. Mr. Hyatt says his wealth will be devoted to lionizing the nation's inventors and securing their legal rights. In semiconductor circles, however, this little guy's triumph is widely seen as precisely the wrong medicine for what ails homegrown high tech.
