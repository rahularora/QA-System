The widely reported collaboration between Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, and Sega, the Japanese video game manufacturer, now appears unlikely to create a significant role for Microsoft in video game software. A senior Sega USA official said that Microsoft, contrary to earlier reports, was not developing an operating system for Saturn, the next generation Sega video game machine. Such reports led many industry observers to conclude that Microsoft aimed to establish worldwide software standards in the video game arena, just as it has in personal computer software.

Industry analysts said, however, that the move may be 'too little, too late' because while the PowerPC partners have established a hardware standard, they have failed to agree on an operating system software standard.

Instead, the companies said they would build computers that adhere to a new 'hardware reference platform' specification that will run a broad range of software. The standard PowerPC design will support several operating systems including Apple's Macintosh software, IBM's OS/2 and AIX (a variety of UNIX) and Microsoft's Windows NT, the companies said.

Rogers Cablesystems, Canada's biggest cable TV operator, is to co operate with Microsoft to install the US software group's new interactive television software, known as Tiger. Tiger is one of several competing software systems being developed, which will deliver video on demand, shopping, education and other services to cable TV subscribers. Rogers has signed a letter of intent to license the Tiger system, and take part in early testing of Microsoft's operating system for interactive broadband cable networks.

Microsoft and Tele Communications (TCI) have agreed to test interactive cable television technology jointly in Seattle, Washington. The tests could establish software standards for TCI's networks which reach more than 10m cable television customers throughout the US. The agreement is the first move into interactive television by Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, and the first deployment of 'information superhighway' technology by TCI, the largest US cable television company.

The agreement between IBM and Microsoft has been dubbed a 'divorce settlement' because it ends almost two years of acrimony which began when the companies chose different paths towards the development of a new generation of PC software. IBM and Microsoft had worked closely together since IBM chose Microsoft's 'DOS' program for its original PC 12 years ago.

The companies have now agreed to license each other to use IBM's OS/2 and Microsoft's Windows programs until the end of 1993.

When Microsoft's popular 'Windows' program received a 'Best New Business Software Product' award at a recent computer software industry event in San Francisco, the audience of industry executives booed and hissed. This outburst of public animosity reflects rising resentment towards Microsoft among its competitors and even some of its partners in the personal computer industry, who charge that the company is using 'bully tactics' to expand its dominant position in the market for personal computer programs. Industry grumbles have now come to the attention of the US Federal Trade Commission which has told Microsoft that it is conducting a broad anti trust investigation into 'third party allegations that the company has monopolised or has attempted to monopolise the market for operating systems, operating environments, computer software and computer peripherals for personal computers'.

Making a rare public forecast, Microsoft Corp. officials predicted Friday that industrywide sales of personal computers, which swelled 30% in the company's fiscal year ended June 30, 1987, will grow at a 26% clip this fiscal year. The personal computer software company also said it doesn't expect the majority of personal computer users to buy its much ballyhooed, new OS/2 operating system until 1990 or 1991. According to Microsoft's best estimates, said Steven Ballmer, vice president, systems software, personal computer sales grew to 6.5 million units in fiscal 1987 from five million units the year earlier.

Currently, Novell is the leading supplier of software that manages the communications between computers linked on networks. Microsoft, however, leads the market for personal computer operating systems.

MICROSOFT, the US computer software group, is in talks with Time Warner, the entertainment group, and Tele Communications Inc, the big cable television company, to set up a joint venture to develop interactive software for television, according to news reports. Although the three companies have not commented on the reports, their negotiations are expected to lead to the establishment of a new company producing software for cable television boxes. The software would provide cable subscribers with access to a wide array of interactive information and services.

Microsoft's stock was jolted, falling $3.50 to $95.75 in national over the counter trading on news of the investigation into the Redmond, Wash., company, the country's largest supplier of personal computer software. Mr. Gates said that the FTC probe, which began last June, also covers International Business Machines Corp., the nation's largest computer maker and a key Microsoft partner for a decade. He said that the probe strictly flows out of a joint announcement from the two companies in November 1989 regarding mutual software plans.

DESPITE their long history, open systems are only now becoming a meaningful reality. The trap of closed proprietary systems, which held most large computer users in thrall for three decades, is finally fading to be replaced by a freer, more flexible world of open systems, writes Phil Manchester.

The trap of closed proprietary systems, which held most large computer users in thrall for three decades, is finally fading to be replaced by a freer, more flexible world of open systems, writes Phil Manchester. In March this year an important group of leading computer manufacturers and software developers announced its intention to put differences on one side and co operate in devising a Common Open Software Environment (Cose). Hewlett Packard, IBM, Santa Cruz Operation, Sunsoft, Univel and Unix Systems Laboratories agreed to work towards a Cose 'standard' based on the Unix operating system.

Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, which is being investigated by the anti trust division of the US Justice Department, is attempting to blunt new industry charges that it tried to limit the competitive activities of other software developers. Microsoft angered computer industry executives and drew renewed attention from the Justice Department last week, when it became known the company had asked at least three software companies Borland International, Lotus Development and WordPerfect to sign restrictive 'non disclosure agreements' (NDAs) if they got pre release copies of a new version of Windows, Microsoft's personal computer operating system program. Microsoft now says it 'made a mistake' in demanding that the software companies agree not to allow some of their programmers to work on products that compete with Microsoft's Windows program for three years as a pre condition to granting them early access to the new version.

THE US Justice Department's decision to pursue an anti trust investigation of Microsoft makes it increasingly likely that the world's largest computer software company will face charges of illegal anti competitive business practices. Justice officials disclosed on Friday they had initiated an inquiry after a preliminary review of evidence gathered by the Federal Trade Commission in its three year anti trust probe of the company. Simultaneously, the FTC said it had voted to close its investigation of Microsoft after deadlocking in February and again in July on whether to take action against the company.

Microsoft competitors have also expressed concerns to FTC investigators about the company's alleged practice of favouring its own applications programs developers by giving them early access to new versions of operating system software, thus putting competitors at a disadvantage.

So by selling off USL to Novell, has AT&amp;T thrown away the idea of an independent Unix? And if it has, does it matter? The answer to the latter question would seem to be 'No', judging by the lack of controversy over the proposed sale.

And if it has, does it matter? The answer to the latter question would seem to be 'No', judging by the lack of controversy over the proposed sale. Why should that be?

The answer to the latter question would seem to be 'No', judging by the lack of controversy over the proposed sale. Why should that be? One possible answer is that AT&amp;T and the rest of the industry are already anticipating that Windows NT will be the operating system of the future and have thrown in the towel.

Why should that be? One possible answer is that AT&amp;T and the rest of the industry are already anticipating that Windows NT will be the operating system of the future and have thrown in the towel. Windows NT standing for 'New Technology' is Microsoft's first multiuser, multitasking operating system suitable for powerful network servers.

A FEW days before Christmas last year, Novell, a US computer networking company whose annual sales are now close to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) signed a letter of intent to acquire Unix Systems Laboratories, a company in which AT&amp;T has a majority stake and which is responsible for the licensing and development of the Unix computer operating system. The deal, worth Dollars 350m, has to be ratified by 11 other computer companies which own shares in USL. These include Amdahl, Fujitsu, ICL, Motorola and Sun Microsystems.

The deal, worth Dollars 350m, has to be ratified by 11 other computer companies which own shares in USL. These include Amdahl, Fujitsu, ICL, Motorola and Sun Microsystems. It is nevertheless remarkable, given the history of Unix, that there has been a dearth of comment on a development which may fundamentally reshape the open systems movement.

It may simply have been the imminence of the New Year; others see more sinister forces at work. To recap briefly: open systems imply a common set of rules for interworking so that no supplier has a technical advantage over any other in developing standard products.

Unix is one of a number of operating systems vying to be adopted as the open systems standard. The development of such an operating system would have to be free from the control of any one manufacturer or group of manufacturers. Unix was created by AT&amp;T at Bell Labs but has since been widely licensed, leading to a damaging multiplicity of 'standard' versions.
