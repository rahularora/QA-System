Her new winter line unveiled last week showed well cut sarong draped skirts, neat boleros with baroque appliqued embroidery over strapless dresses, draped chiffons, plenty of sequins and sparkle combined with lace, satin, taffeta and velvet.

After putting women in status conscious, super structured clothes with big, padded shoulders for several years, British designers have followed Milan in loosening up their styles for next summer. But there's no uniform look and individuality remains the key fashion word in the British collections, being shown through Tuesday.

Pants ranged from full and cropped to cigarette slim, under tunic tops and dressy jackets. The slightly simplified, sportier ready to wear lines led off with a blue drawstring parka over narrow madras plaid pants, and color burst out from there on often with Lacroix's ebullient mixes of flowers, checks, plaids.

Christian Lacroix kicked off a week of haute couture shows for winter Sunday with plenty of luxury and an about face in style, abandoning the short pouf skirts that made him famous and presenting a variety of styles. His show received politely enthusiastic response from the buyers and press, but there was no screaming ovation, as there was at last year's. Some found the show rather confusing, as if Lacroix didn't always know what to do with all that lovely fabric.
