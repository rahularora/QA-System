Health officials are employing psychological warfare in a nearly decade long battle against thousands of noisy starlings that descend in dense flocks each summer in certain elm lined neighborhoods. The birds keep people awake, coat cars in messy droppings and make Bob Mathis' life miserable each summer. Mathis, the village's environmental health supervisor, has tried everything over the years from wind machines to huge balloons painted with terror eyes to resemble owls.

Three ruddy cheeked people burs stuck in their clothes, snorting steam in the cold dawn come hissing and warbling out of the woods. But there's no need to flee they're part of the National Audubon Society's 91st annual Christmas Bird Count, in which bird watchers across North and South America began their tallies Saturday. When it ends Jan. 2, 42,000 birdwatchers will have counted upwards of 100 million birds.

The annual count is a good indicator of the health of our environment, said Holberton, an ornithology student at the State University of New York at Albany.

In 1971, the cliff nesting areas received protected status. In 1980 The Snake River Birds of Prey Area was established under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) 482,640 acres along an approximately 80 mile stretch of the Snake River. At last, hunting grounds on the plateaus above the canyon, vital to the survival of 15 species of falcons, eagles, hawks, owls and vultures, would be preserved.

<P> Shorebirds that migrate 7,000 miles between their winter homes in Argentina and their Arctic nesting grounds make a pit stop every spring on New Jersey beaches to feast on horseshoe crab eggs. </P> <P> New Jersey also provides safe houses between wintering and nesting grounds for many other types of migrating birds, including hawks that follow the coastline, the Delaware River and Appalachian ridges and tiny warblers looking for food in woodlands and coastal thickets. </P> <P> Naturalists have noticed alarming declines in the feathered wayfarers.

The World Bank is this month due to grant Romania Dollars 4.5m (Pounds 3m) to help preserve the Danube delta, Europe's largest remaining wetland and one of its most important wildlife sanctuaries, which is under increasing threat from industrial pollution. After years of mismanagement under Romania's former communist regime, the delta's unique ecosystems are being destroyed by the pollutants and waste accumulated by the River Danube on its 2,700km journey through the industrial heartland of Europe. The delta covers 580,000ha in eastern Romania and southern Ukraine where the Danube splits into three main branches and enters the Black Sea.

For centuries, it has provided a sanctuary for rare birds, fish and wildlife, as well as for persecuted human beings. It is home to more than 75 species of fish, rare mammals such as the European mink and wild cat, and an estimated 300 species of birds including Dalmatian pelicans, pygmy cormorants, red breasted geese, glossy ibis and several kinds of egret and heron.

</P> <P> The only one of Aitmatov's human intruders to approach the wild lands with an interest not arising from sheer rapacity, a deacon's son and former seminarian named Avdiy Kallistratov, becomes the focus of the action through the remainder of the book's first part. A self appointed, well meaning ethical crusader bent on the moral reformation of a band of teen age drug smugglers, Avdiy joins their expedition into the steppes to gather anasha, the wild cannabis plant that grows there in profusion. When his companions discover his motive is not the profits of the weed but his own obscure idealism, they beat him up and fling him from a speeding train in the middle of nowhere.

When his companions discover his motive is not the profits of the weed but his own obscure idealism, they beat him up and fling him from a speeding train in the middle of nowhere. At this point the persecuted Avdiy is seized by a vision of Christ conversing with Pontius Pilate. The scene carries obvious echoes of the Christ Pilate confrontation in Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita and seems to confirm a link with Dostoevsky as well (though Aitmatov's Christ like Avdiy, it must be said, is drawn with little of the subtlety of his famous Russian forerunner's saintly Alyosha).

Everyone knows what to do with a bird's wishbone. But what does the bird do with it? For scientists who've longed for an answer to that question while tugging at the wishbone or pullie bone, as it's also called after Sunday dinner, their wish may have finally come true.

Two Harvard University paleontologists and a Northern Arizona University physiologist say they have figured out the secret of the wishbone. To find the answer, the three scientists put some starlings in a wind tunnel and took X ray movies of the birds' skeletons as they flew in winds ranging from 20 to 40 miles per hour.

To find the answer, the three scientists put some starlings in a wind tunnel and took X ray movies of the birds' skeletons as they flew in winds ranging from 20 to 40 miles per hour. The movies show that the furcula, as the wishbone is known technically, acts like a spring when a bird is flying, report Farish Jenkens and Kenneth Dial of Harvard and Ted Goslow of Northern Arizona University in the current issue of the journal Science.

They base their theory on the air sacs that birds have scattered through their bodies, including some between the prongs of the wishbone and others near the breastbone. It's possible, the scientists say, that the moving bones alternately deflate and expand the air sacs, forcing air from one sac to another during flight.

Big Bird, a great blue heron, has turned Vivianna Biesen's goldfish pond into a snack bar. Over the past two weeks, the usually shy creature has shamelessly reduced the population in the 25 foot pond, where she and her husband have raised goldfish for 20 years, from 100 fish to 60, she said. What does Big Bird think that pond is, Midget Sound?

The Gambia has had few fair shakes since it became a British slave trading entrepot in the 18th century. An historical and geographical aberration, it is the result of commercial conflict between British and French colonial trading interests. While France, master of much of north and west Africa, laid effective claim to the huge territory of Senegal, the British were able to hang on to the Gambia River, the sluggish, mangrove bordered waterway which flows through its heart.

While France, master of much of north and west Africa, laid effective claim to the huge territory of Senegal, the British were able to hang on to the Gambia River, the sluggish, mangrove bordered waterway which flows through its heart. The result, today, is a country which, while some 300 miles long, posesses land only 15 to 30 miles wide on either side of the river.
