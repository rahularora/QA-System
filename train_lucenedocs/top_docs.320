BFN [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 28/6/1994 For a week the city of Cluj Napoca (North West of Romania, inhabited by a large Hungarian minority) has been living in a state of tension created by the conflict between the public authorities and the local branch of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR). The conflict, which is not something new, because such situations arose several times in the capital of the historical Romanian province of Transylvania, was sparkled by the intention of the local authorities to authorize, at the request of the Transylvanian History Museum, archaeological diggings in the central square of the city where the monument to Hungarian King of Romanian descent Matthias Corvinus is located. The local branch of UDMR is accusing the City Council, and Mayor Gheorghe Funar in the first place, of using the digs as a pretext to move Corvinus's statue to another location.

Judge Antonie Iorgovan, who is also professor of constitutional law of the Bucharest University, reminds that Romania's constitution does not provide such a concept because of the simple reason that there is only one government in a unitary state, politically responsible in front of the single parliament as the representative body of the Romanian nation. Antonie Iorgovan reminded also that the self governing wording was not stipulated by any unitary state's constitution in Western Europe as they consecrated a regional system of local administration and not a departmental system.

Nobody imposes Romania's union with Bessarabia by force, but to go as far as declaring that Romanians and Moldovans are different peoples is a nonsense launched by communists which Mircea Snegur, as a truthful disciple, has adopted.

BFN [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 23/06/1994 UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania] sees itself compelled to reassess the role and aim of its representation to parliament, because UDMR does not accept to act just as a stand in in the country's legislative body, runs a statement made by this party's parliamentary group leader Gyula Vida at the end of the debates on the education act. In the group's opinion, the education act in its present form is absolutely unacceptable for the Hungarian community. It (the law) enacts an obvious and unspeakable discrimination against the ethnic minorities in Romania, and at the same time, a flagrant violation of the constitution.

In the group's opinion, the education act in its present form is absolutely unacceptable for the Hungarian community. It (the law) enacts an obvious and unspeakable discrimination against the ethnic minorities in Romania, and at the same time, a flagrant violation of the constitution. The main objections UDMR has against the draft law is the restriction of the constitutional right to learn in the native tongue in all the objects of study, the abolition of the existing structures of specialized education in minority languages, the interdiction to train in higher education institutions specialists in social and economic sciences, the inacceptance to have the confessional schools reorganized and re established.

The editorial quoted above cautions that the reoccurrence in Snegur's declaration of older theses of the Soviet ideology periodically aired, first in the twenties and thirties, then in the forties and fifties and in the Brezhnev epoch, which advocate a clear distinction between the Romanian people and culture and the Moldovan people and culture. TINERETUL LIBER finds Snegur's attitude as a strategic response to Moscow's offensive attempts to regain its commanding role over its former republics, but finds no excuse for his impudence of denying his own roots, and doing this on behalf of those he is representing. The newspaper terms Bucharest's reaction as still pale and warns that Romanian should not neglect the national interest and overlook the political significance and the emotional impact Snegur's statement carries.

BFN [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 6/5/1994 The Partnership for Peace has a special significance for Romania, Gheorghe Tinca, Romanian minister of defense states in an interview with the periodical PARLAMENTUL. We were the first to sign the document framework, he recalls, adding that Romania's adherence to that programme is not only a major step, a stage towards the proper guaranteeing of national security, but it comes to answer also our determination to fully integrate within European and Euro Atlantic structures, an objective fully embraced by all political parties represented in Romania's Parliament. The adherence to the Partnership for Peace programme of all Romania's neighboring states and their commitment to observe the principles of that programme would be able to provide certain indirect guarantees for the consolidation of our national security.

In fact it is not by mere coincidence that simultaneously with the Partnership for Peace much talk is done about a Partnership for Prosperity. From the very first statements regarding the Partnership for Peace, Romania's President Ion Iliescu referred to the need for an economic partnership, a concept that should be extended not only to the European continent but to the entire world, the Romanian minister of defense concluded.

BFN [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 4/5/1994 Radu Campeanu has been acknowledged as legitimate president of the National Liberal Party (PNL) by virtue of a court sentence passed yesterday, 3 May, by the Bucharest Municipal Court, which ruled against a similar claim by the group led by Mircea Ionescu Quintus. The conflict between the two factions of the PNL, generated by the wish to reign supreme in the liberal movement, opposes Radu Campeanu, liberal member in the 1940's, repatriated in 1990 after years of residence in France, who held the PNL chairmanship over 1990 1993, and ran for the presidency of Romania in 1990, to Mircea Ionescu Quintus, lawyer and writer, liberal minister of justice in Mr. Theodor Stolojan's cabinet, 1991 1992. The conflict and tensions between these two factions and between them and other liberal splinter groups have inflicted, commentators observe, a negative image on Romania's main liberal party, which the 1990 elections had earned an important number of seats in the Parliament that functioned until the next elections of 1992 when it failed to gain the minimal share of votes for parliamentary representation.

BFN [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 20/4/1994 Romania's integration in the European political, economic, and military structures is one of the main directions of the Romanian foreign policy. Its essence lies in a process of modernization devised to include the army too, so that this could become a modern army, National Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca told a ROMPRES correspondent. This line of policy finds its reflection in the principles of military diplomacy, which mirror the efforts to develop bilateral relations with the armies of other states.

Confrontation will have to be replaced with something else, perhaps with cooperation. While pleading for a partnership formula open to all states and stressing the idea of equal security for all European states and of sovereignty and independence of their decisions for all the countries included in the partnership program, the Romanian minister said that such a formula could contribute to defining a system of general security, which, based on what already forms the skeleton of NATO, could form the necessary security umbrella apt to encourage a course to prosperity in this part of Europe, too, Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca said.
