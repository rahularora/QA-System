Three decades ago, John Kennedy, obsessed with greatness in Congress but unwilling to achieve it himself, headed a committee to select which senators to honor with portraits in the ornate Senate Reception Room. Scholars and commentators were consulted and the verdict was fairly predictable. The top three finishers were Henry Clay, Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun.

Americans wanting to sell anything from biscuits and cigars to plumbing and whiskey often have tried to cloak their wares in the presumed respectability of Congress and its most illustrious members. Daniel Webster, for example. Webster, perhaps the most famous senator and orator of the mid 19th century, had his face and his name used to promote cigars, flour, and a concoction known as Dr. J.C. Ayres Cherry Pectoral, promoted as a cure for coughs, colds, bronchitis, croup, whooping cough and other ailments.

When South Carolina's name was called, Republican Strom Thurmond gave this response: South Carolina was not the first state to be admitted, but it was the first to secede in 1860.

After the Civil War, South Carolina returned to the union in 1868. Sen. Ted Stevens, R Alaska, noted Thomas Jefferson's description of the Senate as a stage, and recalled some of the drama the present chamber has witnessed, including the one vote defeat of the attempt to oust President Andrew Johnson during Reconstruction after the Civil War, and the rejection of President Woodrow Wilson's effort to bring the United States into the League of Nations after World War I. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D Maine, said that while the Senate has undergone many changes over the years, it remains a place where the rights of the minority are protected and speech can remain virtually unlimited.

It was amusing to read James Bovard's American History: Pass a Tariff, Start a War (editorial page, July 20) in defense of free trade, because the truth about American history is that for the greater part of it, the U.S. was a strongly protectionist nation. From 1789 until the end of World War II, our country rose to become the greatest economic power on earth behind high tariff walls. The Japanese and Koreans seem to have learned more from American history than we have.

From the days President George Washington dispatched the first United States Marshals to quell the Whiskey Rebellion, the storied lawmen have been part of the country's most colorful and most violent episodes. They did the hanging for famous Hanging Judge Isaac Parker of Fort Smith, Ark., after rounding up bank and train robbers hiding in the brush of Indian Territory, smashed whiskey stills during Prohibition and protected slaves freed after the Civil War. The nation's oldest law enforcement organization, the Marshals began their bicentennial celebration Thursday with the opening of an exhibit at the Supreme Court followed by a black tie dinner at a nearby hotel.

Politicians stumped for memorable quotations to enliven their speeches need look no further than Respectfully Quoted, a newly published book from the Library of Congress that is crammed with 2,100 oratorical gems from the past. The book might give some comfort to Sen. Joseph Biden, D Del., whose 1988 presidential hopes were torpedoed partly by a controversy over cribbed comments. If Biden recalls a famous line from President Kennedy's inaugural address in 1961, he might be intrigued that Lebanese writer Kahlil Gibran asked much earlier, Are you a politician asking what your country can do for you, or a zealous one asking what you can do for your country?

A shave and a haircut used to cost nothing, if you were a United States senator and were shaved and trimmed in the United States Senate barber shop. And when one reform minded senator tried to eliminate free senatorial shaving and hair cutting 37 years ago, his shaved for free colleagues rebelled. The senator was the late Paul Douglas of Illinois, and his experience was recalled in a recent Senate speech by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas.

A marshal fired the gun that sent settlers scrambling for a homestead in the Oklahoma land run of 1889; marshals guarded the first black student at the University of Mississippi during the desegregation battles of the 1960s; they ringed the Pentagon during the Vietnam war protests of the early 1970s. They smashed whiskey stills during Prohibition and arrested gangster Al Capone twice; took the census until 1880; captured fugitive slaves before the Civil War and protected freed slaves during Reconstruction; and did the hanging for Hanging Judge Isaac Parker in Fort Smith, Ark., when Oklahoma was still Indian Territory and bank and train robbers hid in the brush.

When Abraham Lincoln received the Republican Party's nomination for president in 1860, the New York Herald dismissed him as a fourth rate lecturer, who cannot speak good grammar, and who, to raise the wind, delivers his hackneyed, illiterate compositions at $200 apiece. The man later compared to Mark Twain for his gift with the English language was nicknamed Ignoramus Abe, Old Scoundrel and Filthy Story Teller. I have endured a great deal of ridicule without much malice and received a great deal of kindness not quite free of ridicule, Lincoln once said, referring to the condescending treatment his homespun style received even from friends.

He first presented himself as lagging sadly behind a reluctant, almost embarrassed public servant, more familiar with the straight path back to his Kentucky log cabin on Nolan Creek than the winding, uphill climb to the White House. In an open letter to the people of Illinois' Sangamon County, published March 9, 1832, Lincoln offered sincere, cut and dry analyses of local issues as he urged consideration for election to the Illinois General Assembly and concluded with a near apology for taking up the voters' time. He was born Feb. 12, 1809, the second child of pioneer farmer and carpenter Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks Lincoln.

The U.S. Tax Court has upheld an IRS order denying a tax exemption to a South Carolina private school on grounds it discriminates against blacks. The absence of either a single black student in the school or a plausible explanation of inability to attract black students permits an inference of discrimination, particularly in view of ... (the school's) history, the court held. The decision, made public Monday, means that contributions to Calhoun Academy in St. Matthews, S.C., are not deductible.

The Supreme Court held that racially discriminatory schools violate fundamental public policy and cannot be viewed as conferring a benefit on the public. From the record before us, Nims wrote, it appears that white students and their parents gravitate to petitioner (Calhoun) at least in part because of a historical absence of black students: Petitioner admits that the local public schools are superior in material respects, yet considerably less expensive.

There are no individual heroes in this account of a juicy slice of American history, not even Washington, Jefferson, Madison or Jackson. Its only hero is the American people, who are celebrated with ardor in rich and dense detail. The merit of Oscar and Lilian Handlin's Liberty in Expansion: 1760 1850 (Harper &amp; Row, 481 pages, $25.95) is that it treats the grand theme of freedom in American history by keeping it close to the earth of everyday living.

It was this severing of states' rights from natural rights as much as the interest in slavery itself that drove the movement for secession in 1861. But the divorce of states' rights from natural rights not only removes any moral basis for condemning slavery but places all constitutional rights of individuals of every race or color at the mercy of the state. It was not for nothing that the late Richard Hofstadter called Calhoun the Marx of the master class.

Then, despite beating Connecticut by 20 points that evening, Thompson delivered a postgame sermon to the media that once again praised Calhoun and the Huskies. </P> <P> I think his team, in all the years I've been in the Big East, is the biggest surprise to me, Thompson said.

On the northeastern edge of the square, where the Department of Veterans Affairs has its headquarters, stood the posh Arlington Hotel, where industrialist Andrew Carnegie once spent $10,000 on a dinner party for his friends. The park originally contained a private farmhouse, apple orchard and graveyard before it was bought in 1791 to help create the capital city envisioned by George Washington.

After reinventing Aaron Burr for an age that remembered him, if at all, only as one of history's bad guys, and humanizing Abraham Lincoln who had been so wrapped in glory by Carl Sandburg's interminable, adoring biography in earlier historical novels, Mr. Vidal is working with lesser figures here in his fifth fictional treatment of American history.

L. Douglas Wilder's apparent victory in the Virginia governor's race is a watershed in American political history, in which black politicians have had but a shadowy presence. Wilder would be the nation's first elected black governor, but would not be the first black American to serve as governor. That distinction belongs to Pinckney Benton Stewart Pinchback, who became governor of Louisiana following the impeachment of Henry Clay Warmoth in 1872.

Rainey of South Carolina became the first black in the House of Representatives.

To Sen. Robert C. Byrd, the United States Senate over the last 200 years has been a rock bound channel, able to contain the onrushing passions of the moment without losing its essential and original shape and purpose. Byrd, in what he calls a labor of love, has pursued that theme in a seven pound history of the institution as it developed over the past two centuries. The book, called The Senate 1789 1989 and available through the Government Printing Office, is a lavishly illustrated and meticulous account based on 42 of the 100 speeches Byrd delivered on the floor of the Senate in an unprecedented series that began on a spring morning in 1980.

There's no doubt about that, said Thomas F. Schwartz, curator of the Lincoln collection at the Illinois State Historical Library in Springfield. On July 31, Lincoln was at least 1,000 miles west of Cape May, filing an affidavit in Sangamon County Circuit Court for Henry Bailer, who was owed $111.75 by Oliver Davis. Davis ended up paying $112.30, which Schwartz guesses included interest.

He said residents of Cape May, 50 miles south of the Mason Dixon Line and site of several duels between Northerners and Southerners in the 1840s and 1850s, may have been trying to prove their loyalty to the Union after the Civil War by circulating the story.

Amid the stories about the two resigned Justice Department officials yesterday, the Washington Post had another story: Independent Counsel Subpoenas Ursula Meese's Job Records. It now develops that Independent Counsel James McKay is investigating Mrs. Meese's $40,000 a year job with the Multiple Sclerosis Society. According to sources familiar with McKay's inquiry, the independent counsel has been trying to determine whether the Meeses' close friend, E. Bob Wallach, in effect helped supplement the Meeses' income by recommending Ursula Meese for the jobs.
