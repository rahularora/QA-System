Virginia's joint celebration Monday of the birthdays of two Confederate generals and a black civil rights leader on Lee Jackson King Day is the perfect combination of diversity, says the man responsible for the merger. Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who as a state senator five years ago pushed through the bill making Martin Luther King Jr. Day a Virginia holiday, says he doesn't find it ironic that King shares the holiday with Virginia natives Robert E. Lee and Thomas Stonewall Jackson.

In 1983, after considerable debate, Congress created a holiday to honor King on the third Monday in January, around his Jan. 15 birthday. Martin Luther King Jr. Day, first celebrated nationally in 1986, is an official state holiday in some form in most states Idaho is about to become the 47th. Wyoming, which calls itself the Equality State because it was the first to give women the vote, had legislators who supported a holiday commemorating equal rights but didn't want it in King's name.

His first blow against racism came when he led a year long bocott of segregated buses in Montgomery, Ala. From there he established the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to set the pace of working peacefully for equal rights for blacks.

King's widow, Coretta Scott King, delivered her annual State of the Dream speech to 1,200 people crammed into Atlanta's historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King and his father were co pastors. She urged President elect George Bush to hold true to his call for a kinder, gentler nation by imposing strict sanctions against South Africa and providing direct financial support to black South Africans who bear the brunt of suffering in that troubled land. Mrs. King urged Bush to put behind the politics of the past by addressing several issues during his term of office: affordable housing, a stepped up war on drugs and racial violence and the appointment of federal judges who are as tough on discrimination as they are on street crimes.
