A striped shellfish now clogging water system pipelines and threatening the ecological balance of the Great Lakes could make its way to rivers around the country in as little as five years, scientists say. The rapidly producing zebra mussels could pose a significant problem for manufacturing plants, many of which have miles of pipes that draw cooling water, the experts warn. The mussels eventually will attach themselves to the insides of pipes supplying factories and municipal water plants, in some cases restricting flow, in the Allegheny, Ohio and Monongahela rivers, said Thomas Nalepa, a biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

EDITOR'S NOTE They are alien creatures of the deep, unknown in the waters of the United States until a few years ago. They can cut off the water supply of cities, ruin boat engines, and scientists worry that they will upset the aquatic food chain. The invasion of the zebra mussels, which began in the Great Lakes, is expected to spread to waterways across the land.

Microscopic at birth, the tiny invaders ride the currents of the Great Lakes searching for a home along the rocky lake bottom, or better yet, on a man made structure. Life is easy with few natural predators and plenty of solid structures to attach their hairlike tentacles. And laying 30,000 eggs a year does more than just keep the family heritage going.

The zebra mussel, native to Europe, was discovered in the Great Lakes in the 1980s; biologists believe they arrived in the ballast of European freighters that moved in the lakes. The mussel grows to about thumbnail size, and breeds profusely, up to concentrations of nearly a million per square meter of surface.

For public water systems, controlling the mussels is a matter of applying chlorine, ozone or other disinfectants at the mouth of the intake pipe rather than waiting until the water is inside the plant, say scientists and plant operators like LePage who have already faced the problem. Power plants have a different problem, because officials are reluctant to let them put chlorine or other disinfectants in cooling water discharged back to the lake, Henderson said.

Zebra mussels accidentally imported to the Great Lakes in the last four years are threatening commercial and sport fishing and forcing cities and industries into costly measures to protect water supplies. The 2 inch long mollusk, first dropped off an ocean going freighter in Lake St. Clair outside Detroit, has spread through Lake Erie and a colony was found in Lake Michigan near Green Bay, Wis., said Michael Donahue, executive director of the Great Lakes Commission, headquartered in Ann Arbor, Mich. Intake pipes for industrial plants and municipal water systems are among favorite breeding grounds for the greenish striped mussel. Monroe, Mich., just south of Detroit, is designing a system to bathe the mouth of its intake system with ozone infused water in hopes of killing the mussels' larvae, but there is very little that apparently can be done to stem the surge of the mussels.

The zebra mussel is one of many exotic species invading U.S. waters, and a broad strategy is needed to keep them from wreaking economic and environmental havoc, experts said Tuesday. The river ruffe, spiny water flea and tube nosed goby soon may become as familiar to the Great Lakes as the zebra mussel, witnesses said at a hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on Environmental Protection. Meanwhile, the asiatic clam, Japanese seaweed and the red tide are damaging shellfish and marine industries along the ocean coasts.

A Canadian delivery of sleet and ice sledded into the deep South on Monday in a winter preview that cracked century old temperature records across the Midwest and clogged the Missouri River with a 75 mile ice jam. The bitter weather closed schools from Mississippi to Michigan, and forecasters said no change was in sight. The cold is being caused by a horseshoe shaped flow of air that follows the West Coast up to Alaska, chills out and plunges down through Canada into the East and Midwest.

Although the new species are controlled by predators in their original homes, many lack predators in the lakes, and given an adequate food supply and appropriate life support systems, ... they can become a serious threat if they outcompete or destroy valuable native species, the commission said.

Boren, said Venter leads safari tours in South Africa and came to the United States to see if he could drum up business. Boren said Venter did not sell the skin but was merely using it as collateral while he arranged the sale of other, legally imported skins.

Nearly 20 years after the Cuyahoga River last caught fire, officials say Lake Erie and its tributaries are cleaner than they have been in decades. Scores of Lake Erie beaches will be open in Ohio this year, and more than 25 million walleye thrive in Erie's waters. Boating has become so popular that many marinas in the Toledo area are running out of dock space.

A few decades ago, Lake Erie had only three clean beaches, and fish were dying at a rapid rate. An oil slick on the Cuyahoga caught fire June 22, 1969. The dramatic improvement has been caused primarily by a decrease in phosphates and other nutrients that caused algae to flourish in Lake Erie, using up oxygen and killing fish, said Laura Fay, a research associate for the Center for Lake Erie Area Research.

The sudden spate of attacks on tourists in the Masai Mara, east of Tsavo, earlier this year was unprecedented for Kenya and led to increased security. Operators are insisting on a minimum of two vehicles travelling together on particular game drives in the Mara's remoter areas. But travellers to Tsavo unlike the Mara, Tsavo is controlled by the Kenya Wildlife Service have faced no difficulties.

The Canadian government proposed measures to reduce high Great Lakes water levels that are causing heavy damage to shoreline property in the U.S. and Canada. The proposals include removal of landfill in the Niagara River, which links Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Environment Minister Tom McMillan also proposed an increased flow of water from Lake Erie through the Black Rock Canal, which runs along the U.S. shore of the upper Niagara River.

A toxic chemical spill snaking its way toward Lake Erie on Thursday forced the evacuation of hundreds of people and fouled drinking water for at least 22,000 along the Sandusky River. At least three people were treated for injuries after an estimated 100,000 gallons of toluene, an octane enhancer, spilled Wednesday from a ruptured Sun Co. pipeline south of here. Five hundred people, including 300 residents of Old Fort, 10 miles to the south, were evacuated Wednesday and Thursday because of the fumes.

Ron Refsnider, a staff biologist for the federal Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service in Minneapolis, says several states have laws governing mussel shells, although they are inconsistent and vary widely. Refsnider says it's unlikely the agency will impose quotas or restrict shelling, even though 25 species of mussels are on the endangered list and 75 species are candidates. If anything regarding the threat to mussels is overstated, Refsnider says, it's the ease of solving the problem.

Such fish as bass and lake trout would flourish in Michigan, and the Great Lakes' shipping season would lengthen if the greenhouse effect warms the Earth a few degrees, a major federal study says. The ice season on Lake Superior would be shortened by one month to three months, and on Lake Erie by two mohths to three months, increasing shipping seasons there, said an unreleased Environmental Protection Agency study that is to be submitted to the Congress in December. The Associated Press obtained a draft of a summary of the effects of global warming, which is caused by a growing concentration of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.

ONE OF the most bitterly fought battles between environmentalists and miners enters a new phase next month when work re starts on the Dollars 20m development of Flambeau Mining's copper project in Wisconsin. The hugely rich but relatively small deposit, now owned by RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, was first found in 1968 but it was not until last year that all the permits were in place for development which began in August. Then environmental researchers successfully applied to a US judge for work to be halted because they said purple warty back mussels and other threatened or endangered species were found in the Flambeau River about a mile from where the mining company plans a drain pipe outlet.

Kennecott Corporation, now an RTZ subsidiary, has owned the deposit for 20 years and persevered because it is exceptionally rich. The ore contains 10.5 per cent of copper whereas most miners would be happy with 2 or 3 per cent. Unfortunately, there is only about 1.9m tonnes of ore. As this will be dug out at the rate of 320,000 tonnes a year, the mine will have a life of only six years.
