Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, oil rich leader of the tiny Pacific sultanate of Brunei, retained Fortune's top title for the fourth straight year with an estimated worth of $25 billion, unchanged from 1989. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and clan, a focus of the Persian Gulf crisis, ranked second with assets worth $18 billion, also unchanged from last year.

Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and clan, a focus of the Persian Gulf crisis, ranked second with assets worth $18 billion, also unchanged from last year. Fortune spokeswoman Emma Dockendorff said those estimates were based partly on oil prices in mid July, when one barrel of crude fetched about $18.

The Mars candy bar clan is worth $12.5 billion, surpassing the Newhouse publishing dynasty as the richest family in America, Fortune magazine reports. If Fortune's estimate is correct, the worth of the Marses could buy about 25 billion regular size Snickers bars, which if laid end to end would circle the planet Mars nearly 32 times. The magazine's calculation is more than any previous estimate of the wealth of the secretive family, which shuns publicity about itself and its candy bar company, maker of Snickers and M&amp;Ms. Mars's assets are often underestimated because the company is as loose with information as its McLean, Va., neighbor, the CIA, Fortune said Wednesday in an advance press release about its 1988 Billionaires List, to be carried in the Sept. 12 issue available on newsstands next Monday.

The museum's already fine Cezanne collection will also be markedly enhanced by the addition of a grand and richly painted L'Estaque landscape and of a powerfully composed and vigorously painted still life.

Queen Elizabeth II and her family got a pay increase in Tuesday's annual budget of 4.6 percent, which was lower than inflation but still means they will cost the taxpayers $10.6 million. The increase of 273,000 pounds ($466,800) brought the total to 6,195,300 pounds ($10,594,000), and was too much for some Labor Party legislators whatever its relation to the cost of living. For the royal family, it looks as though Christmas has come early, Labor member Max Madden said in the House of Commons.

Six of the 10 richest people in the world are Japanese but the United States still leads the world in the total number of billionaires, according to estimates compiled by Forbes magazine. For the third year running, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi led Forbes' list of private billionaires even though his wealth wasn't quite as much as it had been 12 months earlier. Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, has a personal net worth of at least $15 billion, over $3 billion less than estimated last summer due mainly to a rise in the dollar against other major currencies, Forbes said Sunday.

The Sultan of Brunei, one of the world's wealthiest men, has agreed to buy the legendary Beverly Hills Hotel from oil tycoon Marvin Davis for more than $200 million, hotel sources said.

Queen Elizabeth II, who served in the wartime Auxiliary Territorial Service and whose Buckingham Palace home was bombed in 1940, will visit The Blitz Experience Thursday when she officially opens the redeveloped museum. The museum arose from a government decision in March 1917 to collect and display material from World War I. It is housed appropriately, some say in the building that was the 19th century mental hospital known as Bedlam.

Besides little tins labeled Queen Mary's Comforts for the Troops from World War I needles and cotton, cigarettes and candy there are guns and gas masks, tanks and two man submarines, uniforms and medals, fighter planes suspended from the ceiling, 100,000 books and the world's best war art collection of 12,000 paintings and drawings.

So European Silver: The Thyssen Bornemisza Collection (Vendome, 311 pages, $95) by Hannelore Mueller is the place to look if you want to see how a table setting really ought to be. Perhaps the greatest of the Thyssen treasures is a rococo traveling service of 53 gilded silver items made in Augsburg around 1750. More humble in its fabulous way is a 17th century tortoise flask, also from Augsburg.

BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) A meeting was held at the Grand People's Study House in Pyongyang on June 20 to introduce the book Korea I Saw Again 40 Years After written by Cuban woman lawyer Candelaria Rodriguez. In his speech at the meeting, Kim Chin pom, vice chairman of the Committee for Cultural Relations With Foreign Countries, said that Cuban woman lawyer, the author of the book Korea I saw Again 40 Years After , impressively wrote what she saw, heard and felt during her revisit to Korea 40 years after she visited Korea as a member of an international fact finding team during the fatherland liberation war (June 1950 July 1953) and exposed to the world people the bestial atrocities committed by the U.S. imperialist aggressors against the Korean people. He expressed the hope that this book would help the revolutionary people of the world to have a clearer understanding of the validity and invincible vitality of the socialist cause for its rich, truthful and revolutionary contents and for its diversified, concise and vivid method of expression.

When Donald Trump bought the Plaza Hotel for roughly $400 million this year, the judgment of many real estate observers was that he paid too much. Industry sources, however, say Mr. Trump already has received and rejected an offer for the Plaza that would have net him a 50% profit. The sultan of Brunei, reputedly the world's richest person, recently offered to buy it for a little more than $500 million.
