Two centuries after the United States was founded as a largely agricultural nation, nearly nine tenths of the population growth is occurring in metropolitan areas, the Census Bureau reports. Almost half of all Americans reside in just 37 major urban areas, the bureau said Thursday in a new analysis of the patterns of growth. And the metropolitan share of the population is growing faster than that in rural areas.

The rural renaissance reported in the 1970s when small towns and rural areas were growing seems to have ended, with increases in cities and suburbs now well in the lead.

The rural renaissance reported in the 1970s when small towns and rural areas were growing seems to have ended, with increases in cities and suburbs now well in the lead. The census study found that about 86 percent of the nation's population growth since 1980 has occurred in the 282 officially designated metropolitan areas across the country.

A new study concludes that skewing the Census Bureau's national headcount, as has been proposed in various forms by lawmakers and special interest groups, would make little difference in the allocation of House seats. Population shifts since 1980 are expected to result in the shift of 18 or more seats, various experts agree. But even combining the various suggested adjustments would shift a maximum of just four additional seats among California, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Minnesota, population analyst William P. O'Hare reports.

A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by 42 congressmen and three states seeking to block the counting of illegal aliens in the 1990 census, in part because they could not prove they will lose seats in Congress by reapportionment. The plaintiffs said they feared states with more illegal aliens would get a disproportionate number of House seats and electoral votes, thus diminishing the political power of states with fewer illegal aliens. The Census Bureau argued it is constitutionally obligated to count everyone, including illegal aliens, for congressional apportionment and has done so since the first census in 1790.

The Census Bureau estimated a national count of just under 246 million, including 29.3 million in California, 17.6 million in New York, 16.8 million in Texas and 12.8 million in Florida. Wyoming was last, at just under 450,000, passed by Alaska, which had the smallest population in 1980 but grew to almost 546,000 in 1990.

With political strength following population, new 1990 Census projections give California, Texas and Florida a rosy outlook. California would jump to 50 members of the House, a gain of five, according to an analysis by the Library of Congress. David C. Huckabee of the Library's Congressional Research Service recalculated the House distribution based on the new Census Bureau projections of populations in 1990.

David C. Huckabee of the Library's Congressional Research Service recalculated the House distribution based on the new Census Bureau projections of populations in 1990. The estimates were released Thursday. Huckabee cautioned, however, that his calculation is based on estimates, and a very small change in population can shift a House seat from one state to another.

The estimates were released Thursday. Huckabee cautioned, however, that his calculation is based on estimates, and a very small change in population can shift a House seat from one state to another. In 1970, for example, a difference of fewer than 300 people gave Oklahoma rather than Connecticut an additional House seat, he said.

The nation grew to 249.6 million people in the 1980s as more Americans left the industrial and agricultural heartlands for the South and West. The Census Bureau's first final figures from the 1990 census, released Wednesday, showed the pull of the Sun Belt remained strong, despite efforts by the industrial North to promote growth and the collapse during the 1980s of the oil and savings and loan industries two mainstays of the Southern and Western states. The census figures are used to adjust the number of representatives each state sends to Congress so that political clout is in line with population.

The addition of 3.8 million people to the preliminary total released this summer reflects 2.9 million residents the bureau missed the first time as well as the anticipated 922,819 military and other federal employees and dependents overseas. Under the Constitution, the new headcount will result in a shift of 19 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. California is the big winner, adding seven seats to give it 52 representatives, or nearly 12% of all the seats in the 435 member House.

California emerges from the 1990 census as a political behemoth, with 52 House seats, a population bigger than Canada's and 20 percent of the electoral votes needed to be elected president. Add together the congressional representation of 21 states and they still will total fewer than the delegation from California, which swells by seven in 1992, the result of a 26 percent surge in population in the last 10 years.

Armed with batteries of computers and brigades of lawyers, Republicans and Democrats are skirmishing for control of the political shakeup that offers the GOP its once in a decade opportunity to dent Democratic control of Congress. If we want to be competitive in the House, we have to get a good shake on redistricting, said Charles Black, the political consultant who is chairman of the Republican National Committee's advisory committee on redistricting. Right now, given the strength of incumbency, there are only two times you get a chance to pick up any congressional seats, he said.

RACIAL differences in the timing of first births are widening, two University of Pennsylvania demographers find. Drawing on birth and other records published since 1979, Renbao Chen and S. Philip Morgan determine that from 1980 to 1987 white women under 30 years old continued an earlier trend toward postponing their first birth, while white women over 30 began showing slightly higher rates of first births than over 30 women of earlier decades, clearly seeking to catch up on postponed fertility. Nonwhite women blacks, Asians and others also tended to have their first children at somewhat later ages than nonwhite women in earlier years.

Nonwhite women blacks, Asians and others also tended to have their first children at somewhat later ages than nonwhite women in earlier years. But at every age from the teens on, blacks and other nonwhites were far more likely to be having their first birth than were white women of the same age. For example, in 1987 a 20 year old nonwhite woman was almost twice as likely to have her first child in the following year as was a 20 year old white woman, while a 25 year old nonwhite woman was about 1 1/2 times more likely to be having her first child than her white counterpart.

The densely settled Northeast has become the nation's least populated region, falling behind the West for the first time, the Census Bureau reported Thursday. The bureau also projected that Texas will surpass New York for second place behind California in population by 1995. And between now and the year 2000, half of all U.S. population growth will occur in just three states: California, Texas and Florida, the report said.

And between now and the year 2000, half of all U.S. population growth will occur in just three states: California, Texas and Florida, the report said. The projections are based on assumptions about trends in births, deaths, immigration and movement within the country, bureau demographer Signe Wetrogen explained.

Population shifts to the South and West in recent years have drawn away many people in the prime ages of 18 to 24, so the (Northeast) region is left with more older people, and it's left without anybody to have more kids, she said.

American military personnel stationed overseas will be counted in the 1990 census, but the House on Tuesday blocked a related move to bar the counting of illegal aliens. The decision to include military personnel in the count was announced by the Commerce Department at the start of a hearing on a bill to require the action. According to Tuesday's announcement, the Census Bureau will work with the Pentagon to count the 1.2 million to 1.6 million military and civilian Defense Department workers overseas.

This sort of intelligence is solid gold to market researchers, developers and planners who are forever seeking better ways of predicting and charting state or regional population growth. Migration data is vital in the local growth equation because what sets the growth rate of one area apart from another is almost entirely the movement of people.

The findings are based on two Census Bureau projects: a post enumeration survey conducted in selected areas after the 1990 census and a demographic analysis of state, local and federal administrative records. The census count for 1990 is 248,709,873 nationwide. According to the post enumeration figures, however, the census count should be somewhere between 252,982,000 and 254,989,000.

The Bureau counted 7.033 million people in the city. The Department of City Planning estimates 8 million people live in the city. It is statistically stunning and demographically absurd for the Census Bureau to claim that a city whose resident birth rate has risen by at least 23 percent and which has welcomed more than 800,000 legal immigrants to its shores during the past decade has actually lost population, the mayor said.

The city was given 15 business days to review the Bureau's 1990 preliminary figures. It did so by analyzing data from the city, Con Edison and the New York Telephone Co., as well as consulting surveys, atlases and aerial photographs.

The bureau has said it would take 10 days to review the city's challenge. In a three block area in one section of Queens, the city counted 567 housing units in what it said was a neighborhood of one and two family homes; the Census Bureau counted zero units.

Neighborhoods with minority populations, in general, tended to be undercounted by the bureau, said Richard Schaffer, director of the Department of City Planning and chairman of the City Planning Commission.

Dinkins said the 1980 undercount, put by the Census Bureau at 450,000, cost New York City some $675 million in federal aid during the ensuing 10 years.
