Director Ingmar Bergman is turning 70, having reached what he calls the twilight of his career but basking in a run of theater successes. Recuperating from a hip operation, Bergman is quietly celebrating his July 14 birthday at his retreat at Faro, a rugged island of beaches and pine trees in the Baltic Sea, with some of his eight children and his fifth wife, Ingrid. Bergman, whose films probed emotions and relationships rarely touched by others, says he has made his last movie.

The blond giant stood tentatively on the stage of the Place des Artes theater, seemingly amazed at the standing ovation accorded him by the packed audience. Max Von Sydow had come to the Montreal World Film Festival for a tribute to his 30 year career that has brought distinction to movies on both sides of the Atlantic. The program included clips from two widely divergent films: Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring (1959) and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986).

The program included clips from two widely divergent films: Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring (1959) and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986). A dialogue with the actor was followed by a screening of the Danish made Pelle the Conqueror, which drew the Motion Picture Academy's best foreign language film Oscar of 1988 as well as a nomination as best actor for Von Sydow.

Nothing is quite what it should be in the world created by director Ingmar Bergman for his startling, violent and often mesmerizing production of Hamlet which arrived this week at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for an eight performance run. In Bergman's unnerving creation for the Royal Dramatic Theater of Sweden, Denmark becomes an environment of decay, sexual excess, psychotic behavior and ultimately needless slaughter carried out to ear bursting pop music and the whir of minicams and tape recorders. Elsinore has been transformed into a castle of lost souls where a drunken king and queen have sex in public while the court titters and applauds, Polonius preaches like a stuffy British barrister, Ophelia becomes a disheveled flower child gone mad, the Gravedigger turns into an existential comic waiting for Godot and Fortinbras storms the stage as a black bereted guerrilla leader.

A century on, Bergman's art is rooted in scenes close to Ibsen: moral integrity; a sense of sin powerfully visualised; individual expression within claustrophobic relationships; the meeting of dream and reality.

Since the success of Pelle the Conqueror, an Oscar winner in 1989 for best foreign film, Von Sydow thinks he has a new image in the United States.

Other contributions have included Jan Troell's The Emigrants and The New Land (about Swedish farmers in Minnesota), Bo Wilderberg's Elvira Madigan and last year's Academy Award winner, Babette's Feast.

Nowadays, producers are more apt to drop the subplot involving the agents and friends of Hamlet's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, a trend which in itself inspired a whole, much applauded play by British dramatist Tom Stoppard about two characters who find they do not exist outside the play. In 1987, Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's acclaimed production with his Royal Dramatic Theater of Stockholm had a week long run in Britain, and in September Russian director Yuri Lyubimov will stage Hamlet with a British company at the Leicester Haymarket Theater. Drawn from Scandinavian legend, Hamlet is about a prince who comes home from university to discover that his father has been murdered by his brother who has usurped the throne and married the queen he has widowed.

<P> Over in Stockholm, Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman is suing a tabloid for symbolic damages of one crown (15 cents), saying it broke the copyright to his memoirs. The film director and his publishers took the evening newspaper Aftonbladet to court this week, charging that it published an article based on unedited material from his biography, Laterna Magica, before it was published in 1987. Aftonbladet's editor, Thorbjorn Larsson, denied the charge, saying the article was based on interviews, books and television programs.ALEENE MacMINN </P>

The most delectable movie of the holiday season is a simple little confection from John Hughes about a 10 year old who's left behind by accident when his parents and multitude of siblings head off for a Christmas vacation in Paris. Home Alone is endearing, engaging and a lot of fun, once you suspend disbelief and buy into Hughes' idiotic premise. And one main reason for the film's success is Macaulay Culkin, the talented young actor who plays Kevin, the boy who finds paradise in being at home by himself and who gets to defend the castle against all intruders.

The play, with an all female cast, has received invitations so far from Tokyo and Denmark, theater spokesman Leif Ostman said Thursday.

If the ultimate tragedy eludes him, he gives the character a degree of credibility. Miss Leslie is a surprise. She seemed strangely muted on stage, unable to project the unbearable sadness of a woman overwhelmed by life.

Miss Leslie is a surprise. She seemed strangely muted on stage, unable to project the unbearable sadness of a woman overwhelmed by life. That desperation comes across in the television version and even acquires a delicate, other worldly character.

She seemed strangely muted on stage, unable to project the unbearable sadness of a woman overwhelmed by life. That desperation comes across in the television version and even acquires a delicate, other worldly character. Spacey and Gallagher were the strongest actors on stage and their strengths still are evident here.

That desperation comes across in the television version and even acquires a delicate, other worldly character. Spacey and Gallagher were the strongest actors on stage and their strengths still are evident here. Spacey is particularly moving as the bitter son who realizes he has failed and can do nothing about it.

This year is the centennial of O'Neill's birth and Long Day's Journey Into Night will be very much a part of worldwide festivities.

The Broadway production and cast will alternate performances with Ah, Wilderness!, O'Neill's only comedy. Ah, Wilderness! represents a sunny, innocent family life that O'Neill wished for but never found.

represents a sunny, innocent family life that O'Neill wished for but never found. Long Day's Journey was the other side of his psyche. Miller's television production explores it with uncommon and unnerving grace.

If Plymouth's Stephen Sondheim is less appealing than Leicester's, the fact is that A Little Night Music is in itself a less enticing proposition than Merrily We Roll Along. It came some nine years earlier in the Sondheim oeuvre, and the idea of setting Ingmar Bergman's romantic film comedy Smiles of a Summer Night to waltz time got a brittle realisation, one that needs all the stage help it can get. Roger Redfarn's Plymouth production has its merits.

Roger Redfarn's Plymouth production has its merits. There are pretty sets by Martyn Bainbridge: a decayed proscenium arch, trellises, a large mock rococo fresco, shadowy trees outside Grandmamma's chateau (far too many bright stars, though, for a midnight sun night).

There are pretty sets by Martyn Bainbridge: a decayed proscenium arch, trellises, a large mock rococo fresco, shadowy trees outside Grandmamma's chateau (far too many bright stars, though, for a midnight sun night). Reduced to two pianos and a cello, all commendably expert, the score sounds brittler than ever pastiche operetta, even G&amp;S, with ingenious rhymes over mildly queasy waltz harmonies.

One misses the original string ensemble. The one surefire number, 'Send in the Clowns', comes near the end; there is nothing so memorably apt and infectious as 'Old Friends', midstream in Merrily We Roll Along.

The real trouble, however, lies with the adaptation (by Hugh Wheeler and Sondheim). In Bergman's comedy, quite naturalistic and slightly cruel, a weary, unglamorous lawyer, with a still virgin bride of 11 months, competed with an icily formidable Count for the favours of a famous actress (the irreplaceable Eva Dahlbeck).

In the musical the Count is only a blustering dunderhead and the equally icy Countess a lachrymose Wronged Wife; the lawyer becomes a mature romantic hero attractively played here by Gary Raymond, sung at variable pitch.
