The widow of investor publisher John Hay Whitney will offer a Renoir from the couple's collection for sale for an estimated $40 million to $50 million, Sotheby's auction house said Tuesday. Pierre Auguste Renoir's 1876 artwork, acclaimed for its light, shadow and movement, depicts the Moulin de la Galette, a French outdoor dance hall in Montmartre frequented by avant garde writers, painters and actors. It shows a model named Estelle siting at a table with three of Renoir's friends, including biographer Georges Rivere, who later described the painting as a page of history, a precious moment of Paris life depicted with rigorous examination.

U.S. auction houses sold more than $1.5 billion worth of art last year and chalked up their best selling season ever thanks to a broader, more educated audience, art dealers said. Two Pablo Picasso paintings sold for more than $40 million each to become the third and fourth most expensive paintings ever, but the not so wealthy art lover also contributed to the record sales by buying works that cost thousands rather than than millions. When the final bang of the gavel sounded on U.S. art auction sales for the season, the total came to $1.53 billion, nearly double last year's total, Leonard's Annual Price Index of Art Auctions reported this week.

Pablo Picasso would have gotten a kick out of seeing his self portrait sell for $47.85 million to become the second most expensive art work ever auctioned, his daughter said. Yo Picasso, painted 88 years ago when the artist was 20, was last sold in 1981 for $5.5 million. Its price Tuesday night at Sotheby's was more than twice its pre sale estimate and was second only to Vincent Van Gogh's Irises, which sold for $53.9 million in 1987.

A Picasso self portrait painted in 1901 sold for $47.85 million Tuesday, a record for the artist and the second highest price ever paid for a single artwork at auction. The price paid at Sotheby's for Yo Picasso, painted when the artist was 20 years old, was more than twice its pre sale estimate and $9.4 million more than the previous record for the Spanish artist. It's in another stratosphere, but it's because there's a lot of cash around, Paloma Picasso, the artist's daughter who attended the auction, said when asked if she thought the bidding had gotten out of hand.

These days, it seems, if you've got something to sell there's a buyer in Japan, no matter how big the price tag. So it's hardly surprising that Japanese collectors of Western art are on a spending spree. But many insiders in the art world, both at home and abroad, are disturbed by the trend.

Japanese speculators are scouring the art world for the best money can buy, catapulting prices upward with a series of audacious bids at auction houses in New York and London. Many museums and smaller galleries are dismayed, saying they can't compete. This new buying spree is being led by real estate speculators and bootstrap entrepreneurs such as Yasumichi Morishita, a Japanese moneylender who made his fortune with high interest loans and has a reputation as an aggressive and indiscriminate buyer of art.

Nowhere is this as evident as in the market for Impressionist and modern paintings, where Japanese dealers and collectors are snapping up about 40 percent to 50 percent of total sales at London based Christie's and Sotheby's auction houses, in some cases, dealers say, with little regard for quality and price. The renewed Japanese appetite for Western art became evident in 1987 when Yasuda Marine and Fire Insurance Co. paid $39.9 million for Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers at the time the world's most expensive painting. Western collectors still are able to set art market benchmarks, such as the $53.9 million sale of Vincent van Gogh's 1889 Irises in 1987 to Australian tycoon Alan Bond now the world record.

Thousands of students bicycled to major media and government offices today to protest censorship, and officials announced their first policy change in response to demands made in nearly a month of pro democracy protests. The Ministry of Supervision said today that it would allow more open news reporting of corruption cases, saying the move was prompted by the recent demands of Beijing university students to crack down on corruption. Today's protest by more than 5,000 students came a day after a petition signed by more than 1,000 Chinese journalists seeking press freedom in this Communist nation was delivered to government officials.

The sale of Vincent van Gogh's Irises for a record $53.9 million two years ago was considered a loud vote of confidence in an art market still under the cloud of Wall Street's Black Monday. But two years later the world's most expensive painting is sitting in a vault, and the Irises deal is looking wilted. It turns out that Sotheby's lent Australian tycoon Alan Bond $27 million to buy the 1889 painting; that as collateral Bond posted the picture he was going to buy; that Bond has not paid off the loan; that Sotheby's, not Bond, now has the painting; that Bond, reportedly $5 billion in debt, apparently wants to sell the painting, or at least his share of it.
