CSO [Text] India is in the agonising process of an evaluation whether the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, should call off or postpone his proposed visit to the United States, sometime in summer. The Ministry of External Affairs itself is sharply divided on the issue with one section strongly advocating the visit, while the other group pleads that in the vitiated atmosphere nothing tangible will emerge, which would help consolidate the ties between the two countries and remove growing misunderstandings on a host of issues.

Narasimha Rao, should call off or postpone his proposed visit to the United States, sometime in summer. The Ministry of External Affairs itself is sharply divided on the issue with one section strongly advocating the visit, while the other group pleads that in the vitiated atmosphere nothing tangible will emerge, which would help consolidate the ties between the two countries and remove growing misunderstandings on a host of issues. If one were to analyse the tone and tenor of recent remarks by the American President, Mr Bill Clinton, and his aides, it is evident that they do not see India requiring any high level attention.

The Ministry of External Affairs itself is sharply divided on the issue with one section strongly advocating the visit, while the other group pleads that in the vitiated atmosphere nothing tangible will emerge, which would help consolidate the ties between the two countries and remove growing misunderstandings on a host of issues. If one were to analyse the tone and tenor of recent remarks by the American President, Mr Bill Clinton, and his aides, it is evident that they do not see India requiring any high level attention. Probably, this has been the trend for well over two decades.

If one were to analyse the tone and tenor of recent remarks by the American President, Mr Bill Clinton, and his aides, it is evident that they do not see India requiring any high level attention. Probably, this has been the trend for well over two decades. No American President visited India since Mr Jimmy Carter, nor for that matter has any Secretary of State come in the past decade.

BFN <F P=106> [Editorial: China's Goodwill Gesture ] </F> [Text] The Chinese ambassador, Mr Cheng Ruisheng's statement, that Beijing is soon likely to officially recognise Sikkim's merger with India, is further good tidings for New Delhi and indicates that India can now look forward to the dividends of last year's agreement which marked a departure from past hostility between the two countries. Ever since Indira Gandhi's decision to make the Protectorate of Sikkim a State of the Republic in 1975, Beijing has steadfastly questioned the legality of the annexation. More than the technicality of the Himalayan kingdom's merger with India and whether or not a sovereign nation had been subjugated, Beijing was bothered by the disappearance of a buffer between India and China.

It is possible that the Chinese political leadership remained unhappy with the merger, but it refrained from striking public postures on the issue. Two factors have since contributed to the removal of doubts in Beijing about India's motives behind granting Sikkim statehood: First, the Prime Minister's visit to China last year which led to the Sino Indian agreement on maintaining peace and tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control; and, second, China's interest in forging a regional front to prevent the U.S. from meddling in Asian affairs.

Two factors have since contributed to the removal of doubts in Beijing about India's motives behind granting Sikkim statehood: First, the Prime Minister's visit to China last year which led to the Sino Indian agreement on maintaining peace and tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control; and, second, China's interest in forging a regional front to prevent the U.S. from meddling in Asian affairs. Both the factors have contributed towards an upswing in Sino Indian relations to the detriment of America's hegemonistic designs in the region, an added spinoff being the weakening of the Pakistan China axis. True, Beijing's official recognition of Sikkim's merger will not necessarily mean the removal of all irritants in Sino Indian relations; neither should it be seen as indicative of a smooth road to solving the vexatious border dispute.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today accused the United States and Pakistan of creating obstacles in implementing the accord that provides for the withdrawal of Red Army troops from Afghanistan. Pakistan and the United States find it hard to accept new approaches to international affairs, Gorbachev said at a ceremony where he received a peace prize named for former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Their actions appear to indicate that they would like us to rescind those accords, even though the grave consequences of that are obvious, Gorbachev said on the second day of his three day state visit to India.
