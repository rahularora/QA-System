But the flow of funds and an apology from the emperor are not likely to appease a Chinese people raised on horrific tales of the 'burn all, loot all, kill all' policies of the Japanese military during the second world war. Detailing the brutality of that period has served the Communist party's interests as it highlights the 'heroic' role of revolutionary era soldiers, one of whom, Deng Xiaoping, is now an emperor himself in everything but name. In deference to the Japanese emperor, Beijing has barred protests by private groups seeking war compensation from Japan and taken much newspaper space to explain the new, non political role of Akihito.

The previous constitution gave Hirohito nominal powers, and the wartime government asserted it was acting in his name. The constitution also omits all references to the emperor's special relationship with the gods of Shinto, Japan's indigenous religion, which angers some conservatives. Japan's monarchy can trace its history to at least the 8th century, and by legend until the 6th century B.C.

Emperor Akihito today became the first Japanese monarch to pay tribute at a monument to the 70,000 people who died in the atomic bomb blast that devastated Nagasaki 45 years ago. A steady rain fell as Akihito, accompanied by Empress Michiko, bowed deeply and placed a bouquet of white flowers on a dark granite cenotaph before the monument. Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima led Akihito to the site.

Emperor Akihito has long lived in the shadow of his father, the late Emperor Hirohito, and the memories of Japan's headlong march into the Pacific War that Hirohito's name evoked. But now that Akihito has assumed the throne left by his father's death, many Japanese are looking to him as the symbol of a new age that of the generation who experienced war as children and rebuilt the nation in peace. Akihito was 11 at the end of World War II, which Japanese militarists had urged the nation into in the name of his father.

The woman, Michiko Shoda, was the daughter of one of the nation's wealthiest businessmen, but their marriage in 1959 sent shock waves through Japan's former nobility. To the rest of the nation, however, the wedding was welcomed as none before. About 500,000 people lined the streets for a chance to see Akihito and Michiko in their horse drawn carriage during a parade after the ceremony.

The royal couple again broke with tradition by raising their own children, a decision prompted in part by Akihito's desire to have the family life he was denied as a child, according to Minoru Hamao, a former imperial chamberlain.

Emperor Akihito on Friday completed a centuries old ceremony signifying his accession to the world's oldest hereditary throne while protests were held against the monarchy and the high cost of the rite. The Shinto ceremony, symbolizing communion with the sun goddess, has been performed by most of Japan's emperors since at least the 7th century, and in the past was believed to give monarchs their status as living god. But demonstrators across the country criticized the ritual as a violation of the Japanese constitution's separation of church and state and questioned the use of nearly $17 million in tax money on the ceremony.

The monarchy dates to the 6th or 7th century, but the Japanese public associates it most closely with Hirohito's 60 year reign. In that period, Japan waged expansionist wars in the name of the emperor, suffered a crushing defeat and foreign occupation, then rose to become an economic superpower. Akihito, 56, became emperor immediately after his father's death, but his formal enthronement awaited a year of mourning and the growing of sacred rice for a coronation rite.

BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO Japanese Ambassador to the United States Takakazu Kuriyama said Wednesday [25 May] Japan needs to take steps to significantly reduce its current account surplus and implement a market opening package to successfully conclude the trade framework talks with the U.S. Kuriyama, who is currently in Japan to prepare for the upcoming U.S. visit by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, made the remarks at a press conference at the Foreign Ministry. He said Japan and the U.S. agreed Tuesday to get the deadlocked framework talks back on track because both sides shared the view that it is undesirable to keep tense economic and trade relations drifting since that would hurt overall bilateral relations. Tokyo and Washington also reached the accord because it deepened understanding about each other's positions on the trade negotiations, he said.

For Japan, which normalized relations with South Korea in 1965, the statements marked a breakthrough in acknowledging the suffering it inflicted during its stifling 1910 1945 rule of Korea.

Emperor Akihito today began the most controversial ceremony in his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne, a communion with the mythical sun goddess from whom legend says the imperial line descended. The Shinto rite has been performed by most of Japan's monarchs since at least the seventh century, and in the past was believed to give monarchs their status as living gods. But protests were held across the country against the state funded rite, which has been criticized by many Japanese as violating the constitution's separation of church and state.

Japan's imperial family and top government officials marked the first anniversary Sunday of Emperor Hirohito's death with ceremonies at the Imperial Palace and the late monarch's tomb. The anniversary ended an official one year mourning period for the royal household, permitting in the coming months the marriage of a prince and the elaborate coronation of Hirohito's son, Emperor Akihito. Early Sunday, Akihito and Empress Michiko presided over a quiet ceremony at an Imperial Palace chamber where, by tradition, an emperor's spirit is enshrined until his tomb is completed.
