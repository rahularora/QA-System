The most detailed survey of the Milky Way will start Thursday at the world's most sensitive radio telescope, an array of 27 dish shaped antennas spread across New Mexico's desert. Without a doubt this will give us the most comprehensive picture of our galaxy yet obtained in any kind of wavelength, including visible light and radio and infrared radiation, said Robert H. Becker, associate professor of astronomy at the University of California, Davis. The $1 million, two year survey will be conducted by Becker and astronomer David Helfand of Columbia University.

The Milky Way Galaxy, home of the sun and the Earth, has a core shaped like a football instead of the perfectly spherical center many astronomers have long believed, according to a new study. Astronomers at the University of Maryland and Princeton University announced Thursday the discovery of evidence that the spiral arms of the Milky Way actually rotate around an oval center, causing the sun to follow an elliptical path in its 200 million year orbit of the galaxy center. Leo Blitz of the University of Maryland said that the discovery shows that the Milky Way is a so called barred spiral galaxy.

The new findings, expanding on preliminary 1987 observations, show galaxies on both sides of the attractor are swerving toward it in addition to their normal motion away from each other, said Alan Dressler of the Carnegia Instititon of Washington and Sandra Faber of the University of California at Santa Cruz. The sun and its solar system, which includes the Earth, are located in one spoke, about midway out from the galaxy center.

The sun and its solar system, which includes the Earth, are located in one spoke, about midway out from the galaxy center. That spoke, along with the four other arms of the Milky Way, rotate about the galaxy core. Though the rotation rate of the arm at the sun's location is about 600,000 miles an hour, the galaxy is so large that it takes about 200 million years to complete one rotation, or orbit.

A huge disk of hydrogen gas discovered 65 million light years away suggests that galaxies are still being formed in the universe, a finding that could modify the current theory that star systems formed within a relatively short time after the big bang. Riccardo Giovanelli, head of the Radio Astronomy Group at the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and Martha Haynes, associate professor of astronomy at Cornell University, found the gas cloud earlier this year using the 1,000 foot radiotelescope dish at Arecibo. Others astronomers said Tuesday that the findings were exciting and important and could reshape the current view of the history of the universe.

Once the mystery of the dark matter is solved, he said, we may find something completely unexpected that could revolutionize our thinking about physics.

Once the mystery of the dark matter is solved, he said, we may find something completely unexpected that could revolutionize our thinking about physics. Andrew Fraknoi, executive director of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in San Francisco, said the discovery is important because it is another confirmation that the Milky Way is much larger than once thought.

The National Science Foundation says astronomers believe they have stumbled across evidence that galaxies may still be forming in the universe. The evidence is a massive cloud of hydrogen, 10 times larger than the Milky Way galaxy, all by itself and close by astronomical standards 65 million light years away, the foundation said Monday. The discovery would appear to challenge the current belief that all galaxies were formed within the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang explosion dispersed hydrogen and matter in the universe.

Astronomers on Monday announced the discovery of the most distant galaxy known, a cluster of stars 15 billion light years away that formed long before the Earth and the sun. This is very unusual and very rare, said Ken Chambers of Johns Hopkins University, one of the co discovers. We're seeing something from before the Earth formed, possibly before our own galaxy, and when the universe was very different than today.

Though the galaxy was located by radio signals, its distance from Earth was established by analyzing the optical spectrum, or type of light, put out by the galaxy.

 AP880808-0144 
Chambers said the galaxy puts out a sharp optical signal of the type characteristic of hydrogen and carbon. The wavelength of the emission, however, is stretched by movement away from the observer. This stretch causes the light color to shift toward red, the so called red shift.

The discovery of a river of gas flowing toward the middle of the Milky Way supports the belief that an infinitely dense speck more massive than 1 million suns lies at the heart of the Earth's galaxy, astronomers say.

While many astronomers believe that a massive black hole exists at the core of the Milky Way, this has still not been proven.

A 90 trillion mile long stream of gas is flowing toward the center of the Milky Way, perhaps fueling a massive black hole at the very heart of the Earth's galaxy, astronomers reported Tuesday. Researchers said their discovery is the first evidence of a thin river of gas being sucked across the heavens by the awesome gravity of a black hole. The radio telescope observation, made by an international team, provides new support for the still controversial idea that a massive black hole exists at the center of the Milky Way.

The violence of early star formation in new galaxies may be a major source of cosmic X rays, a mysterious radiation that has puzzled astronomers for decades, two Columbia University scientists said Friday. Astrophysicists David Helfand and Thomas Hamilton said they have found seven galaxies reasonably near the Earth's own Milky Way galaxy that are spewing out X rays at a hotter rate than the so called background X rays detectable all over the universe. Though they only found seven such galaxies, the scientists said that further searches may reveal many more, showing perhaps that such galaxies provide a high percentage of the cosmic X rays in the universe.

The record distance of the new galaxy means it is being seen only about a few billion years after the Big Bang, which scientists believe marked the beginning of the observable universe.

A photo taken by the Hubble Space Telescope shows a galaxy seen only as fuzzy ball by telescopes on Earth is actually so tightly packed with stars that it may harbor a black hole at its center, NASA said Wednesday. The picture, which an official said was taken to prove to the public that the Hubble is not broken, shows a galaxy 400 times more tightly packed with stars than the sun's own Milky Way galaxy. Scientists said the Hubble photo captured more detail of the galaxy than is possible by Earthbound telescopes and was thus able to determine that the stellar group had many more stars than expected.

The theory of an expanding universe supported the belief that the universe originated in a cosmic explosion and that all matter is still rushing from the site of that so called Big Bang. Astronomers think the Big Bang occurred 12 billion to 20 billion years ago and sent the entire universe flying out at incredible speed and heat. Eventually matter cooled and condensed into galaxies, stars and planets.

Astronomers have identified for the first time what they believe is a brown dwarf star, a stellar body that lacks the mass to trigger the fusion reaction that gives stars their brilliant light. The National Science Foundation announced Thursday that Philip A. Ianna of the University of Virginia and Michael S. Bessell of the Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories in Australia identified the candidate brown dwarf after taking measurements of its brightness and mass. Visible only in the skies of the southern hemisphere, the dim, red stellar body equals about 5 percent of the mass of the sun.

Like an immense gravitational magnet, a vast celestial structure nicknamed the great attractor is pulling powerfully at the Milky Way and more than 100 other galaxies, causing a dramatic distortion in the normal expansion of the nearby universe. The structure has been shown in new studies to be pulling on galaxies from across more than 100 million light years of space, astronomer Alan Dressler said Thursday at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. Dressler, with the Carnegie Institution of Washington, said he and Sandra Faber of the University of California at Santa Cruz have confirmed the influence of the great attractor by measuring the movements of about 400 galaxies and comparing that motion with what is considered normal for an expanding universe.

Astronomers say they have documented the creation of an extremely dense, spinning star known as a pulsar for the first time, an insight that could change beliefs about how big stars explode. The discovery, reported Thursday, confirms a theory that pulsars are created by the explosion of enormous stars, called supernovas, said Carl Pennypacker, a research physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The pulsar, a highly dense star known as a neutron star, spins nearly 2,000 times per second, according to Pennypacker, who said its speed is three times faster than anything researchers have observed before.

Astronomers in Chile gathered the first data that documented the discovery Jan. 18, Pennypacker said, adding that a team of about eight researchers has been interpreting the information since then. More observations are expected soon from telescopes in Australia and Chile, he said.

NASA discovered after it was launched that the Hubble's mirror was flawed during construction, rendering it less powerful than planned until a space shuttle crew can fix it in 1993.

Scientists say they have made the most detailed look at the center of the Milky Way galaxy and found what appears to be a massive black hole gobbling up one star every 5,000 to 10,000 years. Computer generated pictures released Wednesday at a American Astronomical Society meeting show an object 1 million times the size of the sun that seems to be spinning off what appears to be clusters of gas, said Northwestern University astronomer Farhad Yusef Zadeh. This is the most detailed look at the center of our galaxy, and it is similar, in a scaled down version, to what we expect to see in the nuclei of active galaxies, said Yusef Zadeh in a telephone interview Wednesday night.

Lilly said his research involved identifying the source of a distant emission of radio waves that was recorded in 1981. He used the Canada France Hawaii optical telescope and the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope both located atop Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano to pick up light and infrared radiation from the precise point where the radio emission had been detected.

One of the nation's oldest astronomical treasures, the mothballed 100 inch telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California, will be recommissioned under a new ownership plan for the facility, the Carnegie Institution announced Thursday. The institution, which built the observatory in 1904 and has operated it since, retired the big Hooker telescope in 1985 as it shifted its priorities to development of more powerful instruments at its new observatory in Las Campanas, Chile. For three decades, the Hooker telescope, completed in 1917, was the world's largest, and the prototype for all modern day reflecting telescopes.

As a momentous year for astronomical observations draws to a close, scientists remain in a ferment of uncertainty about the origins, structure and future of the universe. The first pictures of the emerging universe transmitted by the US Cosmic Background Explorer (Cobe) satellite, together with observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, have inspired new cosmological theories without dismissing the old front runners. The only clear landmark is still the Big Bang itself.

The first big radio telescope array in the Southern Hemisphere began operating Friday, opening a new window on the little explored southern sky. We'll be looking at the center of our galaxy because it passes right above our head in the Southern Hemisphere, said Dr. Ron Ekers, the director of the instrument named the Australia Telescope. Much of the galaxy and the nearest neighboring galaxy, the Magellanic Cloud is not visible to observatories in the Northern Hemisphere.

Ekers, who for seven years was director of the 27 dish, Very Large Array radio telescope in western New Mexico, said the telescope will study black holes and pulsars. The new $40 million instrument located on the windswept plains of western New South Wales, consists of five new 72.6 foot dishes mounted on 1.86 miles of railroad track.
