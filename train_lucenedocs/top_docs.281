Former Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro says both Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican George Bush did well in Sunday night's debate, but Bush's success came probably because I taught him how to do it. Ms. Ferraro, who debated Bush during the 1984 campaign, also said her unsuccessful campaign would continue to be significant until a woman is elected to the White House. I have a place in history, she said Monday night before a speech at Emory University.

Clearly in 1984 in my opinion, Geraldine Ferraro cost Walter Mondale votes probably. In Richard Nixon's unsuccessful campaign of 1960, some thought that Republican vice presidential candidate Henry Cabot Lodge hurt the ticket's chances by pledging that Nixon would appoint a black to the Cabinet a statement Nixon disavowed. Lodge, a former ambassador to the United Nations, also was criticized for taking naps and not campaigning hard enough.

The NOW president also said the Democratic Party could lose the women's vote and the 1988 presidential election if it doesn't pay more attention to women's issues. Yard warned that millions of women would vote Republican if the GOP is perceived as caring more than the Democrats about women. Even though their platform is a disaster, they'll get votes because they're seriously considering a woman as a vice presidential candidate, Yard said of the Republicans.

Geraldine Ferraro, who four years ago became the first woman on a major party's national ticket, said today she was delighted with Michael Dukakis' plans to name Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his Democratic running mate.

But because we don't have a woman in that spot, I am not (disappointed), she said in a telephone interview from New York.

Zaccaro's attorney, Charles Tetzlaff argued that Zaccaro should be released from probation early because he is beginning his first semester as a law student at Catholic University in Washington, D.C., and would have to return monthly to New York state, which is supervising his probation.

True, Woodrow Wilson was born in Virginia, but he won his political fame as governor of New Jersey, so he hardly counted as a Southerner in political terms. But then came Jimmy Carter, a Southerner born and bred, who used the governorship of Georgia as his springboard to the White House. He didn't win by much, but he won with a lot of Yankee votes.

Geraldine Ferraro or her husband, John Zaccaro, in connection with federal financial disclosure statements. Ms. Ferraro was the Democratic vice presidential candidate in 1984. Last May, department officials announced the close of a lengthy criminal investigation of the matter, which began in summer 1984, without prosecuting Ms. Ferraro or her spouse.

But at the time, government attorneys held open the possibility of filing a civil suit over Ms. Ferraro's failure to disclose her husband's finances on annual federal financial reports while she served in Congress. Over the weekend, a Justice Department spokeswoman said the decision came after government attorneys concluded that they didn't have sufficient evidence to show that the former Democratic lawmaker knowingly or willfully violated federal disclosure laws.

Sen. Lloyd Bentsen is more a plus than he is a minus on women's issues, but his stance on Contra aid and defense spending could alienate women voters in November, women's groups said Tuesday. The Texas senator, Democrat Michael Dukakis' running mate choice, offers a mixed record that could turn some women voters to Republican George Bush, especially if Bush picks a female running mate, said Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women. If you're a Democrat it's very worrisome, she said.

A state jury here acquitted the husband of 1984 Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro of extortion charges. John A. Zaccaro, a 54 year old New York real estate broker, was on trial in his home borough of Queens on charges that he conspired with the borough's then president in 1981 to solicit a bribe, never paid, from a local cable television concern that was seeking a franchise. The innocent verdict, which came after the jury deliberated six hours, wasn't a surprise, because the district attorney's key witness from the cable company had unexpectedly denied Mr. Zaccaro tried to extort money.

Zaccaro, 24, was accompanied in court by his parents, Ferraro and John Zaccaro Sr. Judge Francis McCaffery imposed the gag order at the request of defense attorneys, who were concerned that too many reporters in the room could intimidate potential jurors. But he lifted it after a challenge from media representatives and an agreement among lawyers to allow six reporters to observe the proceedings. Robert Hemley, a lawyer representing media organizations, including The Associated Press, told the judge there would be publicity regardless of whether the questioning of jurors was public.

Four years ago, Mondale interviewed a succession of candidates before he chose Geraldine Ferraro, then a congresswoman from New York, as the first woman on a major party's national ticket. One by one, the vice presidential hopefuls visited Mondale at his home in Minnesota.

Wallace, who had served four years as vice president and wanted another four. But Southerners opposed Wallace and he was not well liked in the Senate.

With jury selection almost completed, opening arguments were scheduled Thursday in the cocaine trial of John Zaccaro Jr. After three days of closely questioning 30 potential jurors, prosecutors and defense lawyers prepared to narrow the group to the 12 people who will decide whether Zaccaro is guilty of illegally selling a regulated drug. The state maintains that Zaccaro, then a student at Middlebury College, sold a quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police officer two years ago. The two sides have closely questioned the potential jurors, trying to determine any biases stemming from the publicity given the case and from the fact that Zaccaro, now 24, is the son of former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.

The state Democratic Party has mailed 65,000 applications for Indiana's first political affinity credit card. The VISA card issued by Indiana National Bank could raise as much as $200,000 a year for the state Democratic party, said state chairman John B. Livengood. The Democratic Party will make a profit off the card by taking a cut of the fees, typically 5 percent per purchase charged to merchants and paid to credit card companies.

Potential jurors questioned Tuesday in the cocaine trial of John Zaccaro Jr. said their judgment would not be influenced by the fact that the defendant's mother is former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.

Mindful of Geraldine Ferraro's ill fated vice presidential quest in 1984, Michael Dukakis had aides accompany Sen. Lloyd Bentsen on his first campaign solo flight. The 67 year old Bentsen is no stranger to campaign work, and the silver haired senator took several of his own aides with him on the campaign foray to California, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas last week. Officials in both the Dukakis and Bentsen camps remember how Ferraro, Walter F. Mondale's running mate four years ago, hit the campaign trail unprepared, and want to closely coordinate campaign activities.
