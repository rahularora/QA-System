An expedition has discovered remains of a gigantic whale dinosaur and a brontosaurus that lived more recently than other known dinosaurs of its type, scientists announced. University of Colorado Paleontologist Robert Bakker said Wednesday that the two finds in the fertile dinosaur fields of southern Wyoming are providing important clues about dinosaur extinction. Bakker said the remains of a 70 foot long Haplocanthosaurus, a member of the cetiosaur or whale dinosaur family, were found in the Como Bluffs area near McFadden, Wyo., last July.

The discovery of two giant dinosaurs in Wyoming is reigniting debate over why the huge beasts became extinct. Colorado paleontologist Robert Bakker, who led the team that found the dinosaur remains, said Thursday the discoveries reinforce his theory that dinosaurs became extinct gradually. A scientist at the Smithsonian Institution who supports the theory that dinosaurs met their end suddenly, in a cosmic collision, says the latest finds prove nothing of the sort.

Small land animals including the ferocious 6 ounce Mutant Ninja Chipmunk thrived while an environmental crisis killed off most giant dinosaurs more than 100 million years ago, a researcher found. Dr. Robert Bakker, a University of Colorado paleontologist, said fossils recently unearthed from a 130 million year old deposit in a rock quarry in Wyoming showed small dinosaurs, mammals, turtles and other animals flourished in the early Cretaceous period a few million years after the giant dinosaurs that lived in the Jurassic period became extinct. The new fossils are the remains of animals that lived in a crisis interval during the early Cretaceous Period, and this is the first rock layer that seems to record just what happened and why, Bakker said Wednesday.

<P> Fossils of at least four new species of animals discovered in Wyoming cast doubt on the theory that comets colliding with the Earth killed off some dinosaurs 130 million years ago and all dinosaurs 65 million years later, a Colorado paleontologist said Wednesday. </P> <P> The new species include a 20 pound herbivorous dinosaur, a bizarre mammal that the researchers have nicknamed a mutant ninja chipmunk and a high tech turtle. They flourished after the large dinosaurs that preceded them were exterminated 130 million years ago by an unknown environmental catastrophe, said Robert Bakker of the University of Colorado at Boulder.

Scientists from China and Canada said today that they unearthed a mass grave of sheep sized baby dinosaurs who were apparently buried during a sandstorm 75 million years ago. Dr. Philip Currie, of the Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in Alberta, said the joint team excavated the skulls of five baby Pinacosaurus in the wastelands of southern Inner Mongolia. He said they found a sixth baby on the last day of their summer expedition, and it appears likely there are a number of other specimens.

In general, paleontologists can collect stuff faster than it can be prepared, said Michael E. Williams, who helped identify Happy, a 140 million year old relative of the Brontosaurus.

The sound gun is a commercial kind used to search for oil by studying the speed of sound waves bouncing off various underground rocks, not by making an image, he added. Several tail vertebrae from the seismosaurus, a relative of brontosaurus and diplodocus, were discovered by two hikers in 1979. The exposed bones were excavated in June 1985 by David Gillette, then paleontology curator at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and now Utah's state paleontologist.

Gillette announced the find in August 1986, coining the name seismosaurus, or earth shaker. The seismosaurus lived in a hot, humid river delta much like today's Mississippi, and probably laid down on a river sandbar and was covered by sand rather rapidly after damming water upstream, Bechtel said.

Called the Morrison Formation for a small town southwest of Denver where the first dinosaur skeleton was found here in 1877, the graveyard lies on either side of the Rocky Mountains from Idaho south to New Mexico. Paleontologists call it the capital of dinosaur research.

The American Museum of Natural History has decided that three heads are better than one when it comes to dinosaurs. The museum has revised its opinion of what the head of an apatosaurus commonly known as a brontosaurus looked like. But because the museum's 17 foot tall, 66 foot long apatosaurus skeleton was assembled in 1905 and contains bones that are 140 million years old, it was too fragile to withstand a head transplant.

Sept. 20 The Daily Journal, Vineland, N.J., on the Federal Election Commission: It should come as no surprise that the Federal Election Commission, set up in 1974 to enforce federal campaign laws, apparently has not been doing its job. (A Common Cause study) said that the commission has sanctioned campaign activities that run counter to central provisions of the post Watergate reform laws, including the state's campaign contribution and expenditure limit. The six member commission has on a number of occasions even rejected the advice of its attorneys, who have argued for enforcement of the law.

Sept. 20 The Register Guard, Eugene, Ore., on the Brontosaurus stamp: The Postal Service is in trouble with some people for putting out a stamp with a picture of a dinosaur labeled Brontosaurus. Scientists say the correct name for what is popularly known as brontosaurus is apatosaurus. ... (One expert in paleobiology at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History) said such willful disregard for the correct name of an animal suggests that the Postal Service cares little for the accuracy of the stamps (it issues and it prefers) cartoon' nomenclature to scientific nomenclature.

The skull of a prehistoric animal has been identified as part of a previously unknown species of compact, meat eating dinosaur, scientists announced Thursday. The skull was misidentified after its discovery in 1942 in eastern Montana by an expedition from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, officials said. It was in storage in the museum's basement when it was noticed by a visiting paleontologist last year.

The discovery of the fossilized bones of a giant meat eating dinosaur predating the fearsome tyrannosaurus rex strengthens the theory that dinosaurs evolved rapidly before becoming extinct, a scientist said Thursday. The bones of an Epanterias were found at the top of the Morrison Formation deposit, an ancient saline lakebed near Fort Collins, by a paleontology team from the University of Colorado Museum in Boulder. The discovery a year and a half ago was only the third of an Epanterias, according to Robert Bakker, a research associate at the museum, who announced the find Wednesday.

The Epanterias, which weighed about four tons and was 50 feet long, could have eaten about 40 tons of meat annually, and its ability to expand its enormous jaws much like modern day snakes would have allowed Epanterias to gulp huge bites of prey easily.

' The discoveries are discussed in a book published this week titled Dawn of the Age of Dinosaurs in the American Southwest, edited by Hunt and museum paleontologist Spencer Lucas. Lucas said it was the first new genus of dinosaur discovered in New Mexico since 1923 and the first new dinosaur species found in the state in nearly 30 years. We're breaking a lot of new ground after a long dry spell, he said.

A misidentified dinosaur skull found in the Cleveland Museum of Natural History's basement came from a previously unknown meat eating reptile that was a pygmy cousin of Tyrannosaurus rex, scientists say. The skull was found on a southeast Montana farm 46 years ago by a museum expedition, but was misidentified as a gorgosaur, a relatively primitive, common carnivore, scientists said at a news conference Thursday. The new genus has been named Nanotyrannus, or pygmy tyrant, by the three scientists who discovered it.

By comparing the estimated height of the animal's leg with the distance between the tracks, Bakker concluded that it traveled at a brisk 8 mph or so, faster than a pack of wolves, not at the sluggish speed of a cold blooded reptile lazily foraging for food.

If you've got that kind of information, you can tell which way evolution is going.

If you've got that kind of information, you can tell which way evolution is going. Sereno said the artist's reconstruction of the dinosaur named after an Argentine goat herder was based largely on the recent discovery of a skull and two nearly complete skeletons in South America.

Sculptor Jim Gary looks at the rusting oil pan from a junked automobile and he sees the gaping jaw of a dinosaur. Under his welding torch, the metallic bones and joints of extinct automotive behemoths from Detroit are reincarnated as Gary's artistic vision of the prehistoric giants that crawled from the ooze to roam our planet millions of years ago. Gary, a self taught sculptor from Farmingdale, N.J., has built more than 200 of his 20th century dinosaurs from the brake shoes, universal joints, leaf springs, drive shafts, hoods, front ends and other parts of scrapped cars and trucks.

It is thought that during the geologic period called Triassic, between 240 to 205 million years ago, all of the Earth's land area was connected in one large mass called Pangaea. The land mass slowly split apart, as massive plates drifted away from each other over millions of years, and the continents and islands eventually arranged themselves in their present positions.

Fossil bones of a plant eating dinosaur found in the Antarctic prove there was a mild climate there 70 million years ago, a British scientist said Thursday. We discovered jawbones, much of the vertebral column and the fore limbs, which identify the animal as a bird hipped dinosaur similar to hypsilophodon, which has been found in Australia, North Amerca, Europe and possibly North Africa, said Michael Thomson, a scientist who led an expedition to the area. There could not have been much ice or snow in the region in those days because the dinosaur was a land animal and it wouldn't have liked frosty nights.

After all, lizards and frogs have been preserved in 40m year old amber from the Dominican Republic. However, amber is not the only potential source of dinosaur DNA.

A Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton discovered by a pair of amateur fossil hunters is yielding new insights on the fearsome carnivore because it includes the only complete arm yet found. Paleontologists unearthing the fossilized skeleton in the badlands of eastern Montana say it appears to be the most complete yet found of the biggest species of predatory dinosaur. We're pretty excited, said Patrick Leiggi, one of those at the site.

The fossil remains of a rare, meat eating dinosaur that predated the more famous Tyrannosaurus Rex but rivaled it in size and ferocity have been discovered in Colorado, a scientist said Wednesday. The dinosaur, named Epanterias amplexus, weighed about four tons and measured about 50 feet long, and had a long, powerful tail that probably allowed it to bounce along like a kangaroo, said University of Colorado paleontologist Robert Bakker. The Epanterias could eat about 40 tons of meat a year and its claws seem to be the longest and the strongest of any meat eating dinosaur that ever lived, he said.

Scientists said today they have found embryo skeletons from two kinds of dinosaurs in Montana, and that the bones give further evidence that some dinosaurs may have tended their young like birds. The discovery, some 60 miles southeast of Glacier National Park, is reported in the British journal Nature. The animals lived some 75 million to 80 million years ago, John R. Horner, curator of paleontology at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Mont., said in a telephone interview.

Chinese and Canadian scientists have found what they believe may be the largest dinosaur fossils in the world, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Monday. The discovery last month of the remains of a dinosaur believed to have been 99 feet long was made in northwest China's Gobi desert by members of the Sino Canadian Dinosaur Project, the report said. The fossils, including a complete skull and 10 pieces of cervical vertebrae, were found in the Junggar basin in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, it said.

The fossils have been shipped to Beijing for laboratory analysis, Xinhua said.

An asteroid collision with Earth may have released enough gas to heat the planet 65 million years ago, causing gradual extinction of dinosaurs and other species by destroying their food, researchers say. The study drew guarded praise from a critic of the theory, because the findings attempt to explain why only certain creatures became extinct and why the extinctions were gradual, not sudden. The asteroid impact theory differs from ones in which scientists said such a collision caused mass extinction by kicking up enough dust to block sunlight, plunging the planet into a freezing darkness that killed plants, a source of food.

California Institute of Technology planetary scientist John O'Keefe and geophysicist Thomas Ahrens reached their conclusion by analyzing experiments in which Ahrens and geophysicist Manfred Lange shot steel bullets into rocks at 4,500 mph.

California Institute of Technology planetary scientist John O'Keefe and geophysicist Thomas Ahrens reached their conclusion by analyzing experiments in which Ahrens and geophysicist Manfred Lange shot steel bullets into rocks at 4,500 mph. Based on the amount of carbon dioxide released by the shattered rocks, the scientists calculated that a 6 mile diameter asteroid hitting limestone or other carbon rich rocks on Earth would have released enough carbon dioxide to increase the amount of the gas in the atmosphere two to five times.

Such an increase in the gas, which traps solar heat like glass in a greenhouse, could have caused a greenhouse effect that warmed the planet by 9 to 36 degrees Fahrenheit for 10,000 years after the asteroid struck, Ahrens said Tuesday.

The leafy plants which dinosaurs ate were selectively destroyed by the heat while other plants survived, Ahrens said. So there was probably (increased) competition for available food, and eventually food supplies declined to a point where different species, including the dinosaurs, became extinct in a less than sudden manner.

Geophysicist Charles Officer of Dartmouth College said he believes the O'Keefe Ahrens theory does not have merit because geologic evidence supports the theory that volcanoes spewed enough ash skyward to block sunlight and cause mass extinction.

It is important to learn what killed the dinosaurs because it behooves us to find out if we're just sort of sitting here awaiting another (asteroid) impact to seal our doom, or if some of the things we're doing to the environment might ... lead to the extinction of many species, Clemens said.

Scientists believe rising levels of carbon dixoide and other greenhouse gases will warm Earth 3 to 5 degrees by the year 2050, possibly causing crop threatening droughts and partly melting polar ice caps to raise sea levels and threaten coastal cities.

Ahrens said an asteroid impact not only may have triggered greenhouse heating, but possibly caused chemical reactions that formed intense acid rain, which either killed many creatures directly or wiped out their food plants.

Clemens, however, wondered how birds and other surviving species could have hidden from the corrosive downpour.
