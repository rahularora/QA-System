Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski will have to decide without the guidance he was looking for from an advisory panel whether to award benefits to some Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Derwinski is expected to make the decision around Thanksgiving as the result of court ordered regulations for determining the relationship between exposure to the herbicide exposure and cancer. Nearly 12,000 disability claims once denied by the VA are now pending as a result of a court order issued in May by U.S. District Judge Thelton E. Henderson in San Francisco.

An estimated 1,100 veterans or their survivors are expected to receive compensation for soft tissue sarcomas to start with. An additional 50 claims annually are expected thereafter, given the long latency period for cancer. Soft tissue sarcomas are a group of malignant tumors found on muscles and connective tissue or in body fat.

More Agent Orange was sprayed in Vietnam than official records show, a former commander said in a report Thursday that also suggests a discernible pattern, if not collaboration, to deny veterans compensation. Also, a Veterans Affairs Department panel issued a ruling that brings compensation closer to veterans exposed to the herbicide who suffer from soft tissue sarcoma, a rare cancer. Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., in his report to Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski, said he was certain from his experience that more Agent Orange was spread than recorded.

The decision by the Veterans Affairs Department to award compensation to Vietnam veterans suffering from one rare form of cancer doesn't resolve the dispute over exposure to Agent Orange. The decision, announced Thursday, could make it possible for the VA to close the doors to compensation for a host of ailments linked to the herbicide used in Vietnam from 1965 to 1970 to deny jungle cover to the enemy. Based on a study released the same day by the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, VA Secretary Edward J. Derwinski said he would award 100 percent disability payments to any Vietnam veteran suffering from non Hodgkin's lymphoma.

The dispute over compensating Vietnam veterans for a host of cancers and other ailments believed to be linked to Agent Orange exposure is back in federal court. In a lawsuit filed here Thursday, two veterans groups asked that federal scientists be forced to complete a study on the health effects of Agent Orange on Vietnam veterans and their children. The suit said the Reagan administration ordered the study canceled in 1987, four years after it began, because of concerns that civilian claims against government and industry would follow a decision to compensate veterans.

The Legion contends the CDC scuttled an earlier attempt at a study by saying no reliable sample of veterans can be found. The Legion says CDC has ignored detailed military records of troop movements and spraying activities that could produce such a study group. A Legion study claims to have established a connection between Agent Orange and skin rashes and blisters, fatty tissue tumors, hypersensitivity of the eyes to light, and an increased risk of miscarriages among spouses.

A long awaited government study of cancer among Vietnam veterans found no evidence linking the disease with exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange, officials said Thursday. The study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, which looked only indirectly at Agent Orange, did find veterans at increased risk of a relatively rare cancer called non Hodgkin's lymphoma. But researchers noted the risk was greater among veterans who served on ships than those who served on land, where the herbicide was used.

The Department of Veterans Affairs is taking another look at the cases of all Vietnam veterans whose benefits claims due to exposure to Agent Orange were denied, and easing the standards for receiving compensation. The change became known Thursday when VA Secretary Edward Derwinski said the government will not appeal a federal judge's decision earlier this week that struck down regulations restricting compensation for victims of Agent Orange. Derwinski's decision was seen as a major step toward disability benefits for some of the more than 34,000 veterans of the Vietnam War who have unsuccessfully sought to have the government admit their exposure to the toxic herbicide has caused health problems.

Of the claims related to Agent Orange already filed, nearly 7,000 involve three main categories of illness non Hodgkins lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma and a liver ailment known as PCT for which some contend links to Agent Orange have been established.

Dogs exposed in Vietnam to the same chemical sprays as U.S. soldiers developed almost twice as many tumors of the testicles as military dogs that served only in the United States, federal investigators report. In a study published today in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, researchers said the increased number of testicular cancers among canine veterans of Vietnam may predict the development of such tumors among American servicemen who served in the same country. The dog is a sentinel model for man, said Howard M. Hayes, a National Cancer Institute researcher and coauthor of the report.

The Centers for Disease Control said today its long awaited study of Agent Orange shows Vietnam veterans at increased risk of only one type of cancer and no evidence that the risk stems from exposure to the dangerous herbicide used in the war. The study, which had been criticized by veterans groups even before it was released, focused on Vietnam veterans and cancer, and only indirectly evaluated Agent Orange exposure, the CDC said. But it added that the cancer risk among the vets in the study seemed to be the opposite of the pattern for use of Agent Orange.

Vietnam veterans suffering from cancers and other ailments presumably linked to exposure to Agent Orange would receive government compensation under a bill introduced Tuesday in the House. The measure represents the latest round of a struggle between veterans' advocates, who say the government is ignoring evidence about the deadly herbicide, and government scientists, who say no clear cause and effect can be established. This legislation takes the important breakthrough step in creating a presumption that certain conditions, if developed in an individual after exposure, are presumed related to that exposure and are our country's responsibility not a burden of that conflict to be borne in tragic isolation by the veteran, said Rep. David E. Skaggs, D Colo., a Marine veteran of Vietnam and one of 60 co sponsors of the bill.

An estimated 2.6 million military personnel served within the borders of South Vietnam. About 250,000 have told VA they believe they were exposed, and 35,000 have applied for disability benefits.

Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., whose son died of cancer after being exposed to Agent Orange that his father had ordered sprayed in Vietnam, has been named a senior adviser to Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski, the department said Friday. The appointment of Zumwalt, 68, is one of several steps the VA department has taken under Derwinski to address the concerns of veterans who have health problems that they say are linked to exposure to the defoliant. The VA said Zumwalt will counsel on a variety of issues, but the first on the agenda will be Agent Orange.

Interpretations of the CDC study by scientists, veterans organizations and the Department of Veterans Affairs have varied widely because the new report looked only obliquely at Agent Orange exposure.

Interpretations of the CDC study by scientists, veterans organizations and the Department of Veterans Affairs have varied widely because the new report looked only obliquely at Agent Orange exposure. The original intent of the study was to look at Agent Orange and its relationship to various cancers on the assumption that 25 percent of Vietnam veterans were exposed to the herbicide.

The jury remains out on Agent Orange even though a decade has passed since Congress told government scientists to determine whether a link exists between the herbicide and ailments among Vietnam veterans. Hearings last week on Capitol Hill showed that while veterans demand compensation for ills including cancer, birth defects, and miscarriages they maintain are linked to exposure to the dioxin containing substance, scientists are disputing how to go about a study. There were charges of political concerns eclipsing scientific ones, and pleas for science to yield to human concerns.

Governments officials say more will be known next spring when CDC releases a study of the incidence of selected cancers in Vietnam veterans. They also say scientists are better able to test blood for dioxin and they have a better idea how long dioxin remains in the body.

Whatever those results, one scientist says an open mind is the answer. As long as there are millions of veterans and family members who have a legitimate health concern regarding this issue, it is incumbent upon us to consider any and all possibilities, and certainly to consider new technology and lateral approaches in this area, said Dr. Michael E. Kafrissen, former visiting scientist at CDC.

The Senate approved legislation Thursday that would give Vietnam era veterans disability benefits for certain illnesses associated with U.S. use of Agent Orange. The bill provides payments on an interim basis, through April 15, 1992, while providing for subsequent congressional votes to make the benefits permanent. Benefits would be paid to veterans with non Hodgkin's lymphoma and soft tissue sarcoma.

Henderson's ruling does not require the government to add any diseases to the service connected list for Agent Orange. But Kasinitz said he was encouraged by the performance of Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward Derwinski.

A similar bill was passed by the Senate last year but died in the House, he said. </P> <P> Although Henderson's ruling does not require the government to add any diseases to the service connected list for Agent Orange, Kasinitz said the performance so far of the secretary of the new Cabinet level Department of Veterans Affairs, Edward Derwinski, provides some grounds for optimism.

Adm. Elmo R. Zumalt Jr., who ordered the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam, says the cancer death of his son moves him to work harder for compensation for other veterans affected by the toxic defoliant. There are still many hundreds of veterans who do need help, Zumwalt said Saturday, the day his son died. I believe very strongly now that the evidence is clear that the Agent Orange is responsible for the problems many veterans are having.

But Armey said in his dissent scientific information has failed to establish any conclusive link between Agent Orange and health problems.

But Armey said in his dissent scientific information has failed to establish any conclusive link between Agent Orange and health problems. He said that compensating veterans for simple exposure to Agent Orange is a political decision, not a scientific one. The VA this year decided to award compensation for two rare cancers, soft tissue sarcoma and non Hodgkin's lymphoma, linked to Agent Orange.

It comes two months after Congress voted unanimously to award permanent disability benefits to Vietnam War veterans suffering from two types of cancer they claim resulted from Agent Orange exposure non Hodgkins' disease lymphoma and soft tissue sarcoma. ; The Air Force said it compared 866 airmen who sprayed Agent Orange known as the Ranch Hand group with 804 veterans with less exposure to the herbicide and lower levels of dioxin in their blood. ; The study, conducted at the Armstrong Laboratory of Brooks Air Force Base in Texas, said there was no evidence of a relationship between dioxin and cancer of any kind, liver disease, heart disease, kidney disease, immune system disorders, psychological abnormalities or nervous system disease.

Senators advocating disability benefits for Vietnam veterans suffering from cancer they believe caused by Agent Orange said Thursday they were confident of finally winning congressional passage after repeated setbacks. Sen. John F. Kerry, D Mass., said the compromise bill would provide interim disability benefits to veterans who were exposed to the chemical defoliant during the Vietnam War and now suffer from either non Hodgkin's lymphoma or soft tissue sarcoma. Under the bill, disability benefits would extend only through 1993.

A federal judge threw out the Department of Veterans Affairs' rules on Agent Orange health benefits, and ordered the government to reconsider claims by more than 31,000 veterans. In a decision made public Monday, U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson said the agency wrongly required proof that Agent Orange causes various diseases in denying most claims for benefits related to the herbicide. Henderson, ruling on a nationwide lawsuit brought on behalf of Agent Orange claimants, said the agency formerly known as the Veterans Administration failed to give veterans the benefit of the doubt.

Mr. Havender states that, based on the information in this book, my father, Adm. E. R. Zumwalt Jr., need not feel guilt for his son's and grandson's tragic health problems. I agree that my father should not feel guilty about these problems and that only animal studies to date show birth defects. However, the conclusion that the evidence of cancer in Vietnam vets from Agent Orange is exceedingly rare and a result from whatever it is that causes these conditions among ordinary Americans of similar age may need to be modified in the light of the most recent scientific study.

A change in hydrogeological conditions was caused by a change in the mechanical state of the rocks. The greatest change in water conductivity was observed in the neighborhood of holes containing the least water. In holes penetrating andesitic porphyries there was an average increase in water conductivity from 0.26 to 0.52 m[.sup]2[/]/day, corresponding to an increase in total rock porosity from 3.8 to 5.3%.

Changes in hydrogeological conditions were caused by: an increase in the effective pressure of the fluid in water bearing rocks; a change in the mechanical, and therefore, the filtration properties of reservoir rocks; formation of new filtration channels; formation of underground voids as a result of an explosion and their subsequent filling with ground water.

A veterans group criticized a new report by the federal Centers for Disease Control that suggests most Vietnam GIs escaped heavy exposure to the poison dioxin, unless they handled the herbicide Agent Orange. This study seems to be pretty much the same data that was released a year ago, only a year ago it was portrayed rather differently, said Barry Kasinitz, a spokesman for the 35,000 member Vietnam Veterans of America. The CDC last year concluded that exposure to dioxin could not be determined using military records of troop locations and spraying of Agent Orange, which contained the deadly poison.
