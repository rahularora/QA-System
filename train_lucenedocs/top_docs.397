When the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, the Brandenburg Gate, Berlin's most famous landmark that straddled a main prewar thoroughfare, remained in the East. It was also inaccessible to East Berliners until Friday because it was part of the off limit East German border zone. The crowd carried Berlin, West German and East German flags.

The battle scarred sandstone columns of the Brandenburg Gate, which were the backdrop for Hitler's last stand and a workers' uprising against Communism in 1953, once again tower over the stage of history. The 200 year old gate, Berlin's most famous landmark, has stood as the symbol of German division for 28 years. With the Berlin Wall quickly crumbling, the gate is being called the symbol of German unity.

With the 18th century Brandenburg Gate the symbol of old Berlin, this section of wall was the symbol of its division, splitting the wide avenue that was once a main thoroughfare. After the wall was opened, a border crossing was cut into it at Brandenburg Gate and the area became a major tourist attraction. Makeshift souvenir stands hawk everything from Berlin Wall keychains to membership pins worn by East Germany's notorious former secret police.

The soot stained monument was swathed in smoke as young people from around the world clamored atop the surrounding wall and scaled even the tarnished bronze chariot that crowns the columned gate. Since East German authorities began punching holes in the graffiti splattered concrete that had severed Berlin since 1961, the wall has become more a bridge than a barrier. Tour buses from throughout Europe shuttled thousands to the heart of the party, a stretch of pock marked wall between the Brandenburg Gate in East Berlin and a towering Christmas tree on the west side.

East Germany will tear down a 600 foot section of the Berlin Wall near the Brandenburg Gate and allow completely unhindered passage between the two sides of the city there, West German television said. Since November, the East Germans have created numerous passage points through the Berlin Wall but have retained nominal checks of passports or identity cards. The section at the Brandenburg Gate will be the first section without any official controls.

A solitary building stands on the far corner of the once teeming and elegant Potsdamer Platz, now a desolate no man's land overlooking a jagged corner of the Berlin Wall. Potsdamer Platz will soon regain at least a semblance of its former prominence after 28 years as a Cold War curiosity, East German officials said Friday. Devastated during World War II and long a lonely tourist attraction for a glimpse over the Berlin Wall, Potsdamer Platz will shortly become another major transit checkpoint between East and West Berlin.

Workers on Saturday began tearing down the thickest and perhaps most famous part of the Berlin Wall, a stretch of graffiti covered concrete in front of the historic Brandenburg Gate. Crowds of tourists and souvenir peddlers watched as East German soldiers and West German construction workers with heavy tools began knocking away at the section ofwall that curves around the 18th century gate. The huge, colonnaded gate represents the grandeur of old Berlin just as the section of wall in front of it symbolized its division.

The Berlin Wall will be opened before Christmas at the Brandenburg Gate, the towering monument viewed by many as a symbol of German unity, East German Premier Hans Modrow said today. The announcement followed a meeting between Modrow and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, during which the two leaders discussed the thorny issue of how to bring the long divided nations closer together. Since the Berlin Wall started crumbling early last month, Germans in both East and West have demanded an opening at the gate to demonstrate the new era of improved relations between the countries.

Until Sunday, West Germans were required to obtain a visa to travel into East Germany and were obliged to change 25 marks, about $15, each day, a hefty sum for young people and the elderly. Now, West Germans simply must show an identity card and fill out a short form so that the East Germans are able to keep track of the number of visitors. West German border police reported that East Germans greeted their West German neighbors with flowers and a welcome drink in numerous villages along the border even before the new rules became official.

Germany today marked a year since the opening of the Berlin Wall, a joyful anniversary interlocked with a bitter one: the night in 1938 when breaking glass heralded the Holocaust, war and German partition. Officials of newly united Germany also warmly welcomed Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who arrived in Bonn today to a 27 man military honor guard. The Soviet president's visit is highly symbolic since his reforms helped collapse the Iron Curtain and open the Berlin Wall.

The warming trend between East and West has had a positive side effect for foreigners, with visitors no longer required to hand over a minimum of $14 for each day of their stay in East Germany Under an aid agreement with Bonn, East Germany has ended its age old Zwangsumtausch, or the forced exchange that aimed to increase the socialist state's hard currency coffers. Officials from the two nations announced in December that West Germans would no longer be required to make the minimum conversion after Jan. 1. The extension of the benefit to other foreigners has come as a surprise.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the Brandenburg Gate, now sheared of its barbed wire curls, a procession of famous Western TV anchors from several dozen countries waited their turn to do stand ups in the floodlit splendor of this landmark rubbled arch. Even at the Museum at Checkpoint Charlie with its bizarre collection of motorbikes, battered buses, homemade submarines and hot air balloons that had confounded East Berlin's wall guards, patrol dogs and mine fields NBC's Tom Brokaw and crew had to line up for an interview with the curators. At the CSSR Kultur und Informationszentrum just a few hundred yards to the east, there was no wait for interviews and no culture customers either, despite a display of children's patriotic poster art.
