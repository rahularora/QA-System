Psychologist Charles Hoffman of California State University, San Bernardino, said the findings indicate there should be an affirmative action program for divorced fathers, who currently lose custody of their children in 90 percent of failed marriages. ; Sex roles won't change until (divorced) mothers and fathers parent equally, he said. ; Only half had weekly contact; The study of older divorced fathers, conducted by sociologist Peter Uhlenberg at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, found that only half of the 261 subjects had weekly contact with their adult children, compared to 90 percent of married men.

Everything is in the 'best interest of the child,' notes Clare Robinson, a child psychologist at the Cleveland Clinic. But, she adds, too often the child becomes a secondary consideration for parents unwilling to care for kids full time or to bear the full financial burden. For the child, the most direct impact of dividing time between parents is having to physically shuttle back and forth.

Fathers can help boys achieve higher educational development by providing social and emotional support in childhood, but for daughters the key age for offering support is adolescence, a new study suggests. Shooting a basketball on the court in the evening with your (adolescent) daughter has a positive effect ... on how far she'll go in education, said researcher John Snarey. But sons will benefit more from such activities as taking them trick or treating, supporting their joining the Boy Scouts and spending time with them before bedtime, all while the child is between ages 1 and 10, the study suggests.

<P> The most important hearing in the landmark custody battle over a baby born to surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson opened Tuesday, featuring testimony that any woman who gives birth to a child has the right to call herself the parent even if the child is not genetically related to her. </P> <P> Dr. Michelle Harrison, a psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh and a consultant to the National Coalition Against Surrogacy, said that birth mothers are the biological mothers of the children they bear, even if another couple provided the egg and sperm that made the baby, as Mark and Crispina Calvert, an infertile couple, did in Johnson's case. </P> <P> She is the mother of the baby because she gestated and gave birth to that child, said Harrison, who has studied the psychological impact of new reproductive technology on mothers and their children.

Studies with some 400 children of divorce show improvement in a variety of areas, including solving day to day problems, communicating with relatives, coping with family changes, getting along with schoolmates and completing schoolwork, researchers said. The children said they were less anxious, less likely to blame themselves for the divorce and less worried about family circumstances, researchers said. Pedro Carroll and colleague Linda Alpert Gillis, both clinical psychologists, spoke in interviews before describing the program Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association.

The natural father of a girl who was adopted at birth more than seven years ago asked the Supreme Court on Monday to restore parental rights he contends were revoked unconstitutionally. Edward McNamara contends that San Diego authorities unconstitutionally denied him the opportunity to raise the girl, who was conceived during a brief romance with a woman that ended eight months before the baby's birth. McNamara, now 42, did not learn that he had become a father until after the infant's birth and the mother sought his consent to put the child, named Katie, up for adoption.

Two men claiming fatherhood of a 7 year old girl are asking the U.S. Supreme Court for a Solomon like decision which could affect other fathers in so called reverse paternity cases. This case arises out of a societal phenomenon of men assuming the responsibility we've always told them to assume as parents, says attorney Larry Hoffman. The case is scheduled to be heard Tuesday by the high court.

A divorced father is helping to make a movie about his seven year custody visitation battle over his daughters, but the girls' mother has gone to court in hopes of stopping what she sees as exploitation. Don Chavez, president of the National Congress for Men in Washington and founder of the Albuquerque based Dads Against Discrimination, said the movie will be about Dad trying to regain a meaningful place in the lives of his children. The plot has a father organizing a group of other fathers in the same situation in an attempt to change the way judges award custody and visitation rights.

A parent may consent on behalf of a child to donate bone marrow to a sibling, but only when it would be in the child's best interest, the Illinois Supreme Court said Thursday. Justices made the ruling to explain their decision Sept. 28 to uphold a judge's order refusing to force a leukemia victim's young half siblings to be tested as potentially life saving bone marrow donors. The leukemia victim, 13 year old Jean Pierre Bosze, died Nov. 19 at his home in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates after a two year illness.

In dealing with that case, the high court cited three factors that must be weighed in future cases to determine when a parent or guardian can approve a child's being a transplant donor: The parent or guardian must be informed of the risks and benefits inherent in the donation.

A couple won't seek custody of a 10 year old girl they believe is their daughter, but they still want genetic testing done to determine whether they are her real parents, their lawyer said Friday. Ernest and Regina Twigg of Langhorne, Pa., would settle for a chance to visit with the girl, and make her part of their family, said John Blakely, the Twiggs' attorney. They were becoming very frustrated with the public's perception.

Parents sometimes falsely accuse one another of sexual abuse to win custody, Yates said. The child is liable to lose contact with a father who's a valuable parent and sometimes whether the abuse happened or not, they come to the feeling that it must have happened, she said.
