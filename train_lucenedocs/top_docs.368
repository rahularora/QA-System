PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) Abu Bakr, the Moslem leader whose rebels captured the prime minister and his Cabinet in a coup attempt, has been fighting with the government for years. Most recently, Bakr has been involved in a dispute over medical supplies and pharmaceuticals reportedly donated by Libya and prohibited by customs agents from entering the country. One of the first things Bakr did after taking the leaders captive was accuse the government of refusing to let him distribute free medicine to the poor people of Trinidad and Tobago.

PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) A Moslem zealot's attempt to overthrow the government, and the burning and looting that accompanied it, have staggered Trinidad after three decades of stable democracy. The rebels surrendered Wednesday and the six day coup attempt ended with the safe release of the hostages, but the casualty toll in the assault and subsequent violence was at least 38 dead and 150 wounded. Now Trinidadians face food and gasoline shortages, economic disruption from a week of paralyzing curfews and the devastation left by looters and arsonists.

HISTORY Columbus discovered Trinidad on his third voyage to the New World in 1498. Spain made the first successful attempt to colonize the island in 1592 and Spanish rule continued until Trinidad was captured by the British in 1797. Abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire in 1833 led to a wave of immigration from India that went on until 1915.

Pena Sanchez of the Venezuelan Guardia Nacional described as a future shipment of high quality cocaine. The cartel was said to have been shipping between 500 and 1,000 kilos of cocaine, worth between TT$175 and TT$350 million, monthly from Colombia through Venezuela via Trinidad to points in the Caribbean and North Atlantic.

] [Text] Local law enforcers have denied that there is an unwritten policy to have arrests and seizures of drugs coming from Trinidad and Tobago take place outside this country's territory. Still, no one could say why all of the major drug busts with clear Trinidad and Tobago connections are taking place everywhere in Savannah, Georgia; Wilmington, North Carolina; Frankfurt, Germany, and on Monday in Grenada but here. Repeated calls to National Security Minister Russell Huggins and Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Chief Lance Selman went unreturned up to late Friday.

PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) A failed coup attempt by Moslem extremists and widespread looting that resulted left at least 30 people dead and 150 wounded in Trinidad, a government spokesman said today.

PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) Moslem militants surrendered today and began freeing their 42 hostages, ending a six day coup attempt that seriously threatened the government and reportedly left at least 20 people dead. The 25 people who had been held hostage since Friday at the government television station left the building one by one, were searched in the middle of the street by soldiers, then taken away on an army bus, state radio said. A short time later, the leader of the coup attempt, Abu Bakr, and about 50 rebels left the building, dropped their weapons in the street, put their hands behind their heads, and surrendered to soldiers, witnesses said.

Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN [Text] Port of Spain, Trinidad, 8 Jan, CANA Trinidad and Tobago's police commissioner, Jules Bernard, has issued a stern warning to Muslim leader Yasin Abu Bakr [name as received], whose followers staged a coup attempt here in 1990. I wish to advise all concerned that the police service, as the state agency charged with the responsibility to maintain law and order in the society, would take prompt and decisive action to deal with any attempt to disrupt the peace, order and tranquility of the society, Bernard said after Abu Bakr said his group felt as oppressed as it had when it staged the insurrection. It is important that all persons who may be inclined to embark on a path of unconventional behaviour be warned that the police would be vigilant and prepared to deal with any such activities.
