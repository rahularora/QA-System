The trend is breadth: The public is interested in everything, says Edward A. Morrow Jr., president of the American Booksellers and owner of the Northshire Bookstore in Manchester Center, Vt. Mr. Morrow says that the vast expansion in bookstores in the 1980s, coupled with the demographic growth of book buying, well educated yuppies, has led to an increase in book sales in many areas, from computer and self help books to literary fiction. Mr. Morrow says that he added non book items to his own stock in years past for defensive reasons, because margins were better. But now, it's so important to have depth to be competitive that we're looking to cut back in stationery and maybe games, so we'll have more room for books.

This is not a freedom of speech issue the sole reason is the protection of our employees, Bonnie Predd, executive vice president of Waldenbooks, said after the chain ordered its copies removed from display Thursday. Waldenbooks has fought long and hard against censorship, but when it comes to the safety of Waldenbooks employees and our customers, we must act responsibly in their interests, said a statement read today by Grace Castricone of Waldenbooks' marketing department. Telephone calls by The Associated Press to Waldenbooks stores nationwide Thursday night found that the Salman Rushdie novel which provoked the Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, to call for the author's death was available for sale on request in a few stores, but was not on display.

Despite a consensus among publishing executives that this fall will bring more blockbusters than last year's disappointing lineup, there are still some jitters in the industry after tumultuous times. During the past six months, several big publishers took substantial write downs against earnings, several small publishers were put up for sale and an earlier wave of big mergers was followed by consolidation and staff cuts at many houses. At the same time, growth of the big bookstore chains was slowing down.

Political literature is booming as the bans and restrictions imposed by Chile's right wing military government appear to be coming to an end. Books ranging from Gabriel Garcia Marquez's latest to controversial political essays have become best sellers, and literary experts believe the trend will continue because of the outgoing government of conservative President Gen. Augusto Pinochet. After seizing power in a bloody 1973 coup, Pinochet decreed a total ban on political activities.

We got in 25 copies yesterday; they were all reserved, said John Evans, owner of Lemuria Bookstores in Jackson, Miss. I wish I had been smart enough to order 150 I blew it.

The Waldenbooks chain, a unit of Kmart Corp., sold 3,300 copies of the Kitty Kelley book Monday, about 10,000 more yesterday, and told Simon &amp; Schuster it expects to sell as many as 40,000 copies for the week. This is unprecedented for us; we sold out our entire stock in one day, said David Hogue of Baker &amp; Taylor, one of the country's biggest book wholesalers.

Simon &amp; Schuster fanned the flames of media curiosity by withholding copies of the book until the last minute, so that revelations like Mrs. Reagan's alleged affair with Frank Sinatra didn't leak out and dilute the book's news value. Among the book's severest critics is former President Ronald Reagan, who said in a statement Monday that many of the incidents in the book are patently untrue, from the allegation of marijuana use to marital infidelity.

The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday issued complaints against six of the nation's largest book publishers for allegedly discriminating illegally against independent bookstores by selling books at discounted prices to major chains. The complaints alleged that the six publishers sell books at lower prices to large bookstore chains, including the nation's three largest: Waldenbooks Inc., B. Dalton Bookseller and Crown Books Corp. The complaints were issued against Harper &amp; Row Publishers Inc.; The Hearst Corp. and William Morrow and Co.

One can say that Ken Follett will have to sell a great many more copies than he has sold in the past. By one estimate, Mr. Follett's next publisher will have to sell 350,000 hardcover copies and more than two million paperbacks of each novel, just to break even. Mr. Archer, reached in London, said I think it's common knowledge there was a pre emptive bid six or eight weeks ago for $20 million {for two novels and a book of short stories}, which I rejected.

While these newest mega advances are shocking the industry, they don't break the record. Novelist Stephen King has reportedly received advances of $30 million for his next three books. But then, say publishing insiders, Mr. King routinely sells more than one million copies in hardcover and may be the only writer around who can demand that much money and still leave his publisher with a profit.

Readers are grabbing copies of two books in particular, Saddam Hussein and the Crisis in the Gulf, by Judith Miller and Laurie Mylroie, and Republic of Fear: The Inside Story of Saddam's Iraq, by Samir al Khalil, booksellers said. ; Those are the ones that are scooped up very readily, said Clark Kepler, owner of Kepler's Books &amp; Magazines in Menlo Park. I think it's due to the curiosity that we all have for a man and a party and a culture that mystifies us.
