Brother fought brother and the North won again Sunday as more than 8,000 uniformed men re enacted the final charge of the Battle of Gettysburg to commemorate its 125th anniversary. Griff King of the 2nd Virginia Regiment planned to participate in Pickett's charge against a line of Union troops, where his brother would defend a ridge with the 93rd Pennsylvania Regiment. We don't agree on anything anyway, said King, a 35 year old machine operator from Weston, W.Va. About 12,500 mock soldiers and civilians in period garb took part in the three day re enactment billed as the largest ever, organizers said.

The kickoff Friday of the 125th anniversary observance of the Battle of Gettysburg thrilled Allen Nelson for a very personal reason: His father fought in it. Nelson, 70, a retired career Army officer, drove in from Sanford, Fla., for the ceremonies. He wore the uniform of a Union colonel as he watched mock soldiers pass in review to mark the start of the battle, which was fought here July 1 3, 1863.

It's the battle of Devil's Den, pitting tourist convenience against the National Park Service's desire to curtail traffic through the Gettysburg battlefield. The park service has proposed eliminating two access roads, as well as part of a third, to the historic Devil's Den area of the Pennsylvania battlefield. The idea is to move the battlefield closer to its original appearance and to halt an erosion problem at Devil's Den, an area of huge rocks that is a popular tourist spot, National Park Service spokesman Robert Davidson said Wednesday.

Grant's all out attack was beaten back by the Vicksburg garrison during a one day battle that resulted in 3,000 Union soldiers killed or wounded. The Confederates suffered about 500 casualties. Realizing a direct attack would be too costly, Grant encircled the city on land and water, starving the garrison into surrender 47 days later on July 4, 1863.

No black soldiers fought at the Battle of Franklin, but 125 years later black Civil War re enactors are reminding their fellow history buffs of the contributions African Americans made in the war. A re enactment of the 1864 battle Sunday capped a weekend of events to mark the 125th anniversary of the fight. In it Confederate Gen. John Bell Hood lost more than 6,000 soldiers, crippling the South's second biggest force, the Army of Tennessee.

Westmoreland, speaking Monday in a Memorial Day ceremony at Gettysburg National Cemetery, said the three day Battle of Gettysburg and other confrontations in the Civil War played a crucial role in the evolution of the United States. A nation is never fully formed, Westmoreland told about 1,000 spectators in the cemetery where President Abraham Lincoln delivered his famed Gettysburg Address in 1863.

Now Kefauver and his family are swept up in a struggle over efforts to protect the Antietam National Battlefield Park from encroaching development. It is typical of many struggles being fought out as the great cities of America extend their suburbs into the once quiet countryside. Battles were fought near areas that had strategic importance then and, since they had strategic importance then, they would have growth potential now, says Edwin Bearss, chief historian of the National Park Service and a specialist on the Civil War.

About 4,000 volunteers dressed as Union and Confederate soldiers Sunday marked the 125th anniversary of the end of the Civil War by recreating the solemn surrender of Gen. Robert E. Lee's troops. Nearly 8,000 spectators, some wearing bonnets and hoopskirts from 1865, stood behind wooden fences along the old stage road through Appomattox Court House National Historic Park. There was scattered applause and a few rebel yells as a man playing Confederate Gen. John Gordon rode a stocky chestnut horse in front of a column of rebel soldiers marching four abreast between Union troops with shouldered arms.

On Sunday, the remains were sealed inside a plain, pine coffin and buried with full military honors at Antietam National Cemetery.

About 4,000 volunteers dressed as Union and Confederate soldiers Sunday marked the 125th anniversary of the end of the Civil War by recreating Gen. Robert E. Lee's solemn surrender to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Nearly 8,000 spectators, some wearing bonnets and hoopskirts from 1865, stood behind wooden fences along the old stage road through Appomattox Court House National Historic Park. There was scattered applause and a few rebel yells as a man playing Confederate Gen. John Gordon rode a stocky chestnut horse in front of a column of rebel soldiers marching four abreast between Union troops with shouldered arms.

Soviet Defense Minister Dimitri Yazov, making his first visit to the United States, is meeting with President Bush and touring the Civil War battlefield at Gettysburg, Pa. Pentagon officials said Yazov's trip today to the battlefield where Union troops turned back Gen. Robert E. Lee's Confederate soldiers in a key, bloody battle was prompted by his interest in the war between the states. Yazov met Monday for more than four hours with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney at the Pentagon, officials said. A senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described the talks as relaxed, candid, generally non polemical, informative.

I would describe it as a tremendous gift to the people of America, and indeed to the international visitors who come to our national parks, said James Ridenour, director of the U.S. National Park Service. The gift includes 280 acres of farmland near Sharpsburg, Md., that will be added to the Antietam National Battlefield, site of the 1862 Civil War battle that resulted in more than 20,000 casualties in a single day. Ridenour said he considers the preservation of the Civil War sites especially important because of a fever pitch of public interest in the battlefields.

More than a century after Union and Confederate soldiers spilled blood over stretches of land from Pennsylvania to Virginia, a group is battling developers for the real estate. The Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites was organized last summer to buy land or development rights of battlefields unprotected by the National Park Service or other organizations. All of us have watched over the past couple of years as a tremendous amount of historic ground has disappeared, said Gary W. Gallagher, a Penn State University history professor who is president of the organization.

The House approved legislation Tuesday that establishes boundaries for the Gettysburg National Military Park, where President Lincoln delivered his historic address and the Union and Confederate armies fought a key battle of the Civil War. By voice vote, the House adopted the bill that allows the Interior Department to acquire land and interests in land within the established boundaries by purchase, donation, exchange or other means. The park, which was transferred from the War Department to the National Park Service in 1933, includes approximately 3,900 acres of Pennsylvania land, including about 3,700 that are owned by the federal government.

The Senate Energy and Natural Resources subcommittee on public lands, national parks and forests will meet Sept. 8 to consider legislation which the House passed 307 98 on Wednesday to buy the 542 acre mall site next to the battlefield where the Confederacy won two major battles in 1861 and 1862.

National Park Service officials are pursuing a plan to buy and remove a 370 foot high observation tower that has overlooked the Civil War battlefield here for 15 years. My opinion is that the tower dominates the skyline at Gettysburg and it's totally out of keeping with what we're trying to accomplish here in preserving the battlefield, John Earnst, Gettysburg National Military Park superintendent, said Tuesday. The preliminary proposal is part of a study ordered by Congress to determine permanent boundaries for the park, site of the 1863 Union victory and President Abraham Lincoln's legendary address.

The federal government will ask private groups and state and local governments to cooperate in preserving the nation's historic battlefields, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said Friday. The American Battlefield Protection Plan eventually will cover all wars fought on U.S. soil, but will begin by focusing on 25 key Civil War sites, Lujan said. Because the government can't afford to buy all the land involved, he said, a cooperative effort is needed to make sure the farms and fields where Union and Confederate soldiers fought aren't overwhelmed by shopping malls and industrial parks.
