Since 1973, Pinochet played the role of the firm but just father of the nation,' trying to make Chileans forget the bloody history of his ascension to the throne, his betrayal of the Constitution, the murder of Salvador Allende, Soviet political observer I. Fesynenko said on the TV. But Fesynenko noted that: First of all, Pinochet will be in power until March 1990, and only in December 1989 will presidential elections be held in the country, if the dictatorship does not abolish them first.

Critics accused President Augusto Pinochet on Friday of lifting the exile ban only to gain votes, but whatever the motive, many Chilean artists and performers will be able to work in their own country. Gen. Pinochet, who seeks to win eight more years in office as the sole candidate in a presidential referendum Oct. 5, announced Thursday that all 430 remaining political exiles may come home. One daughter of the late President Salvador Allende, overthrown in the coup led by Pinochet in September 1973, already has returned and Allende's widow and other daughter have said they will come back.

Opposition candidate Patricio Aylwin trounced Gen. Augusto Pinochet's former finance minister Thursday in elections to end the right wing military president's 16 year rule. Official election results from 93 percent of the country's 7.5 million registered voters showed Aylwin with 3.58 million votes, or 55.2 percent, enough for an absolute majority. Interior Ministry returns had Hernan Buchi, the former finance minister credited with designing a policy of economic growth and low inflation from 1985 until May, finishing a distant second with 1.9 million votes, or 29.4 percent.

But Vice President Dan Quayle, who attended Aylwin's March 11 inauguration in Santiago, said Pinochet assured him he would follow the policies of the new civilian government. The State Department said a review will open soon on Chile's petition for the restoration of easier tariff treatment of its exports and its request for renewed participation in the programs of the Overseas Private Investment Corp. Chile was suspended from participation in these programs in 1987 due to workers' rights issues, the department said.

THERE IS a little copper coin in Chile, the 10 peso piece, which depicts the angel of liberty snapping the chains of repression that for so long have bound her wrists. It does not commemorate Chile's return to democracy in 1990, after 17 years of military rule, but the coup of 1973 that brought the generals, led by Augusto Pinochet, to power. As Chile approaches the 20th anniversary of the coup of September 11, the coin remains a small but significant reminder of the fragile balance that exists between the civilian government and the military forces.

But Zaldivar, who spoke in an interview, and other Pinochet foes say most Chileans are still struggling to recover from a fierce recession in 1982, which they blame on a radical free market experiment launched after the coup and only later modified.

HISTORY Chile launched a struggle for independence from Spain on Sept. 18, 1810, and finally attained it in 1818, becoming a republic and establishing a reputation as one of Latin America's most stable democracies. Presidents were freely elected, even in 1881 during a victorious four year territorial war against neighboring Bolivia and Peru. Major political disturbances were historically rare, consisting of a brief civil war in 1891 and a series of coups in 1925.

Will it influence the start of yours? [Frei] It is a national problem.

Will it influence the start of yours? [Frei] It is a national problem. It does not involve an administration, it involves our country and it must be solved.

[Frei] It is a national problem. It does not involve an administration, it involves our country and it must be solved.

We will very strongly encourage the modernization of this company, which is a key company in the country. [De la Maza] When one views what happened in Codelco, one believes it maybe is without solution. It apparently involves a man who acting wrongly took the money of Chileans and in a nutshell speculated on the international markets and lost more than $200 million in just a few weeks.

It apparently involves a man who acting wrongly took the money of Chileans and in a nutshell speculated on the international markets and lost more than $200 million in just a few weeks. What can be done to prevent this type of action? [Frei] I believe there must be a control system.

What can be done to prevent this type of action? [Frei] I believe there must be a control system. Every company in the world ... [changes thought] I am also an entrepreneur, I have worked for many years in private companies.

[Frei] I believe there must be a control system. Every company in the world ... [changes thought] I am also an entrepreneur, I have worked for many years in private companies. There was no control.

Every company in the world ... [changes thought] I am also an entrepreneur, I have worked for many years in private companies. There was no control. We must find out why there was no control.

There was no control. We must find out why there was no control. Within the modernization process, we must clearly establish responsibilities and ensure that control is applied every day.
 FBIS3-10726 
We must find out why there was no control. Within the modernization process, we must clearly establish responsibilities and ensure that control is applied every day.

[De la Maza] It has been said recently that no one will pay for this loss, that Chileans will not have to pay it because there was some reserve money. Do you agree? [Frei] If Codelco receives less money in the next few years as future transactions are completed, it is obvious that Chile will receive less money.
 FBIS3-10726 
Do you agree? [Frei] If Codelco receives less money in the next few years as future transactions are completed, it is obvious that Chile will receive less money. [De la Maza] So all Chileans will have to pay for this loss in some way.

[De la Maza] So all Chileans will have to pay for this loss in some way. [Frei] Exactly. [De la Maza] It has also been said that the Codelco case negated the idea of loyal and constructive opposition to the administration of President Patricio Aylwin.

[De la Maza] The fact that this situation continues a situation that does not fully coincide with a democratic regime, along with the situation of appointed senators, etc. do you believe the transition is not fully completed?

The widow of Salvador Allende visited the president's unmarked grave Monday after returning from 15 years' forced exile, and tearfully thanked those who tended the site in her absence. Hortensia Bussi de Allende made the 75 mile trip from Santiago, the capital, to the Pacific coastal resort town of Vina del Mar with her two daughters, Isabel and Carmen, and a grandson, Gonzalo. Mrs. Allende, 74, spent a few minutes in silence before the gravestone, which carried only the name of a sister, Ines, and a brother in law.

Gen. Augusto Pinochet is taking his final bows, declaring democracy restored after a coup and more than 16 years in power, but the civilians who will follow him say the job has just begun. Pinochet says he is leaving a thriving, orderly nation to President elect Patricio Aylwin, who takes office March 11. We promised to restore democracy and we have done it, Pinochet said recently on a farewell tour of this narrow, 3,000 mile long nation on South America's west coast.
