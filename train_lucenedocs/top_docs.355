THE Inland Revenue says some 1.2m drivers would benefit under its proposals to restructure company car taxation but the 700,000 losers would face higher tax demands running to thousands of pounds a year in some cases. The Revenue emphasised yesterday that the proposals were only the start of a 3 1/2 month consultative process. It can expect to be inundated, for the issue is important for manufacturers, which make nearly a third of sales to business users, and for the government, which receives Pounds 1.4bn annually in income tax from the company car benefit scale charges, as well as for the nearly 2m company car users.

The proposals aim to make fairer what is essentially a crude banding system, unchanged in all essentials since it was introduced 16 years ago. But they are also intended to take account of criticisms, including some by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, that the combined price and engine capacity thresholds of the company car taxation system distort the market, obliging manufacturers to produce 'tax break specials' causing market bunching and potentially putting specialist manufacturers such as Jaguar at a disadvantage.

Jaguar PLC, a British luxury automaker, is looking to produce a less expensive model appealing to business executives if plans for cooperation with General Motors Corp. go through, a Jaguar executive said. An association with a large company like GM would enable us to look at the possibility of introducing a smaller Jaguar, an area in which as a small independent company we cannot consider as the investment and components cost would be too high, Jaguar's David Boole said Thursday. We want to look at other market opportunities and one of those is a downsized model in the $30,000 to $35,000 range, Boole said in a telephone interview from his home near the Jaguar plant at Coventry in the English Midlands.

DELIVERIES are beginning this week of the fastest and, at Pounds 350,000 each, the most expensive roadgoing Jaguar cars ever built. However, growing environmentalist sentiment and the difficulties some customers apparently face in paying for their cars make it almost certain that the 500 plus horsepower 212mph XJ220 is likely to be the first and last of its type to be offered under the Jaguar badge.

IN his budget speech next month Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected to indicate the extent to which the Inland Revenue's proposals for the reform of company car taxation, first outlined last summer, have been amended by criticism invited from the motor industry and other interested parties. The legislation to implement the revised tax regime will then be introduced in this year's Finance Act. But such are the complexities of change to PAYE systems, car makers' production and marketing strategies, for example that there will almost certainly be no attempt to introduce the changes before the start of the 1994 95 tax year.

Car makers were uneasy two years ago when the Inland Revenue unveiled its proposals for a new company car tax regime, based on a simple percentage of cars' list prices. In previous years considerable effort had gone into producing 'tax break specials' under the old tax regime, which heavily favoured high earning executives compared with lower paid essential users of company cars. The old system, based on price and engine capacity bands, meant that an executive driving a highly specified 'perk' car of fractionally under 2 litres and Pounds 19,250 paid only the same personal tax on his company car as an essential user of a utilitarian vehicle of just over 1.4 litres, provided their marginal tax rates were the same.

But transaction prices have not changed a lot because dealers were already giving away much of their official margin and relying on incentive bonuses from manufacturers to make a return on mainstream executive cars.

During the closure, the company will retool the plant for styling changes in the new fall model of the Cadillac Eldorado, which the plant builds in addition to several other GM luxury models, including the Cadillac Seville, Oldsmobile Toronado and Buick Riviera. Stopping production of these 1987 models earlier than planned represents a setback for the company. When GM introduced the front wheel drive models in the fall of 1985, they were hailed as vehicles that would keep GM strong in the expensive car market for years.

For next year, Mr. Reitman forecasts 80 marks a share but says that could be low; Ms. Bottenbruch looks for 85 marks to 90 marks a share. At yesterday's closing price of 1232 marks, Porsche is trading at about 17.5 times its expected 1990 earnings. The Porsche shares that trade on the Frankfurt exchange are non voting preference shares; voting control is held by members of the Porsche and Piech families.

THE TAKEOVER of Group Lotus by Bugatti brings together two of the most famous motor racing names of the pre war and post war eras. Ettore Bugatti, the Italian creator of some of the world's most beautiful classic cars, died in 1947, and his car factory in France had already ceased production by the early 1950s in the aftermath of the war. In the UK Colin Chapman, the Group Lotus founder and one of the most creative and successful designers of racing cars, started his business in the early 1950s.

In the table, column A represents the costs that might be incurred by a company in providing a car for an employee's private and business use, together with the resulting tax liability for the employee. Column B analyses the same costs of motoring from the company's and employee's positions, as if the employee had been reimbursed with the running costs in column B. Column C indicates the amount of any salary increase and in some cases deduction necessary for the employee to be left neither better nor worse off by being paid cash.

Column C indicates the amount of any salary increase and in some cases deduction necessary for the employee to be left neither better nor worse off by being paid cash.

Another battle in the automotive warranty war may be on the horizon after a nearly three year cease fire and the front may be on America's highways instead of at dealership service departments. In early 1987, the nation's Big Three automakers extended existing warranties and used the new guarantees as bait to snare new car buyers. On Thursday, Oldsmobile took a page from the European luxury car makers' warranty book and introduced a new three part program for 1990 Oldsmobile buyers.

French auto maker Peugeot S.A.'s U.S. sales unit said the weak U.S. dollar accounted for most of its 4.7%, or $988, average price increase. The least expensive Peugeot, the 505 DL, will start at $15,495 when it goes on sale next month with the rest of Peugeot's 1988 product line. The company also increased destination charges on all cars by $10, to $385.

IN an ideal world, all the new cars which will make their debut at Frankfurt and Tokyo motor shows would have been designed simply and solely as safe, economical personal transport making the minimum impact on the environment. Some of them have although they are mainly concept cars which may or may not go into production. In the meantime, conventional cars with potential maximum speeds exploitable only at rare intervals on the de restricted parts of Germany's autobahnen are alive and multiplying.

Jaguar today unveils its new XJ range of luxury saloons, the first of a series of three new cars planned for launch in the next four years, and aimed at transforming the fortunes of the chronically loss making UK luxury carmaker. Jaguar has suffered total pre tax losses of Pounds 776m since it was taken over for Pounds 1.56bn in late 1989 by Ford, the world's second biggest vehicle producer. The US carmaker is doubling its stakes rather than quitting, however, and expects to have invested another Pounds 1bn by the end of 1996.

Whether it will be worthwhile depends on each individual's circumstances and will need precise calculation.

For the moment at least, what those buyers will like remains a matter of important guesswork for manufacturers seeking to determine what their future model line ups should be.

But the driver of a Saab 9000 CSE 2.0i with a list price of Pounds 20,245 will see a fall of Pounds 594.

So far, aluminium has provided the main bodywork only for expensive, limited production cars such as Aston Martin or Honda's NSX sports car. But the next substantive move towards wider adoption by vehicle manufacturers is imminent, within the next few months, with the launch by Audi of its replacement for the V8 saloon and which will have an aluminium chassis.

From 1994 95 the scale charge on a Pounds 100,000 Rolls will be Pounds 35,000.

Critics say the new system could destroy the 'supercar' market embodied by vehicles such as Jaguar's Pounds 415,000 XJ220, which will incur a scale charge of nearly Pounds 150,000 as a 'perk'.

The ZR1 costs $31,683 more than the $32,455 Corvette. That's mainly because of the ZR1's 32 valve, eight cylinder aluminum engine, which can fling the car from 0 to 60 miles per hour in just 4.3 seconds. The regular Corvette has a cast iron eight cylinder engine that produces 245 horsepower and takes an additional 1.4 seconds to get from 0 to 60 miles per hour.
