It was a grim coincidence that the first comprehensive exhibition of artefacts recovered from the Titanic opened at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich a few days after the sinking of the ferry Estonia. The fascination surrounding the loss of the supposedly unsinkable Titanic, on its maiden voyage, was overshadowed by the shock of the sinking of a modern ferry at a cost of more than 900 lives. The Titanic went down after it struck an iceberg off Newfoundland on April 14, 1912.

Argo and his master, expedition leader Dr. Robert Ballard, also discovered the sunken Titanic four years ago. The Bismarck was sitting upright on the sea floor intact in an excellent state of preservation about 600 miles west of Brest on the Brittany coast, said Ballard, who is based at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod.

As for wrecks from the dim reaches of the past, Ballard argues that they should be explored only by qualified archeologists intent on broadening historical knowledge. In fact, he still becomes visibly angry that private expeditions to the Titanic took some artifacts from the wreck.

Ballard said Thursday. During a 90 minute news conference, Ballard described how he his ocean crawling robot located the Bismarck sitting upright and proud two weeks ago. Then the American oceanographer, whose father was of British background and whose mother was of German heritage, addressed himself to the German people in German.

Built for 300 passengers and a crew of 76, the steamship was carrying more than 2,300 people plus 100 horses and mules when three of its four boilers exploded at 2 a.m. on April 27, 1865. Jerry Potter, a Memphis lawyer who has researched the disaster for a dozen years and is writing a book on it, said Union officers may have overloaded the paddlewheeler to inflate troop transport payments.

An inquiry will be held into the conduct of a steamship captain who was criticized for not coming to the aid of the Titanic when it sank 78 years ago, the government said Monday. The Titanic sank after striking an iceberg in the North Atlantic on April 14, 1912. More than 1,500 of the 2,200 people aboard the ship perished.

Underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard, whose deep sea robot discovered the German battleship Bismarck on the bottom of the Atlantic two weeks ago, said today he believed the World War II vessel had been scuttled by its own crew. At a news conference to disclose details of the discovery, Ballard said the condition of the ship confirmed for him the theory that the vessel was scuttled rather than sunk by British fire in one of the most famous and important naval engagements of the war. Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one piece, Ballard said.

The sinking occurred only eight days after the Bismarck left Gydnia, Poland, for her first operation, intended to attack convoys of merchant shipping and damage British morale at a time when England stood virtually alone against combined German sea and air power. The British sent the warship Hood after the Bismarck, but five days after the Bismarck went to sea it sank the Hood with the loss of all but three of the British vessel's crew of 1,419. The Hood was the largest warship in the world until the start of World War II and symbolized British sea power, so its loss stunned the British public and the war government and made sinking the Bismarck a mission of the most crucial nature.

A pioneering space probe suggested Saturn's largest moon might be covered with an ocean of liquid natural gas, but scientists who bounced radar off its surface say it may have some dry land or an icy surface. We interpret our results to mean that the surface of Titan is highly variable, planetary scientist Duane O. Muhleman said in an announcement issued Monday by the California Institute of Technology. Titan, nearly twice as massive as Earth's moon, is one of only three moons in the solar system known to have atmospheres.

Titan, nearly twice as massive as Earth's moon, is one of only three moons in the solar system known to have atmospheres. The others are Jupiter's moon Io and Neptune's moon Triton. Data from Voyager 1 in 1980 suggested that methane and ethane, components of natural gas, condense in Titan's mostly nitrogen atmosphere and rain on the surface, leading some scientists to believe Titan might be covered by up to a mile of liquid ethane and methane.

The Bismarck sank the British battle cruiser Hood on May 24, 1941, but two days later British torpedo planes damaged the ship's steering gear and rudders.

World shipping leaders have given the go ahead for the introduction of new, automatic communications that will mean the end of the Morse code for ships at sea. The Global Maritime Distress and Safety System transmits and receives automatically, so Morse will no longer be a requirement for ships. Shipowners are expected to phase out radio operators when the new equipment is installed in ships, starting in 1993.

The captain of a ship which was near the sinking Titanic in 1912 could have done nothing to save the 1,490 people who died, an official UK inquiry concluded. But it criticised Captain Stanley Lord (left) for not responding to the luxury liner's distress signals. Capt Lord, censured by a 1912 inquiry, died in 1962 but supporters have fought to clear his name.

Europe and the United States plan to send a space probe to Titan, the solar system's biggest moon and the only one with an atmosphere much like primordial Earth's, the European Space Agency announced Friday. The joint mission to Saturn's immense, gas shrouded satellite would begin in 1996 and include a lunar probe that may be able to test soil from the mysterious moon. The mission, to be called the Cassini Titan probe, was chosen from a series of proposed joint projects during meetings Thursday and Friday of the European Space Agency's Science Program Committee.

Jason, the million dollar submersible robot, was still missing at sea Friday but its disappearance failed to sink a $7 million high school science project. Jason's still down there, but we're optimistic, said Nancy Green of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, home base to the propeller driven remote control robot sunk to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. More than 250,000 students in 13 cities in the United States and Canada were boning up on plate tectonics and underwater volcanoes in preparation for the start Monday of a massive satellite science project gone slightly awry.

A Titan 4, America's newest, most powerful rocket, blasted off on its maiden flight today, reportedly sending into space a $180 million satellite designed to provide instant alert of a missile attack. It was the most expensive unmanned space mission ever by the United States, with the $220 million rocket, a $45 million satellite booster stage and other costs raising the total pricetag to close to half a billion dollars. The 20 story tall booster barreled off its launch pad at 9:18 a.m. and spewed a long tail of fire and smoke from its twin solid fuel boosters as it dashed out over the Atlantic Ocean.

Newport said any chance of establishing what really happened depends on finding the hatch door, where the explosives' detonator was mounted. But the findings might be inconclusive, he said, because the detonator switch could have been flipped by some force other than Grissom, such as a powerful vacuum created during re entry.

Federal safety investigators are blaming the boat accident deaths of four people in Oregon last year on the Coast Guard's failure to require lifeboats and a signal beacon on the vessel that carried them. The National Transportation Safety Board has tried for years to get the Coast Guard to toughen requirements for an estimated 4,700 small commercial vessels that are equipped to carry 300,000 passengers. There has been a long, documented absence of regulatory action, said board member Jim Burnett.

The board for years has recommended that the Coast Guard require all passenger boats to carry lifeboats that will keep all passengers and crew out of the water if the ship sinks and that emergency position indicating radio beacons, or EPRIBs, be carried on all vessels so they can be quickly located by searchers.

The Earth's slowly rising temperature may be to blame for the recent increase in icebergs breaking off from Antarctica, government ice specialists say. They can't be sure yet, but officials of the Navy NOAA Joint Ice Center note that as the global temperature has increased, so have the size and number of icebergs. An abnormally high amount of ice shelf calving is occurring in Antarctica, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorologist Glenn Rutledge said Thursday.

At least 50 nuclear weapons and nine nuclear reactors, the products of U.S. and Soviet naval accidents since World War II, are lost on the ocean floor, Greenpeace officials said Tuesday. There are more likely more Soviet weapons and reactors on the bottom of the ocean, said William M. Arkin, co author of the report by the Greenpeace environmental group, which favors nuclear free seas, and the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal research group. Using data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, the groups found that more than 2,000 major peacetime naval accidents have occurred since 1945 resulting in some 2,800 deaths.

The discoverers of the sunken Titanic announced a venture Wednesday designed to bring undersea exploration of a Roman shipwreck to thousands of students across the country via live television. Robert Ballard, who led the team that found the Titanic in 1985, said students, linked by satellite to at least nine science museums in the United States and Canada, will be able to communicate with explorers directing an unmanned mobile camera as it combs the Mediterranean Sea floor. While the $6 million, privately funded project involves several advances in technology, Ballard said its main purpose is to excite students about science.

The satellite is the first of a new class that uses an infrared telescope to detect an all out nuclear missile attack on the United States within a minute of launch, said John Pike, associate director of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists.
