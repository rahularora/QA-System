Except in her exquisite, if expressionless, face, the Amazonian Ms. Guillem shows none of the feminine grace usually associated with classical ballet. Broad shouldered, hyper extended and commandingly tall, she nonetheless adopts a shy and modest demeanor that contrasts disconcertingly with the force of her dancing and the implicit willpower it expresses. In tackling parts like the mischievous innkeeper's daughter in Don Quixote and the remote but passionate temple dancer in La Bayadere, she offers less a portrayal than an impersonation.

Let's hope that the gala performance by American Ballet Theater that opened the First New York International Festival of the Arts on Saturday was not a paradigm for the entire monthlong celebration. Though the evening got off to a brilliant start with Mark Morris's Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes, it then, suddenly and irrevocably, fell flat on its face. The problem, as usual, was the choreography on this occasion, two works new to the ABT repertory: Antony Tudor's Fandango, originally created 25 years ago for the long vanished Metropolitan Opera Ballet Company; and Clark Tippet's S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A, a world premiere.

Or the 21 year old Julio Bocca, whose gifts are simply prodigious. What the Soviet performer has over his ABT counterparts, however, is coaching. When Mr. Bocca appeared as Albrecht during the last week of the season, his dancing, though breathtaking, had nothing to do with his characterization, or even with the way he presented himself to the audience.

New York City Ballet's Balanchine Celebration, about which Clement Crisp wrote in its early stages, came to a triumphant end on Sunday with a gala performance that began at 4 in the afternoon and lasted until 10.30 in the evening, with intermissions when cocktails and zakouski (Russian hors d'oeuvres) or American dessert (brownies and carrot cake) were served, and a longer break when you could get a box supper prepared according to Balanchine's own recipes. As for the dancing, the programme reprised the chronological format of the season as a whole, but with an international flavour to illustrate the fact that Balanchine generously gave his ballets to companies all over the world. Guest artists from the Kirov, the Paris Opera, the Royal Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Dance Theatre of Harlem, San Francisco Ballet, and Pacific Northwest Ballet (Seattle) appeared alongside City Ballet dancers.

To this end, they have repudiated Mr. Baryshnikov's attempts to create a genuine ensemble in place of what was essentially a showcase for visiting stars; his efforts to extend the company's artistic reach by engaging modern dance choreographers such as Merce Cunningham, Twyla Tharp, Karole Armitage and Mark Morris; his partiality for the ballets of George Balanchine; his determination to place greater emphasis on classical than on demi caractere dancing. While there hasn't been enough time for the new administration to eradicate all evidence of its predecessor's taste the general outlines of ABT's current season at the Metropolitan Opera House were devised by Mr. Baryshnikov before his precipitous departure the artistic orientation of Ms. Hermann and Mr. Smith has begun to manifest itself. For one thing, guest artists, abjured for the most part since 1980, are again very much in evidence.

Where Mr. Martinez has created his own choreography, as in the last act solos and ensembles, the result is oppressive. Oppressive, too, is the scenery. Mr. Straiges's folksy and ill drawn set for the first and third acts is banal to a point of invisibility.

Oppressive, too, is the scenery. Mr. Straiges's folksy and ill drawn set for the first and third acts is banal to a point of invisibility. In what looks like an attempt to give it some substance, the designer has surrounded it with a wide, dark green border, a heavy handed device at odds with the buoyant music of Delibes.

A University of Oregon senior faces a contempt of court charge for enclosing a letter with a parking fine in which he complained in mostly vulgar terms about having to pay. Jeffrey Sebastian, 23, said he was angry about the fine because he received the parking ticket while taking a required exam. He suggested, in a letter peppered mostly with profanities, that the city should coordinate parking with the school when exams are scheduled.

[Miglio] Regionalism will not alter the situation much, because even if it is implemented, it will merely increase the influence of the welfare state...

Now, however, I realize that I made a mistake, like inspector Rock on that television commercial many years ago. To have imagined a different order for Italy the federal order.

A jury has concluded that a defective football helmet allowed a former high school athlete to suffer a severe brain injury and has awarded the young man $11.2 million. The helmet made by the Bike Athletic Co. was unreasonably dangerous, leading to acute bleeding within the brain of Richard Austria, then 16, a Multnomah County Circuit Court jury decided Monday in an 11 1 vote. Austria, now 20, has severe, irreversible mental and physical impairments and requires 24 hour care.

A dancer's life is short, and youthful promise has a nasty habit of fading away, either by reason of neglect or because of the pressures within a ballet company. The golden gift we saw at graduation or thought we saw turns to some baser material as time passes, and occasional soloist roles are the reward for what once seemed a talent to storm the heights. The Paris Opera Ballet has in latter years set aside evenings in the Palais Garnier to celebrate the potential of its youngest dancers, so that the Paris public (always very partisan) may judge the gifted young, and the gifted young may have moments of glory as a reward for talent, and a taste of greater rewards to come.

A dancer's life is short, and youthful promise has a nasty habit of fading away, either by reason of neglect or because of the pressures within a ballet company. The golden gift we saw at graduation or thought we saw turns to some baser material as time passes, and occasional soloist roles are the reward for what once seemed a talent to storm the heights. The Paris Opera Ballet has in latter years set aside evenings in the Palais Garnier to celebrate the potential of its youngest dancers, so that the Paris public (always very partisan) may judge the gifted young, and the gifted young may have moments of glory as a reward for talent, and a taste of greater rewards to come.

The division of dance interest the passionate Gamzatti given the bravura Grand Pas; the 'holy' Nikiya rewarded with the Shades scene reveals Petipa's astute sense of theatre. Solor is a numbskull, but a tormented one, and the part rewards bold playing as Mukhamedov, Bocca and Manuel Legris have variously shown us. The technical demands of the Grand Pas and the Shades sequence are among the greatest in 19th century ballet, and Petipa's dramatic skill can be seen in the hallucinatory entry of the Shades as in the spacious exposition of narrative.
