Managers of a sewage treatment plant in south east Australia are considering plans to turn it into a tourist attraction. The 10,851 ha plant which produces more beef than any farm in the region treats 55 per cent of the wastewater generated by the city of Melbourne. Natural purification methods rather than chemical treatment are used to produce effluent, which is deposited in Port Phillip Bay.

If another company wins the race for News Corp.'s television stations, that bidder is expected to team with Mr. Stokes to form the third network. The two News Corp. stations are expected to be sold for a total of about $502.4 million. The carving up of Herald was sparked in part by a government proposal to liberalize laws that currently limit a company to owning only two television stations.

Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman, and Circus Circus, the large US gaming group, yesterday lost their joint bid to build the USDollars 1bn plus Sydney casino complex, which is forecast to have annual gaming revenues of around ADollars 500m (USDollars 357.1m) when it comes on stream in 1997. Instead, the New South Wales Casino Control Authority announced yesterday the winning development proposal had been submitted by Leighton Holdings, the stock market listed Australian engineering and construction group in which Hochtief, the German construction group, has a 48 per cent shareholding. Although the CCA stressed no one factor had influenced its decision, the Leighton bid made in conjunction with Showboat, a US casino group offered a much higher upfront payment to the NSW state in return for the casino licence.

Peugeot announced last Tuesday that it is switching its engines from McLaren to Jordan for 1995. This was brought about by one of the biggest motor racing alliances for many a year, in which Mercedes engines are to be used by the McLaren team. The German manufacturer already supplies race engines to the Penske team for US IndyCar events, and both Penske and McLaren are sponsored by Marlboro.

The German manufacturer already supplies race engines to the Penske team for US IndyCar events, and both Penske and McLaren are sponsored by Marlboro. The strong tip is that Mercedes' agreement with the British team will also involve a commitment to the IndyCar series, and that Schumacher will join McLaren when his contract with Benetton finishes next year.

THERE used to be a grassy mound more or less opposite the pavilion at the Sydney cricket ground. They called it The Hill, and for generations of working class Sydneysiders it was a second home for the five days a year when Australia met its touring opponents in the Sydney Test match. By all accounts they were a rough lot on The Hill, but they knew about cricket.

FOR the third consecutive year, the annual Test match at the Sydney Cricket Ground faded into a draw, but not without destroying a couple of long standing myths. By the time Brian Lara wrapped up the match on Wednesday afternoon with a couple of overs of wobbly leg spin including a googly which the hapless Mark Taylor failed to pick up Australia and the West Indies had racked up 1,226 runs, in spite of frequent interruptions for rain. It was a heart stirring display batting exhibition, which included six 50s and three centuries, capped by Lara's imperious 277, widely lauded as one of the best knocks ever seen at Sydney.

The experience will have been less uplifting for the Australians, and it must have been particularly difficult for Warne, who finished with one wicket for 116 off 41 overs his single scalp the wicket of the struggling Hooper, who continues to promise more than he delivers. However, Warne may benefit in the long run if his failure lowers the expectations raised by his seven for 52 in Melbourne. That performance made him the latest candidate for the mantle of Clarrie Grimmett, the best in a long line of match winning Australian leg spinners the last of whom was Richie Benaud in the 1960s.

However, Sydney has raised two big question marks about the slow men: will Warne's promise fade on less accommodating pitches in New Zealand and England later this year; and why does the West Indies no longer produce spinners of the calibre of Lance Gibbs, Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine?

BFN [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Senator Gareth Evans, has called on Asia Pacific region countries to put pressure on North Korea to stop its nuclear weapons program. Speaking at the ninth Pacific Basin Nuclear Conference in Sydney, Senator Evans said the situation in North Korea was worrying, but not at crisis point. He said a nuclear armed North Korea would undermine confidence in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] and present a serious security threat to the region.

He said a nuclear armed North Korea would undermine confidence in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] and present a serious security threat to the region. [Begin Evans recording] For the North Koreans, the choice is really a pretty straightforward and simple one to remain in the NPT and accept the disciplines of the treaty, including full IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] safeguards, or, alternatively, it can continue with its nuclear activities in violation of its treaty obligations and face not only almost universal international censure, but, in time, a package of severe and damaging sanctions.

The lawmakers from the governing Nationalist Party said, We should suspend our policy of opening up toward the mainland until the Chinese Communists lift martial law and end any military crackdown. They said they will submit their statement to the Legislative Yuan (parliament) for discussion Tuesday and then relay it to the Cabinet.
