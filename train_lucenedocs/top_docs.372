The 87 people who died in a social club fire were martyrs to the quest for a better life, just like 146 people killed exactly 79 years earlier in a fire in a city garment factory, Mayor David Dinkins said Monday. Dinkins told about 700 people at a memorial service for victims of the 1911 fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. that both tragedies killed immigrants looking for improved living conditions in America. With vicious irony yesterday, on the 79th anniversary of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, history repeated itself, the mayor said at the site of the earlier blaze.

On Sunday, the bodies of trapped revelers were found packed into the Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx. A Cuban immigrant was charged with setting fire to the club's only exit after he was thrown out. Authorities said the club's patrons never had a chance to escape the blaze because the building did not follow fire codes.

The fire occurred early Sunday as the club's patrons, many of them Honduran immigrants, danced and drank liquor in a building that lacked a liquor license and violated much of the fire code. Julio Gonzalez, 36, was charged with 87 counts of felony murder, 87 counts of murder through depraved indifference and one count of attempted murder and arson. Police said he had argued with his former girlfriend, a worker at the club.

Chicago and several New Jersey cities have begun cracking down on illegal social clubs like New York's Happy Land, the firetrap where 87 people died in a gasoline fed blaze. Officials in many cities around the nation say they don't have such clubs, which typically operate without licenses and stay open after hours. But in those cities that do, Sunday's fire sent a cautionary message.
