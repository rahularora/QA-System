An animal with eyes on stalks and lots of legs will terrify people even if humans are thousands of times bigger and heavier, but such is our anthropomorphism that a much bigger animal will cause cooings of delight if it simply does something supposedly characteristic of humans. Hence the appeal of the meerkat, which looks like a cross between a dog and a monkey and stands on its hind legs to watch for predators. 'Meerkats United' is repeated today in David Attenborough's Wildlife 100 collection (7.00 BBC1).

The zoo was renovated after it lost accreditation amid grisly stories of animal abuse. Where we can put animals on grass with natural foliage, fresh, bubbling water and open sky, it makes us feel a whole lot better and as far as I know, the animals like it better, said Gerald S. Lentz, zoological manager of Busch Gardens, which boasts 21 Asian elephants and other endangered species among its 3,300 mammals, birds and reptiles. Such amenities are necessary: zoos must breed more endangered species while at the same time captivating public sentiment for that cause.

In the second place, London Zoo is architecturally significant. It is chock full of protected, listed buildings. When I visited the zoo recently, the koala bears who now inhabit Bertold Lubertkin's listed Gorilla House (1933) were as somnolent as ever, and the penguins in the same architect's listed abstract sculptural Penguin Pool (1934) seemed to be suffering as much as the visitors from the unseasonable June chill.

A wallaroo that was apparently not in the mood for mating may have set a new high jump record when it escaped from the Walk in the Wild Zoo by leaping a 7 foot fence. The animal's caretaker, Mike Cassell, said he was putting a female wallaroo a cross between a kangaroo and a wallaby inside a wire enclosure housing a male wallaroo at the zoo when the male escaped Friday afternoon. Cassell, other zoo workers and Spokane County Animal Control employees searched for the 3 foot tall, dark gray animal in the brushy areas along the Spokane River before it was finally cornered in the front yard of a residence about two miles from the zoo.

<P> Keeping tarantulas cool was not something architects John Grist and Ara Zenobians had ever had to plan for in their work on Southland hotels, shopping centers and upscale homes. </P> <P> But they were hired to be flexible, think simple and work fast on what would be the most primitive looking project in their portfolio the new Los Angeles children's zoo, which opens Friday at 10 a.m. </P> <P> It was a stretch in one sense, Grist said recently as workers prepared Adventure Island for the arrival of its first tenants. We had to do a lot of research, but architects being the egotists that they are, think they can do anything.

Ms. Dresser said the center has been studying cats for several years to learn more about their reproduction for such a transfer. Eggs and sperm were gathered from desert cats, the eggs were fertilized in a glass dish, and the embryos were implanted in the domestic cat. Two embryos survived, but one of the kittens was born dead.

Even if Mrs. Goins misses all five free throws, she will still take home $10,000.

Illegal trade in endangered or protected wildlife such as crocodiles, parrots and chimpanzees represents an estimated $1.5 billion annually, an official responsible for enforcing an international treaty protecting such species said Thursday. Illicit commerce in wildlife tends to increase during the summer and Christmas holiday seasons because customs officials are often overloaded and illegal shipments slip past them, Jean Patrick Le Duc told a news conference. Also, at Christmas, live animals make good presents, he said.

Zoo pathologists see to it, by preserving a piece of all the animal's organs in a large jar for future research. A back room in the clinic is a veritable library of animal organs, with jars going back as far as 20 years. In a bizarre twist, death has made neighbors of Jackson's Hartebeest, 5 691, Hispaniolan Boa, '87 and Sea Lion, 10 10 90 all of which are grouped on neighboring shelves, a stone's throw from the bottled reproductive tract of a wisent (the nearly extinct European bison).

In a lush patch of Brazilian rainforest a group of golden lion tamarins discover the joys of swinging between trees. Brought up in the Los Angeles zoo and recently introduced to the wild, they form part of one of the world's most successful experiments in saving a species from extinction. The project brings together first and third world nations, private and public sectors, environmentalists and farmers, as well as several scientific disciplines.
