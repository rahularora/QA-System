Nevertheless, there are a lot of people who don't want to have anything to do with the guy (Mr. Goodman). I sometimes wonder whether people are afraid of him because he's two steps ahead of them, says John Embry, a vice president of Toronto based Royal Bank Investment Management, which holds about 4% of the Corona Class A shares. Although he backs Mr. Goodman's proposals to acquire Eskay Creek and restructure Corona, Mr. Embry says he remains concerned Corona will continue to control the new gold unit with a 50.2% holding.

Corona put a value of 281.4 million Canadian dollars (US$244.8 million) on its non gold assets. Analysts said the restructuring likely would bolster the market valuation of Corona's gold assets, making it easier for the company to raise equity financing to develop its next big gold project, the Eskay Creek deposit in northern British Columbia. They said the improved investor opinion would reflect in part the company's plans to abandon its much criticized multiple share structure, which gives Mr. Goodman and a few associates control of 70% of the votes in Corona with less than 4% of the equity.

Newmont Mining Corp. is negotiating with a syndicate of international banks to arrange a million ounce gold loan, more than twice the size of any existing gold based loan, bank and investment executives said. In trading late Friday on the London Metal Exchange the spot price of gold was quoted at $477 an ounce, giving Newmont's planned loan an indicated value of $477 million.

The Ontario Supreme Court dismissed a bid by LAC Minerals Ltd. for a new trial to determine ownership of the disputed Page Williams gold mine, which the court awarded in 1986 to a predecessor of Corona Corp.

Justice Osborne disclosed his decision privately to attorneys yesterday, following a hearing that ended last week.

For Homestake, which operates the oldest gold mine in the U.S., a link with Corona would provide additional gold reserves that are relatively cheap to mine, analysts say. At the same time, a merger would help Corona clean up its debt heavy balance sheet and give it the financial muscle to develop its rich Eskay Creek gold prospect in British Columbia.
