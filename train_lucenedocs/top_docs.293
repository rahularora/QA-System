A twin engine plane with 11 people aboard disappeared on what was to have been an hourlong tour of the Hawaiian Islands, and searchers used helicopters and boats to look for the plane, the Coast Guard said today. The U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Point Harris searched overnight through the channel separating Hawaii Island and Maui Island for the Scenic Air Tour Hawaii plane that disappeared Sunday afternoon. The Coast Guard was concentrating its search for the plane off the northeast coast of Hawaii Island, the last confirmed location of the airplane, said Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer Robert Bennett.

A sightseeing plane that vanished between the islands of Hawaii and Maui with 11 people aboard may have sent out an emergency signal Monday, but foul weather prevented rescuers from searching for it. There's an emergency signal coming from valley and we think it could be the plane, said Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler. But the weather's so bad helicopters can't go in, and otherwise it's about a 10 hour hike.

The plane's last reported position was 10 miles north of Hilo and flying at 2,000 feet, according to Federal Aviation Administration spokesman George Harvey. The plane passed out of radar contact at that point and would not have re emerged on radar until it passed the island's northern tip.

Hawaii has the nation's lowest rate of preventable deaths from chronic diseases and Michigan has the highest, the federal Centers for Disease Control said Wednesday. The CDC found that the 50 states and the District of Columbia could have prevented at least 26 percent of their deaths from nine leading chronic diseases in 1986 by reducing such risks as smoking and cholesterol levels. The bottom line is there are a lot of these deaths that are potentially preventable, said Steven M. Teutsch, a CDC epidemiologist who helped research the study.

A grave discovered on a small, uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands was believed to contain the remains of one of five Hawaii fishermen who disappeared nearly 10 years ago, authorities said. The grave and what remained of the men's 17 foot fiberglass boat, the Sarah Joe, were found on Sibylla Island last month by a U.S. National Marine Fisheries worker and an archaeologist studying green turtles and sea birds, Coast Guard Capt. Jim Cushman said Wednesday.

Magdalena Barut didn't need the money, but she was bored; tired of just chasing the chickens around the yard of the Maui home she has lived in since 1954.

But not only has McDonald's hired Barut and other senior citizens like her, the nationwide hamburger chain also lets them pick their own shifts, gives them 20 hours of training for just one task Barut learned to make french fries and in some cases drives them to and from work.

Hawaiian folklore tells of the movements of the volcano goddess Pele from one island to another. Without knowing it, the tellers of these tales were chronicling the scientific process that formed the Hawaiian archipelago. Legend has it that Pele was being chased from island to island by her sister and nemesis, Na Maka o Kahai, goddess of the sea.

This hot spot remelts the portion of the rock passing over it, creating magma. The intense heat forces the magma to rise through the crust. The new magma builds on the previous eruptions in a layered fashion to form massive undersea mountains whose tips eventually rise above sea level and become islands, he said.

As the Juan de Fuca plate is pushed deeper into the earth, the friction melts the rock to form highly pressurized magma that can be released with explosive force, Okamura said.

A partial list of the 95 people aboard Aloha Airlines Flight 243, which was blown apart last Thursday during a flight from Hilo to Honolulu, was released Tuesday by state Attorney General Warren Price. Aloha had repeatedly refused to release the names of the 89 passengers on board the ill fated flight, saying it wanted to protect them from unsolicited legal advice and to protect their privacy. The names of pilot Robert Schornstheimer, co pilot Mimi Tompkins and flight attendants Michelle Honda, Jane Sato Tomita, and Clarabelle Lansing, who was killed, were released last Thursday.

A Honolulu bound jumbo jet with 205 people aboard developed a fuel leak over the Pacific Ocean, but landed safely early Monday after being diverted to Hilo, authorities said. Pilots shut down the TWA airliner's left wing engine when fuel began leaking from the wing, said Don Morrison, an airline spokesman in St. Louis. The captain was not able to do anything to stop the leak, and made a precautionary landing in Hilo, Morrison said.

Jurigi Co. of Japan agreed to pay Honolulu $111 million for a just completed $40 million municipal golf course near Pearl Harbor and $200 million more in community impact fees for permission to build two more courses on Oahu, where Honolulu is located. The City Council rejected the proposal, but its chairman, Arnold Morgado, agrees with the concept. In September, Morgado, the governor and the mayor said golf courses take up land that could be used for housing, and require large tracts of undeveloped land at or near locations which have scenic, recreational or cultural significance to the community.

At 2 a.m. today (8 a.m. EDT) the storm's center was 530 miles east southeast of Hilo and 740 miles east southeast of Honolulu, with a course and speed that would bring it just south of Hawaii, the southernmost island in the chain, on Friday. If the course and speed remained unchanged, it would be near Oahu, the most populous island of 850,000 where Honolulu is located, on Saturday, forecasters said.
