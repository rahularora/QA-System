San Francisco Bay area residents were jolted awake Tuesday by a sharp earthquake that broke windows, toppled groceries and startled a man into falling to his death from a fifth story apartment window. The quake occurred as state and federal emergency services officials prepared to conduct a two day test of their response to a catastrophic earthquake. The quake, which hit with a jolt and rolled for 10 seconds, caused only minor structural damage, but was felt as far away as San Luis Obispo, about 230 miles south of San Francisco and in Sonoma County, 60 miles to the north.

Also Monday, the governor fired Ian Buckle, the earthquake expert hired to probe the the I 880 collapse, saying his defense of the state transportation department in an op ed article jeopardized the inquiry's impartiality. Two more deaths were reported in San Francisco, and in the beach town of Bonny Doon, Calif., north of Santa Cruz, workers uncovered the body of 41 year old man, identified as Gary Phillip West, buried by a landslide during the quake.

A slightly increased risk of a severe earthquake exists in an area south of San Francisco that was jolted by a moderate temblor this week, say state officials who also caution against public alarm. California's Office of Emergency Services issued an advisory Tuesday saying that for the next five days, the slightly increased likelihood for continued seismic activity was possible for the region rocked by Monday's earthquake, which scientists estimated at between 5.0 and 5.7 on the Richter scale. Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, University of California, Berkeley, and the state Division of Mines and Geology say that this activity could involve an earthquake as large as 6.5 Richter magnitude, although it's not probable that a quake of this size will occur, the advisory said.

Most small buildings and homes throughout the Bay area also survived with little or no damage, unlike those that crumbled in Soviet Armenia when a similar 6.9 magnitude quake struck last December and left 25,000 people dead and tens of thousands homeless. The economic toll of the California quake is already estimated at $4 billion and, according to Frank McCormick, a top economist for the Bank of America in San Francisco, is likely to reach $10 billion. But that represents only about a month's worth of the Bay area's $125 billion annual economy, he said, and will be offset quickly by a boost to the economy from reconstruction jobs, insurance payments and federal assistance.

Many residents of the town of 30,000, part of California's salad bowl region where much of the nation's lettuce, asparagus and artichokes are grown, spread across lawns and vacant lots like refugees. We're talking about people with no resources, no money for food and no money for health care, said Barbara Garcia, executive director of Salud Pera La Gente, a state financed community clinic.

Tuesday night, thousands were diverted to other airports and had to wait a day to resume travel. Runways at San Francisco weren't damaged, but traffic was being limited yesterday to 27 arrivals and 27 departures an hour down from 33 to 45 an hour normally mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows, an FAA spokeswoman said. While the airport was closed, flights were diverted to airports in Sacramento and Stockton, Calif.; Reno and Las Vegas, Nev.; and Los Angeles.

While the airport was closed, flights were diverted to airports in Sacramento and Stockton, Calif.; Reno and Las Vegas, Nev.; and Los Angeles. United Airlines, the largest carrier at San Francisco, was operating only 50% of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal, which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the Bay area.

Physical and emotional scars persist six months after the killer earthquake jolted the San Francisco Bay area, but most businesses and residents are back on solid ground. Economic activity has nearly regained its pre quake level, analysts say, and estimates of the cost of damage caused by the massive temblor have been scaled back. The damage is widespread, nevertheless.

The devastating earthquake that killed hundreds in northern California vividly recalls the catastrophic quake and fire that laid waste to San Francisco in 1906. Quakes are almost commonplace in California, with that state and western Nevada experiencing 90 percent of the tremors recorded in this country according to the U.S. Geological Survey. But when the rare major quake comes, as it did in the nation's second deadliest quake on Tuesday, serious damage can result as well as death and injury.
