Fifth grade teacher Susan Nardinger is rallying the faithful in this river city to defend its short reputation, which has been assaulted once again by river rats in Lincoln City, Ore. Students in Nardinger's class touched off the battle two years ago, when they petitioned the Guinness Book of World Records to declare the 201 foot long Roe River northeast of Great Falls the world's shortest river. Guinness editors agreed, and the Roe displaced Lincoln City's D River in the 1988 edition of the record book. But Lincoln City was not about to be sold short.

Well, that's just what students in Great Falls intend to do, and they'll look no farther than the Roe. Nardinger said the Roe could claim a length of only 30 feet because it has two forks, and the students submitted the longer of the two for consideration of the record.

Thanks to the meddling of a group of sharp eyed Montana fifth graders, Oregon's D River has lost its 30 year title as the world's shortest river, but not without a fight from miffed local officials. Editors of the Guinness Book of World Records agreed to give the title to the Roe River in Great Falls, Mont., after students there spent the past school year researching the river, which flows through a state park. The students concluded the Roe is 201 feet, far shorter than the 440 foot D River near Lincoln City, and submitted their evidence to the Guinness editors.

This evaluation was in broad agreement with the conclusion reached earlier by the bank's consulting engineers, RENDEL PALMER &amp; TRITTON together with Dutch consultants NEDECO and BANGLADESH CONSULTANTS.

Hundreds of people turned out to labor with shovels and bare hands for their moment of fame as builders of the world's longest sand sculpture. After crews worked much of the day under a hot June sun, a surveying company certified Friday that the sand castle measured 15,063 feet, giving the crew a good shot at getting into the next Guinness Book of World Records. The centerpiece of the project, a 15 foot high castle with the logos of corporate sponsors, had been built earlier in the week by two leading sand sculptors, Todd Vander Pluym and Mark Altamar.

An estimated 15 million Hindus holy men from their Himalayan cave homes, naked recluses from forest dens and ordinary pilgrims from across India began immersing themselves at the confluence of two sacred rivers today. Today's bathing is the high point of the seven week Kumbh Mela festival, which according to the Guinness Book of World Records is the largest religious gathering on Earth. The ceremonial bathing began at 4 a.m. with the blowing of conch shells and the chanting of hymns by the faithful, who believe a dip in the rivers on this astrologically auspicious day will free them from the cycle of reincarnation and allow them to achieve salavation.

A giant, 18 foot long alligator is living in Lake Okeechobee, boaters and fishermen claim, but a state wildlife expert says he doubts it. It looks monstrous, bigger than our boat, and we have a 19 footer, Rebecca Dunn, who has been fishing on the lake with her fishing guide husband since 1966, said recently. We see it all the time, said Mrs. Dunn, who said she believes the alligator is a female.

Still, it wasn't until just three years ago that tourists outnumbered scientists visiting the area. </P> <P> I flew to the nearest city Cuiaba in late June during the dry season, when wildlife in the Pantanal can best be seen. With a bottle of local rum, three cameras and a guide, Luiz Roberto, who could identify what seemed like a million animals, I set out for a weeklong adventure into the New World's largest breeding grounds.

Forming the world's longest conga line with almost 120,000 dancers was no problem Sunday for members of the crowd that filled the streets of Little Havana for the Calle Ocho festival. It's very easy: Just face toward downtown, grab the shoulders of the person in front of you and dance, Juan Carlos Sanchez, organizer of the event. Anna Nicholas, a representative of the Guinness Book of World Records, confirmed a record had been set at 119,986 dancers, shattering the old mark of a 10,442 person chain formed last August in Canada.

Every carving and artifact in the area is likely to be laid on the ground before thatch huts, all for sale at prices a fraction of those outside the country.

The huge pressure vessel from the world's first dismantled commercial nuclear reactor is awaiting better weather to begin its 8,100 mile journey through the Panama Canal to Washington state for burial. The 1,000 ton vessel and neutron shield tank from Shippingport, the nation's first commercial nuclear plant, were packed in concrete and lifted onto the 200 foot seagoing barge Paul Bunyan in the Ohio River last week. The 60 day journey to the U.S. Energy Department dump at Hanford, Wash., will begin in several weeks when officials can count on better weather along its route down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and through the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific Ocean, department spokesman Tom Bauman said Wednesday.

Oil rigs disguised as dinosaurs and four giant red lobsters were the winning entries in a national design contest to decorate a rundown gasoline station built in the mid 1950s. The jury initially dismissed the lobster motif as too whimsical, but we kept coming back to it, over and over, said former Mayor Pamela Plumb, one of the judges. It would become the Eiffel Tower of Portland, an instant landmark and potential meeting place, she said.

Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who fell from grace because of drug abuse at the Olympics, is listed the world's fastest man with his 100 meter run of his time of 9.83 seconds at the World Championships in Rome on Aug. 30, 1987. World records at the Sept. 17 Oct. 2 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, came too late to be included, and will go into the 1990 edition subject to them not being beaten, said Guinness Book of Records' sports compiler Stewart Newport. However, he said, Johnson's world record breaking 100 meter win in Seoul will be reduced to a footnote that reads: Ben Johnson ran 100 meters in 9.79 seconds at Seoul, South Korea, on Sept. 24, 1988, but was subsequently disqualified on a positive drugs test for steroids.

Population density in Bangladesh is 2,000 per sqaure mile, the world's highest after Hong Kong and Singapore. While Hong Kong and Singapore are little more than city states, however, Bangladesh is an agricultural nation of about 55,000 square miles, roughly the size of Wisconsin. Seventy five percent of its people work in agriculture, working the rice paddies and jute fields inundated by the floods.

From the first dry hole to Big Bertha, the world's most productive drill bit, the records, trivia and history that give the oil bidness its unique, colorful character have been chronicled by an industry trade journal. Drilling Magazine, updating a list it first ran five years ago, is giving its 20,000 readers primarily well site operators some targets to shoot for and records to brag about. It's sort of the oil industry's Guinness Book, says Editor Mike Killalea, who compiled the facts appearing in the current issue of the bi monthly magazine.

From the Jamuna bridge to automatic spindles in the textiles factories and tilling machines on the farms, the country needs capital to help promote economic growth. Without faster growth, it cannot hope to meet the needs of its swelling population. The government and development organisations monitoring Bangladesh, led by the World Bank, regard the lack of investment as the country's most important economic failing.
