But Patten said that since he didn't come to Australia seeking Keating's support, he was not disappointed he did not receive it and was delighted with what he described as an extremely satisfactory meeting. Talks lasting 75 minutes at the prime minister's official residence in Sydney ranged over bilateral trade links, regional issues such as the Asia Pacific Economic Co operation (APEC) group and Hong Kong's future after the British colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.

But Patten said that since he didn't come to Australia seeking Keating's support, he was not disappointed he did not receive it and was delighted with what he described as an extremely satisfactory meeting.

The excuse for the trip was the opening of the Friendship Bridge over the Mekong River on the border of Thailand and Laos. The real purpose, however, was to further strengthen Australia's relations with two of the most important nations in the region.

That, undoubtedly, has a calming effect on Australia's relations with its more volatile ASEAN neighbours. With its well developed defence forces (including significant naval forces) and its borders with Cambodia and Laos, Thailand is also an important player in the development of Cambodia and Indo China. Vietnam's importance is more strategic than economic.

Vietnam's importance is more strategic than economic. Indeed, for all the country's recent growth and long term potential, it will be a small, poor economy for many years to come.

Vietnam's importance is more strategic than economic. Indeed, for all the country's recent growth and long term potential, it will be a small, poor economy for many years to come. Strategically, however, it is of enormous potential importance in the region, mainly because of its large and well educated population and its border with China.

The Chinese are paranoid about Vietnam, which is why they spent a fortune to support the Khmer Rouge on Vietnam's south western flank.

The central objective of Western policy towards Vietnam must be the country's successful economic and political integration into the international community. Vietnam needs massive infusions of capital and technology to rebuild and expand its basic infrastructure (which is insufficient for even its current needs), to develop its rich natural resources and to create employment in labour intensive manufacturing.

As aid projects, Mr Keating's proposed high profile projects including a $100 million bridge over the Mekong River and the preservation of Hanoi's historic architecture sound as questionable as the Hawke Government's Friendship Bridge that Mr. Keating went to Asia to open.

However, Mr Keating obviously expects the political and economic benefits to Australia of the projects (in terms of goodwill and access of Australian companies to the increasingly competitive Vietnamese market) will make up for any shortfall in their economic or social value to the Vietnamese people.

Mr Keating was the sixth leader and the 14th senior politician to visit Vietnam in a month. For that reason, the importance to the Vietnamese of Mr. Keating's visit and offer of aid should not be overestimated. Nevertheless, they undoubtedly represent a significant, positive step in the development of Australian Vietnamese relations.
