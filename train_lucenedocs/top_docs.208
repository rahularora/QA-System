In Indiana, where time zones can divide a town, many people keep two reckonings of the hour to cope with living in a time warp. Hoosiers say the state's three time zones wreak havoc on business and family life. At no time does the entire state follow the same clock, creating timekeeping headaches from urban centers to country hamlets.

Hoosiers say the state's three time zones wreak havoc on business and family life. At no time does the entire state follow the same clock, creating timekeeping headaches from urban centers to country hamlets. People live in one zone and work in another, children cross time lines to and from school, prime time programming for televison is complicated and meetings can be disrupted by delays, latecomers and no shows.

Saturday's strike in Srinagar was to protest the Sopore deaths, Kaiser Mirza, a local journalist, quoted shopkeepers as saying. The curfew relaxation began at 5 a.m. and ended at 5 p.m. Mirza said most shops did not open in the morning when curfew was lifted, and a few shops that did open soon put down their shutters when owners learned of the strike call. It was not immediately clear if the shops were closed fearing attacks by the militants or to sympathize with the separatist cause.

BFN [Text] New Delhi, May 22 (AFP) India is ready to talk to Moslem militants to end the four year old separatist campaign in Kashmir, but Pakistan cannot be included in the negotiations, a federal minister said here on Sunday [23 May]. Internal Security Minister Rajesh Pilot told the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency that New Delhi had an open mind on holding talks with anybody if it helps to bring back normalcy in Kashmir. But Pilot rejected suggestions from a top Kashmiri militant leader, Yasin Malik, that New Delhi should start an unconditional dialogue with Kashmiris and Pakistan if it wanted peace in the northern state.
