The goal of opening up the system of walls and hedges mentioned in the article is but one of several proposed by our office in 1986 that are based in part on research previously performed by William H. Whyte and the Project for Public Spaces. These include: increased visibility into the park, increased circulation within the park, enhancement of the formal French landscape design, increased public seating and increased security.

<P> A landscape architect has been hired by disgruntled merchants to remove the grass in Horton Plaza Park and replace it with flowers and shrubs to discourage loitering by drug dealers and panhandlers. </P> <P> But before work can begin, the plans must be approved by the City Council, said Ed Foster, a member of the Horton Plaza Park committee. </P> <P> The grass will be taken out and replaced with seasonal flowers, with hedges around the perimeter, Foster said.

One of the areas that has been the subject of much restoration work and expenditure has been the park's mall, which stretches from 66th Street to 72nd Street on the east side of the park. An area just to the east of this mall is known as the Concert Grounds and here stands the remarkably handsome and appropriate Naumburg Band shell a gift to the City of New York in 1921 from a music enthusiast, Elkan Naumburg. The limestone band shell resembles a giant ruined portion of a Roman building and its great coffered half domed ceiling, while looking marvellous also projects the sound of an orchestra or band perfectly.

The Queen's Stand at Epsom Racecourse by Richard Horden Associates; the new car park in Chichester by Birds Portchmouth and Russum; and Winchester City offices designed by the Hampshire County Architects department.
FT934-5675
The remaining three schemes on the shortlist represent three very different types of building. The Queen's Stand at Epsom Racecourse by Richard Horden Associates; the new car park in Chichester by Birds Portchmouth and Russum; and Winchester City offices designed by the Hampshire County Architects department. Epsom clearly needed an elegant new stand that could comfortably house the crowds on Derby day as well as provide a centre for functions and entertainments throughout the year.

The choice of Richard Horden and Associates as architects was a brave one. The practice is known for its structural and engineering expertise and its experimental approach to building technology. The client, United Racecourses, has, by choosing a radical approach that is both refined and practical, acquired a new stand that is the acme of contemporary design.

One of the more bizarre garden stories since Eden has been unfolding for four years now, in the private paper and crayon fantasies of artist Jennifer Bartlett. And if she and the Battery Park City Authority have their way, her horticulturally inept plan will soon go public as a real garden artwork in the downtown complex. South Gardens, as the Bartlett scheme is called, will occupy the last 3.5 acres of open space at the southwest tip of Manhattan.

<P> San Diego has a tradition of borrowing architecture, regardless of how well it fits this region. Pirated home designs have been especially popular, such as the 19th Century salt boxes and Victorians lifted from the eastern United States. </P> <P> Downtown, where there hadn't been new homes for decades before '80s, developers and architects have built apartment buildings and single room occupancy hotels that address the street on a pedestrian scale with interesting architecture.

Just compare a '70s SGPA project like the wood shingled Pacific Plaza on Garnet Avenue in Pacific Beach with such '80s stucco cousins as The Promenade on Mission Boulevard in Pacific Beach or North County Plaza near Highway 78 in Carlsbad. </P> <P> Architects at SGPA, seeing the wood shingle style as a bygone sign of the '70s, have taken to calling such designs woodsy goodsy. But there's no denying a certain warmth and charm often lacking in the larger all stucco projects of today.

But perhaps the most innovative aspect of the city approved plan is its flexibility. While it limits development for the entire project and sets public space requirements, the plan allows the developers to concentrate public space in five locations instead of apportioning it on a lot by lot basis. We broke the site up into small parcels so it won't seem like a project, Mr. Cooper says.

This book was full of utopian ideas about town planning based upon Howard's own version of what he called, 'Common sense socialism'.

The Canadians hired Sir Roy Strong, former director of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, to be their open space adviser.

It was Inigo Jones who was asked by King James I of England and VI of Scotland to offer an account of the origins, meaning and purpose of Stonehenge. His thoughts and researches were not published until 1655, and when they were they were curiously inaccurate and speculative. Jones thought that the group of megalithic stones was a Roman temple in the Tuscan Order, open to the heavens, and dedicated to Coelus, or Uranus, the oldest god in the classical pantheon.

The college of the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. John the Evangelist and the Glorious Virgin St. Radegund is better known as Jesus College, Cambridge. When the college was founded in 1496 by John Alcock, Bishop of Ely, he took over the convent buildings, including the priory church which was begun in 1150. Jesus College is fortunate in having a site that is extremely spacious the five courts are surrounded by generous gardens and playing fields.

In 1950 the Ordnance Survey published a map of monastic Britain which gave the names and locations of the 900 monasteries and nunneries of the pre Reformation country. It is hard for us to imagine the holocaust of destruction that followed King Henry VIII's suppression of the monasteries and today it is difficult to conceive of a Britain that in some ways must have been like Tibet a land full of monks and nuns, even in its remotest corners. It was, I think, Sacheverell Sitwell who said that the great monastic ruins of England were the equivalent of Cambodia's Angkor Wat or Egypt's Abu Simbel.

After 30 years of committees, proposals and no small amount of bickering, a downtown center opens this week giving Seattle a combination town square, office tower, shopping arcade, bus station and monorail terminal. That's a minor miracle, says Stephen Koehler, president of Koehler McFayden &amp; Co. of Seattle, one of the project's co developers. There's so many people and so many ideas of what was going to go into the small space called Westlake, that it's really impossible to make all the people happy about this.

Sir, Let me clarify some of the issues raised in 'New York's oasis of the park' (July 13), an account of New York City Parks &amp; Recreation's proposed removal of the Naumburg Bandshell from Central Park. When Central Park was built, Frederick Law Olmsted included an octagonal cast iron bandstand designed by Jacob Wrey Mould on a grassy area to the west of the mall. This bandstand remained until 1923 when it was demolished owing to its dilapidated condition, and replaced by the current bandshell on the east side of the mall.

By contrast, the pocket decks, patios and outdoor public dining areas visible around the edges of L'Auberge Del Mar make it immediately inviting.
