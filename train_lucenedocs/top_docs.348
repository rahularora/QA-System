The Great Pyramid of Cheops, the most famous of ancient Egypt's royal tombs, was declared safe for tourists and reopened Saturday for the first time in nine months. A Dutch woman and an American student were the first of the scores of tourists who waited under the hot Egyptian sun to tour the pyramid. Since August, workers had been sealing cracks, reinforcing limestone slabs for safety and clearing vermin from the inside of the magnificent structure, which now boasts television monitors.

Last spring archaeologists clearing another part of the cemetery found the well preserved, gypsum masked head of a female mummy from about the same period, her faint smile reminiscent of the Mona Lisa's. Giza Plateau has two great cemeteries: the Eastern, between the Great Pyramid and the Sphinx, and the Western, wedged between the pyramids of Cheops and Chephren.

Specialists investigating why the Sphinx is crumbling say the culprit is sewage from a tacky tourist village and a hotel favored by the rich and famous. Cries of alarm were raised in early February, after a chunk of limestone fell from the 4,500 year old statue's right shoulder. Suddenly, salt oozing through the limestone statue and previously ignored cracks in its pharaoh's face and lion's body were seen as evidence the monument was near collapse.

Before the recent study, Hawass said, it was assumed the statue was deteriorating due to changes in the underground water table, caused by the Aswan High Dam's regulation of the Nile River's flow.

NAZLETT EL SAMMAN, Egypt (AP) Sewer workers have discovered remains of a temple that Pharaoh Cheops built for his funeral 4,600 years ago, and Egyptologists are hoping it will tell them more about the mysterious pharaoh of the Great Pyramid. The discovery this month of Cheop's Valley Temple confirms theories about the layout of Giza Plateau for the 70 year period in which the pharaoh, his son and grandson built their three pyramids and monuments nearby. Nazlett el Samman lies at the foot of the plateau, facing the Sphinx, and sewage from the village often is mentioned as a cause of the Sphinx's dangerous deterioration.

Pyramid, a PBS special on Monday night, is about some world famous monuments dedicated to the notion that you CAN take it with you. Based on David Macaulay's 1975 book, Pyramid combines location shots of some of Egypt's greatest wonders with an animated cartoon story weaving historical gossip about royal family intrigues and speculation on how the tombs were built, some of them more than 4,000 years ago. The show clearly explains the details of construction, although plot twists in the animation, a kind of docudrama historical cartoon strip, tend to get a little too convoluted.

Chunks of stone that fell from the 4,500 year old Sphinx have been returned to their place, and the statue will undergo emergency restoration at five other weak points, an official said Wednesday. Besides weathering the ravages of desert sands and winds over the centuries that caused the pieces to fall from the right shoulder of the half man, half lion, the statue also has been victim of a bad restoration project, which had further worsened its condition, said Zahi Hawass, director general of the Pyramids area. The Sphinx is like a suffering old man who needs an operation, Hawass said of the world reknowned statue, which lies near the three famed Giza pyramids on Cairo's western outskirts.

Two small pyramids built for the wives of Pharoah Pepi I were discovered under mounds of sand by French scientists who say the find could shed light on a dynasty that ruled Egypt more than 2,000 years before Jesus was born. The discovery was announced Friday by members of the French Archaeological Mission at Sakkara and scientists from Electricite de France, the state owned utility which conducted a high tech exploration at the site about 20 miles south of Cairo. The Sakkara site contains the step pyramid built by King Zoser, said to be the first stone structure in history, and other pyramids.

One pyramid is in ruins, but the second could contain subterranean funeral chambers decorated with hieroglyphics, said Jacques Montlucon, who led the utility's team. In the 19th century, the 50 acre Sakkara site served as a quarry from which stone was taken for building in Cairo.

Tourists can still see the subtle smile but little else of the Sphinx, the half man, half beast crouched in the desert sands guarding the pyramids. The smile projects above protective scaffolding being erected to envelop the chest of the ailing 4,600 year old statue as Egyptian authorities try yet another remedy for the ills afflicting one of the world's best known monuments. The effort has surrounded the stoic stone statue with turbaned workers prying rocks from his massive paws, sticking sensors into his backside or hammering on the wooden chest girdle.

They put her in a coma, stopped her heart, chilled her by 40 degrees and drained her body of blood. St. Lawrence was back at work 10 weeks after what she calls a cotton pickin' miracle, a sort of suspended animation that lets surgeons cure hard to reach, high risk aneurysms that once were considered inoperable.

Working from a plywood shack and tents perched on the flank of Augustine Volcano, researchers are setting up a high tech system to measure the volcano's shudders to within an inch. When they're done, scientists using briefcase sized laser instruments could detect less than that, but it's a matter of whether you believe it, says Gene Iwatsubo of the U.S. Geological Survey, one of the researchers trying to puzzle out how the volcano works and whether its eruptions can be predicted. The thrust of the research is to try to find precursors, signs of eruption, says Juergen Kienle, a University of Alaska geophysics professor.

Information that may enable scientists to predict eruptions accurately at Augustine may be of great value to other parts of the world where millions of people live in the shadows of volcanoes or on them.

The Great Pyramid of Cheops, pocked by thousands of years of vandalism and stone robbing, is finally getting a facelift. The effort to clean rubbish from between the massive limestone blocks and to tighten loose rocks marks the first restoration work ever attempted on the outside of the sole survivor of the ancient world's Seven Wonders. This is not just cosmetic work, said Zahi Hawass, Egyptian Antiquities Organization director general for the pyramids area.

Workmen cleaning a heavily traveled tourist area of a fabled temple stumbled across an ancient hoard of statues of pharaohs and gods, a discovery that researchers called a potential gold mine of historical data. Officials said five statutes so far have been dug up inside the famous Luxor Temple in Luxor, a Nile River city about 450 miles south of Cairo. There are other statues still buried, and only small parts of them are showing, Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization.

He and his principal financial partner, international businessman John Tigrett Sr., expect to spend some $80 million developing the pyramid park project. The pyramid began with plans four years ago to provide a new basketball arena for Memphis State University. The idea grew of building a pyramid shaped arena to play on Memphis' link to its namesake, the ancient capital of Egypt which stood beside the Nile.

After years of bitter debate, President Francois Mitterrand on Wednesday reopened the Louvre as a gleaming, high tech museum capped by a controversial glass pyramid at the main entrance to the medieval palace. Visitors poured in for their first look at the six year, $850 million overhaul designed by American architect I.M. Pei and still in progress.

Sayed Tawfik, Egypt's chief archaeologist and chairman of antiquities, has died of a heart attack at age 54, friends and newspapers reported Friday. Tawfik, a former dean of archaeology and professor of Egyptology at Cairo University, was the author of a half dozen books on Egyptian antiquities. As chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, he was in charge of all restoration and conservation work on Egypt's vast legacy of pyramids, tombs, temples and other relics threatened by time, pollution and the demands of an exploding population.
