A senior official of the Bahamas is angered by a State Department charge that systemic corruption in his government is undermining a combined campaign against illicit drug trafficking there. Paul L. Adderley, attorney general of the Bahamas, also disputed recent testimony of an admitted marijuana smuggler that he paid Prime Minister Lynden Pindling millions of dollars to protect operations in the Caribbean country. What offends us the most is the judgment that if it were not for corruption and indifference in this country, the Bahamas would not and could not be used as a transit route for the smuggling of Colombia cocaine and marijuana to South Florida, Adderley told a Senate hearing Monday.

If the corruption and indifference that is perceived were to magically disappear, the rate of smuggling might not diminish at all simply because I regret to say the United States has not put the personnel, equipment and operating funds into doing what needs to be done in the Bahamas, he said.

The Bahamian government has its own ideas about the property of Carlos Lehder Rivas, whose conviction on U.S. cocaine smuggling charges led to a jury ruling that the Colombian should forfeit his Bahamas assets to the United States. The Bahamas whose leader reportedly is a potential target of the Lehder trial prosecutor plans to move to confiscate Lehder's property itself, according to a statement released Friday by the Bahamas Information Service. The Bahamas has laws that allow it to confiscate the land of those convicted of drug trafficking outside the Bahamas and it will use these provisions to confiscate Lehder's Bahamian assets, the statement said.

Prosecutors at the trial of alleged drug lord Carlos Lehder Rivas produced more than 100 witnesses over 22 weeks to show that he operated a multimillion dollar smuggling business centered on the Bahamas. While the prosecution tried to draw a noose around Lehder, it also presented evidence of the key role of the Bahamas island chain, and a federal grand jury reportedly is looking into the activities of Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling. Lehder, 38, is accused of conspiring to smuggle 3.3 tons of cocaine into the United States through his private island in the Bahamas, Norman's Cay, from 1978 to 1980.

Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN [Text] Nassau, Bahamas, Jan 23, CANA Bahamas has recorded a definite decline in trafficking of illegal drugs through a new anti drug effort between the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos Islands and the United States, says Public Safety and Transport Minister Arlington Butler. Operation Bahamas Turks and Caicos Islands (OPBAT), a cooperative effort involving the three territories, was started in April 1992 to stamp out the drug trade. And already, 18 months later, Butler says cocaine trafficking through the islands has dropped.

The public safety minister added that the 1993 total for cocaine seizure, though not yet official, was expected to be just about 700 kilos. This is an 86 per cent decline from the 4.85 metric tons seized in 1992 and it is the lowest annual seizure total since late 1970, he said.

The minister explained that another first for the Bahamas in 1993, was that there was not a single interception of cocaine at an airstrip in the Bahamas. The fact that only two airdrops were intercepted in Bahamian territorial waters compared to six in international waters show great respect for the OPBAT and an obvious decline in the traffic.

The race will be the fiercest political battle he and his Progressive Liberal Party, or PLP, have faced since 1967, when he helped expose a crooked white minority government and launched the movement that won independence from Britain and made him a national hero.

Advocating increased economic opportunities in the Bahamas for black people, who make up 85 per cent of the population, Sir Lynden has always argued that he was seeking economic justice for all Bahamians. However, his administration had been accused of being corrupt. In 1983, there were allegations in the US that senior officials of the Bahamian government, including Sir Lynden, were involved in drug smuggling.

First, the shaky status of federal drug indictments in Miami and Tampa against Panama Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has raised doubts about whether the United States would want to indict a foreign head of state. The Reagan administration reportedly has offered to drop the indictments in a deal in which Noriega would step down from power. I find very little incentive indicting foreign potentates if the State Department can negotiate them right out from under my feet, said U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, who has indicated he'll quit if the indictment against Noriega is dropped.

Drug traffickers have all but taken over the Bahamian island of South Bimini, chasing off U.S. patrol boats with gunfire and intimidating the Bahamian military, say Customs Service reports and law enforcement officials. A Bahamian police lieutenant on the island even removed a suspected drug smuggler from a U.S. boat and freed him, says a U.S. Customs Service report obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press. Customs Service spokesman Michael Sheehan and Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Jeff Karonis refused to give details of the case, saying the matter is being handled by the U.S. Embassy in Nassau, the Bahamas.

Lehder was extradited to the United States last year following a firefight and his arrest by the Colombian army at a Medellin mansion.

The result: Almost all the big banks have routinely failed to meet reserve requirements, and credit dried up because the central bank forced the banks to build up liquidity. Businesses fear the credit shutdown could lead to a real estate disaster, as dozens of half built shopping malls and hotels won't be completed without more financing. Economists predict gross national product, which grew at an average 7% for the past several years, may decline 3% or worse.

A State Department official testified Tuesday in the cocaine trial of Carlos Lehder Rivas that he tried to alert the Bahamas' prime minister to illegal activity in the islands, but was only asked the identity of his sources. Andrew F. Antippas, former deputy director the U.S. mission in Nassau, said he was removed from his post in 1983 after investigating complaints about the Bahamian island of Norman's Cay.

He railed against the U.S. Colombian extradition treaty, since voided by that nation's supreme court, calling it an example of U.S. imperialism.

DEA agents say Lehder was active in the drug related violence that swept Colombia, working with guerrilla forces to arrange the assassination of government officials who opposed the drug trade. Lehder's operation began to unravel when Bahamian forces and the DEA began to focus on Norman's Cay, with the help of marijuana smuggler Ed Ward, who had joined forces with Lehder in 1978 after meeting him on the island.

Carlos Lehder Rivas, reputedly a leader of a violent Colombian drug cartel responsible for most of the cocaine imported to this country, was convicted Thursday of smuggling more than three tons of cocaine into the United States. The verdict capped a seven month trial on a federal indictment charging him with taking over the island of Norman's Cay in the Bahamas to smuggle cocaine into Florida and Georgia from 1978 to 1980. This is truly a major victory in the war on drugs, said U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, the lead prosecutor.

The drug indictment of a top Haitian military officer has spotlighted that nation's emergence as a way station for cocaine traffickers seeking safer routes and reinforces charges that corrupt officials aid smugglers. Col. Jean Claude Paul, along with his brother and ex wife, were charged in a federal indictment unsealed Thursday with using a landing strip on the colonel's farm to fly a 100 kilogram, or 220 pound, cocaine shipment to the Bahamas for delivery to Miami. Haitian President Leslie Manigat has turned Paul's case over to his country's military courts for investigation.

Federal indictments alleging a Cuban role in cocaine shipments from Colombia marked the third time in recent months that the Caribbean island nation has been linked to the narcotics network. The two indictments unsealed Friday charged 17 people with smuggling cocaine into Florida through a Cuban military base, and a federal drug official said the operation apparently had official cooperation. Nine defendants had been arrested by Friday night, said Jack Hook, a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman.

The Senate on Wednesday supported President Bush's certification of the government of the Bahamas as fully cooperative in the war on drugs, rejecting an effort to overrule his action. Senators voted 57 to 40 to defeat a resolution offered by Sen. John Kerry, D Mass., to brand the Bahamas as uncooperative in important areas, a move that would have subjected it to the loss of 50 percent of U.S. aid. During debate, Kerry said the Bahamian government has been uncooperative in many areas including effective prosecution of arrested drug traffickers while providing only superficial and self serving cooperation with U.S. law enforcement agencies.

Bahamanian Prime Minister Lynden Pindling, at odds with NBC over allegations about drug smuggling, has canceled a Wednesday appearance on the network's Today show to discuss the libel lawsuit he dropped. Pindling on Friday accused the network of violating an agreement by announcing earlier in the day that he had dropped his lawsuit, filed in Toronto in 1984, against NBC and correspondent Brian Ross. The $4 million lawsuit, which also named as defendants 16 Canadian cable and communications companies, stemmed from NBC Nightly News broadcasts in 1983 and 1984 about a cocaine cartel NBC said was operating in the Bahamas.

The defense attorney for Carlos Lehder Rivas charged Wednesday that prosecutors used bought witnesses who were promised reduced sentences or other favors for testifying against the reputed Colombian drug lord. In closing arguments at Lehder's cocaine smuggling trial, defense attorney Edward R. Shohat said the chief prosecution witness got the break of a lifetime for his testimony against Lehder. By agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors, convicted smuggler Ed Ward was able to reduce a possible 215 year sentence and $5.9 million fine to less than six years in prison, Shohat said.

A federal judge today refused to permit testimony about Nazi memorabilia reportedly seen in the home of Carlos Lehder Rivas, who is on trial for cocaine smuggling. U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton ruled that it was inadmissable and prejudicial for Gorman Bannister, a protected federal witness, to mention seeing a gold swastika and statue of Adolf Hitler in Lehder's home in Medellin, Colombia.
