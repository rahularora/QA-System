Comcast is stirring up support among local politicians, and got a boost from the chairman of the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, Edward Markey, who put out a news release urging the 76ers to reconsider the deal. PRISM and the 76ers, who haven't yet closed the deal, declined to comment. We aren't going to debate our business in the newspapers, says Donald Heller, vice president and general manager of PRISM.

The stereorangefinder and the tracking device are interfaced, the latter sending signals to a light source for the road. In the stereorangefinder a right prism with mirror faces is placed symmetrically between two terminal reflectors of incident light. This prism combines the light coming from both reflectors into a single beam and sends that beam through an intensity regulator into an objective followed successively by a focus magnifier and a beam splitter.

Two hoods, one around each reflector, prevent entry of sunlight or the headlight beam of a train into the system. The spectral sensitivity band of the system is 0.45 0.90 m, which covers both visible and near infrared light so that the system can respond to semaphore lights of all three colors: green (0.51 0.55 m) yellow (0.57 0.59 m) red (0.62 0.78 m) semaphore lights.

Prism Leisure Corporation, the music and computer games group traded on the USM, returned record profits of Pounds 975,000 pre tax for the 52 weeks ended March 29. The 28 per cent improvement over the previous year's Pounds 761,000 was achieved on the back of an 8 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 13.5m. Earnings rose by 5p to 16.8p and an increased final dividend of 3.95p makes a 5.45p (4.95p) total.

Confederation Life, Canada's fourth biggest life company, has passed on the management of its derivatives portfolio to Sumitomo Bank Capital Markets. Many companies have become increasingly nervous about using derivatives, following losses in recent months by Metallgesellschaft, Procter &amp; Gamble, and others. While it is highly unusual for a company to farm out all its derivatives management to an outside specialist, the growing need for sophisticated operational controls and computer systems when using derivatives has made it increasingly difficult for companies to manage risk effectively in house.

The Air Force has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on gold plated chandeliers, golf course projects and other luxuries to boost morale, internal Pentagon documents show. Back in 1985, the Air Force decided to refurbish its officers' club at the Mildenhall base in Britain at a cost of $75,000. The service's champagne taste, however, hardly matched the appropriated amount.

In the documents, Air Force management at the base in England argued that the chandeliers couldn't be standard issue. Low quality chandeliers could not act as the main architectural highlight of a room as the existing chandeliers do.

The crystal used would not have the capability to break apart the available light in a room into its primary colors (prism effect), the Air Force said. In response, the auditors said spending an additional $15,900 in appropriated funds to purchase chandeliers that have the correct prism effect' is not appropriate.

I find it appalling that the weaknesses in the management and oversight of Morale, Welfare and Recreation operations have been repeatedly documented by Defense Department auditors, whistleblowers and Congress, that hundreds of millions of dollars are being illegally spent on parties, golf courses and officers clubs, yet internal recommendations to remedy the problems have been ignored, Boxer said in the letter.

New Process May Boost Biodegradable Plastics ANTI PLASTIC sentiments stirred by a mounting national garbage disposal crisis have companies scrambling to rush biodegradable plastics to the market. But these materials all have one problem: starch. Biodegradable products deteriorate as their molecules are eaten by microorganisms.

Biodegradable products deteriorate as their molecules are eaten by microorganisms. Plastic molecules, however, are too big for microorganisms to consume. So, the molecules are mixed with starch, which the bacteria or fungi can eat, breaking the plastic molecules down into smaller, bite sized pieces.

So, the molecules are mixed with starch, which the bacteria or fungi can eat, breaking the plastic molecules down into smaller, bite sized pieces. But starch also weakens plastic's structure and can introduce microorganisms into food packaging. Ramini Narayan, the head of organic and polymer research at Purdue University, has overcome these difficulties with a process that has attracted the interest of such big plastics makers as Dow Chemical Co. and Mobil Corp. To prevent microorganisms from devouring the plastic as it sits on a grocery shelf, Mr. Narayan uses cellulose acetate, a natural plastic derived from wood pulp, instead of starch.

These two annotated block diagrams are used in a detailed discussion of instrument structure and functioning. The comparison of the experimental and theoretical performance of the two types of systems revealed that in the OEP 1 its energy potential is not fully realized due to the great diameter of the entrance pupil of the optical unit and the lesser D T[.sub]equiv noise[/] level.

The angular resolution of the OEP 1 could be increased by increasing its focal length, but that would considerably increase its size and weight. The OEP 2 can ensure greater linear scanning fields than the OEP 1, which makes it possible to use photodetectors with a greater number of sensing elements.

Looking at Russia today can be done through three possible prisms. Through one, we would see economic and political improvement, albeit springing from and to an extent dragging with it considerable chaos. Through another, we would see a further and perhaps even more damaging confrontation between political powers and or economic collapse albeit not leading back to a reassertion of a communist regime.

For the medium term, at least, this trend is likely to continue. But the shape of the labour force is changing in a way which puts a premium on training. At the time of the last census in 1987, when the population of the county was about 400,000, the number of jobs in the county was nearly 130,000, roughly 10,000 more than in 1980.

This term reflects the SPM and GVD compression effects. In a CPM laser, two nonlinear optical processes can produce SPM and also lead to chirping.

In a CPM laser, two nonlinear optical processes can produce SPM and also lead to chirping. One is a negative chirp caused by a reflectance change from a slow absorption saturation effect and the other is a positive chirp caused by the fast Kerr effect of the solvent in the absorber. Under normal conditions, the chirps generated by these two processes cancel each other because of opposite signs.

At the same time, a larger positive SPM broadens the frequency spectrum of the pulse to lift the restriction imposed by the gain bandwidth.

It is easier to obtain a shorter pulse by way of negative GVD compression. At the same time, a larger positive SPM broadens the frequency spectrum of the pulse to lift the restriction imposed by the gain bandwidth. On the basis of this unique property of the CPM laser, we made some improvements in areas such as resonant cavity design, dye concentration and pumping condition that result in a larger frequency bandwidth and a larger positive SPM.

On the basis of this unique property of the CPM laser, we made some improvements in areas such as resonant cavity design, dye concentration and pumping condition that result in a larger frequency bandwidth and a larger positive SPM.

Thus, a suitable negative GVD compensation can be introduced by tuning the prism GVD compensator to obtain a narrow fs pulse. It is estimated that with a large positive chirp and an ideal GVD compensation, it is possible to compress a pulse from its normal width of 30 40 fs by a half.

Thus, a suitable negative GVD compensation can be introduced by tuning the prism GVD compensator to obtain a narrow fs pulse. It is estimated that with a large positive chirp and an ideal GVD compensation, it is possible to compress a pulse from its normal width of 30 40 fs by a half. The CPM dye laser is a system comprised of six mirrors and four prisms.

The CPM dye laser is a system comprised of six mirrors and four prisms. Compared to a classic CPM system, its unique feature is the use of an anti symmetric folded cavity as a sub cavity for its gain medium and absorber. This design not only provides better aberration compensation but also permits near normal incidence and reflection at all mirror surfaces, i.e., a quasi linear cavity.
