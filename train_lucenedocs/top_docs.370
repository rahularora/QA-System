Physicians need to act more aggressively on the initial complaints of women especially younger women who find lumps in their breasts, a study of breast cancer malpractice claims and lawsuits indicates. The study by the Physician Insurers Association of America found that in 69 percent of cases where claims were paid because breast cancer diagnosis was delayed, the patient had discovered the lump. The physician needs to be impressed by such findings and order follow up studies, said the report.

A gene found to be defective in a rare eye cancer has been linked to breast cancer and a common form of lung cancer, researchers say. The gene was the first of a new group of anti cancer genes that normally protect against cancer but allow cancer to appear when defective, said Ray White of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Similar anti cancer genes now have also been linked to colon cancer, another common and lethal form of cancer.

Striking regional variations are revealed by the first atlas of cancer incidence in England and Wales, published yesterday, Clive Cookson writes. The atlas, commissioned by the Cancer Research Campaign, shows that lung cancer, the most common form of the disease in men, is much more prevalent in the north than in the south. The reverse is true for breast cancer, the most common cancer in women.

However, far more study will be necessary before researchers know for sure whether this approach will cure cancer. The findings were presented Tuesday by Dr. Oliver W. Press of the University of Washington to the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Moreover, the blood test may make preventive exams much more common because it is more acceptable to many patients than rectal exams. Some researchers urge that the blood test be used for early detection of prostate cancer, much as mammograms are used to screen for breast cancer in women. It's a valuable new tool for diagnosing prostate cancer, an area where we're not doing very well, says William J.

Smoking among American men has been dropping since the early 1950s, but federal researchers say women kept taking up the habit into the next decade and are now paying the price with higher rates of lung cancer. Unless women start quitting in significant numbers, the public health problem is going to get more significant no question about it, said Dr. Edward J.

The Atlanta based Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that lung cancer deaths increased 15 percent in the United States between 1979 and 1986, to a rate of about 50 deaths per 100,000 people.

The number of older women getting mammograms increased noticeably after Nancy Reagan's breast cancer diagnosis, researchers said Thursday. A survey taken in 33 states by the Centers for Disease Control found that 38 percent of women age 50 and up questioned in November and December 1987 said they had received a screening mammogram for breast cancer within the previous year. That was up nearly half again from the 26 percent the survey found in the first two months of that year.

Nancy Reagan's triumph over breast cancer and a publicity campaign about the disease may have sent thousands of women to their doctors for potentially life saving mammograms, federal health officials reported. A survey of health behavior in 33 states by the Centers for Disease Control found that 38 percent of women age 50 and older questioned in November and December 1987 said they had received a mammogram for breast cancer within a year. Those findings, shortly after the then first lady's October diagnosis, marked an increase of nearly 50 percent over the 26 percent the survey found in the first two months of that year.

A genetic abnormality that appears to play a role in many common cancers has been solidly linked to lung cancer, raising hopes of improved diagnosis and treatment, scientists say. Researchers examining lung cancer tumors discovered a series of abnormalities in the so called p53 anti cancer gene, according to a report Tuesday by Dr. John Minna of the National Cancer Institute Navy Medical Oncology Branch in Bethesda, Md. Defects in the gene also have been linked to colon cancer, to an uncommon bone cancer called osteogenic sarcoma and to chronic myelogenous leukemia, Minna said.

One thing you could do would be to take people's tumors, see how many (genetic) lesions they have, and determine how virulent they are, Minna said Tuesday in a telephone interview from Toronto, where he presented his findings at the Bristol Myers Cancer Research Symposium. Vogelstein has found that the more genetic abnormalities a colon cancer tumor has, the more virulent it is, Minna said.

British scientists have developed an experimental vaccine for bowel cancer, the second most common cause of cancer deaths in industrialised countries. It is being tested first as a potential treatment for patients with advanced cancer but could be used eventually as a preventive vaccine for people known to be genetically at risk from colo rectal (bowel) cancer. The Cancer Research Campaign, which funded the vaccine's development at Nottingham University, said yesterday: 'The first clinical trials indicate impressive results in patients.

Researchers studying the gene that causes retinoblastoma, a rare childhood eye tumor, discovered a surprising link between the gene and small cell lung cancer, a malignancy that afflicts smokers. The study suggests that the eye cancer oncogene plays a role in the genesis of the adult malignancy that affects about 25,000 to 30,000 people a year, one fourth of all lung cancer cases. Moreover, some scientists speculate that the link to the gene may supply a potential reason why some smokers get the cancer and some do not.

Dr. Minna, a co author of the paper, said the work contributes to the two hit theory of lung cancer.

An abnormal gene found in some families can lead to a high susceptibility to breast cancer, according to a study published today. The finding is a major step that puts researchers closer to understanding the inherited tendency to develop malignancies, says study in the journal Science. The inherited genetic mutation was discovered by studying the genes in a small group of families that experience in generation after generation of an exceptionally high rate of six types of cancer, including breast cancer.

The researchers estimated that of the 176,000 women who develop breast cancer each year, between 7% and 14% may be carrying the A T gene. The new finding is likely to heighten the debate over whether women younger than 50 years of age should undergo periodic mammographic examinations that involve exposing the breast to weak or soft X rays. Since breast cancer is less common among younger women, various medical groups have argued heatedly whether the mammography uncovers enough curable breast cancers to outweigh the possibility that the X rays might induce some new breast cancers.

Researchers at the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute will conduct a five year study of the rate at which some people who receive transplanted organs develop cancer. In the process, the $5 million study funded by the National Cancer Institute may provide clues to the relationship between cancer and viruses and the way in which the body combats those diseases, one official said Tuesday. It has broad implications for better understanding of mechanisms that lead to the development of cancer, said Dr. Theresa Whiteside, director of the institute's immunologic monitoring and diagnostic laboratory and a professor of pathology at the University of Pittsburgh.

Medical scientists are starting to uncover a handful of genes which, if damaged, unleash the chaotic growth of cells that characterizes cancer. Scientists say the discovery of these genes in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops. An emerging understanding of the genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention.

Skolnick said the study also suggests that the inherited risk for breast cancer, thought previously to be a factor primarily in families in which cases develop in young women of childbearing age and in women who develop cancer in both breasts, may also be a factor in families where the cancer develops only in older women. Our study shows that there is a significant genetic component for unilateral (single breast) post menopausal breast cancer as well, he said. For this reason, Skolnick said the inherited risk of breast cancer may be more common than previously believed.

Until now, there was scant evidence about exactly what causes the gene to go awry, although scientists have speculated that environmental agents, such as sunlight or radiation, are the trigger. There is little doubt that skin cancer involves exposure to the sun, but we didn't know exactly what happens, said David Leffell, chief of dermatologic surgery at the Yale medical school. Now we do.

Thus, researchers are considering the possibility that tamoxifen could be used for hormone replacement therapy much as estrogen therapy is now used in post menopausal women. The new evidence on tamoxifen's effects on cholesterol, for example, lends support to a suggested large scale trial in healthy older women to see if the drug can reduce the incidence of breast cancer, heart disease and bone fractures due to osteoporosis, the weakening of the bones commonly seen in women after menopause, the Wisconsin researchers stated in the report in the Dec. 1 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine. The researchers, headed by Richard R. Love of the university's Clinical Cancer Center, said they had done periodic blood tests on 64 women who were taking tamoxifen in an experiment to see if the drug would reduce the recurrence of breast cancers.

Federal health officials said Thursday that hospitalization rates have fallen in the 1980s for four major types of cancer, even though the number of people suffering from the diseases has not fallen in all cases. The national Centers for Disease Control reported that hospitalization rates for breast cancer, lung cancer, colon and rectal cancer, and cervical cancer all have declined during the decade. The rates are calculated by looking at records of hospital discharges.

Researchers report in a study published today that a gene previously linked to breast cancer also can also be found in ovarian tumors. The study, published today in the journal Science, suggests that testing for the presence of the gene may provide a way of tailoring cancer treatment to the precise needs of a patient. In a cooperative study by seven laboratories, researchers found that a specific cancer related gene, called the HER 2@neu oncogene, was present in tumors of both the breasts and the ovaries.

By shrinking tumors with medicine before surgery, doctors may be able to eliminate most mastectomies as the standard treatment for breast cancer, a leading cancer researcher said Monday. Dr. Gianni Bonadonna of the National Cancer Institute of Italy said his study showed that the new approach could eliminate the need for mastectomies in 87 percent of women who otherwise would have had this mutilating surgery. In recent years, doctors have slowly switched to removing just the lump, not the whole breast, when the tumor is small.

However, this conservative surgery is not usually considered possible when tumors are large. The latest strategy involves shrinking big tumors first with chemotherapy so they are small enough to be taken out with a breast saving operation called a lumpectomy, which generally leaves about three quarters of the breast intact.

For women who have used the pill for 10 years or more, the study found, the risk of breast cancer was four times greater. The issue is of particular concern because oral contraceptives are the most popular form of birth control in the United States, and breast cancer is the second most common fatal cancer in women.

BFN <F P=106> [By Susie Weldon] </F> [Text] Viral hepatitis infections surged in 1992, with more than twice as many cases recorded as in the previous year, according to statistics just released by the Department of Health. More people were also diagnosed as having sexually transmitted diseases, died of lung cancer and heart disease, or were admitted to hospital because of injury or poisoning. The department's annual report for 1992 93 shows that 4,357 hepatitis cases were reported in 1992 compared with 1,801 in 1991.

A woman who undergoes an X ray breast examination every year during her 40s would cut her risk of dying of breast cancer by 26%. But urging annual mammography for all women between ages 40 and 50 years would boost the nation's medical bill by more than $400 million for the year 2000 while saving 373 women from dying of breast cancer that year. So concluded an unusual cost benefit analysis of X ray mammography by researchers from Duke University and the American Medical Association, published this week in the association's journal.

Her chances of dying of a breast cancer that develops during this time is 82 out of 10,000. However, these odds are reduced to 60 out of 10,000 if she undergoes annual mammography during her 40s, a 26% reduction in the risk of dying of a breast cancer that develops before age 50. The estimates take into account that there's a 1 in 25,000 chance that the annual X rays, themselves, will cause a breast cancer.

BFN <F P=106> [Article by Susie Weldon] </F> [Text] Viral hepatitis infections surged in 1992, with more than twice as many cases recorded as in the previous year, according to statistics just released by the Department of Health. More people were also diagnosed as having sexually transmitted diseases, died of lung cancer and heart disease, or were admitted to hospital because of injury or poisoning. The department's annual report for 1992 93 shows that 4,357 hepatitis cases were reported in 1992 compared with 1,801 in 1991.

Genetic tests on women with breast cancer could determine the risk of recurrence for some patients, improving the chance of treating women generally thought to be safe, a researcher said Friday. Cancer specialists also report that the use of lumpectomy and radiation therapy appear to be promising alternatives to breast removal for a common form of early breast cancer. The scientists' findings are being presented this week at the American College of Radiology's 24th annual National Conference on Breast Cancer.

Studies of nearly 29,000 breast cancer patients leave no doubt that drug and hormone therapies improve chances of surviving the disease, the second leading cancer killer of American women, researchers say. Analysis of 61 studies showed that a synthetic hormone called tamoxifen improves the survival of breast cancer victims over age 50, while chemotherapy helps younger women. During the first five years after treatment, tamoxifen reduced the odds of death among older women by about one fifth, the analysis revealed, while a combination of chemotherapy drugs reduced the odds by about one quarter for younger victims.

Now physicians will have the actual numbers in hand, said another co author, Dr. William Wood of Massachusetts General Hospital.

A panel of experts says removing a cancerous tumor in the early stages of breast cancer gives as good a survival chance to women as more radical surgery in which the entire breast is removed. Mastectomies, in which the entire breast is removed, and lumpectomies, in which only the tumor is removed, both give excellent results for Stage I and Stage II breast cancer, the panel said. The committee of 15 experts was assembled by the National Institutes of Health to consider research on the survival of women with early stages of breast cancer and to develop a consensus on what therapy should be used to treat the disease.

The potential for using this gene in early detection of the cancer is very exciting to us, said Bert Vogelstein, the molecular biologist whose laboratory made the discovery. Colon cancer can be very lethal, but it only is dangerous when it's allowed to advance to the point that it spreads to other tissue. Caught early the disease is completely treatable.

A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago, researchers reported. The asbestos fiber, crocidolite, is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs, with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later, researchers said. Lorillard Inc., the unit of New York based Loews Corp. that makes Kent cigarettes, stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956.

Because there can be a delay of several decades between starting to smoke and the onset of disease, the big rise in lung cancer did not begin until the 1940s among men and the 1970s among women (see chart). The male lung cancer rate is falling in countries such as the US and UK where large numbers of men gave up smoking in the 1960s and 1970s, but it is rising throughout the developing world. Female lung cancer rates are increasing everywhere.

Preliminary studies in mice suggest that an air pollutant may hasten the spread of cancer within the body, a researcher said Tuesday. Mice with cancer that breathed air containing nitrogen dioxide, which is found in smog, showed higher numbers of cancer cell colonies in their lungs than mice than breathed purified air, said Arnis Richters. It is very difficult to say at this point, what does it mean for human populations, said Richters, an associate professor of pathology at the University of Southern California School of Medicine in Los Angeles.

But the treatment, which typically costs $100,000 or more, is risky. About 9% of patients with various stages of breast cancer have died from complications after the therapy, according to Dr. Antman.

Prostate cancer, another kind of carcinoma, is the most common malignant tumour in men worldwide. The cause of this slow growing tumour is unknown, although there appears to be a hormonal relationship. It appears to be on the increase even in areas where it was previously uncommon, such as east and southeast Asia.

Prostate cancer is frequent in North America and Europe. Incidence and mortality increase in Chinese and Japanese after migrating to the US. Prostate cancer is rare before the age of 50 but then its occurence grows steeply with age until about 80 when it begins to fall again except in Norwegian, French and Japanese populations.

Incidence and mortality increase in Chinese and Japanese after migrating to the US. Prostate cancer is rare before the age of 50 but then its occurence grows steeply with age until about 80 when it begins to fall again except in Norwegian, French and Japanese populations. When it comes to screening, a combination of Digital Rectal Exam and a relatively inexpensive blood test is probably the best balance between cost, benefit and efficacy.
