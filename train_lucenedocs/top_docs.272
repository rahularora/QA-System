The head of a government probe on the deaths of 104 aborigines in police custody has resigned, and indigenous activists today called the decision a devastating blow to the inquiry. Prime Minister Bob Hawke said James Muirhead, federal court judge since 1977, resigned late Thursday to become administrator of the Northern Territory. Aboriginal groups called the decision a blow to their cause and expressed concern that the inquiry, set up in 1987 to investigate 44 aboriginal deaths in police custody since 1980, could be downgraded.

The government Tuesday broadened a probe into the deaths of aborigines in police custody to discover why proportionately more of the native people than other Australians end up in jail. The Royal Commission of Inquiry said it was concerned by government statistics that show aborigines, about 1 percent of the 16 million population, are six times more likely to go to jail than white Australians. While investigation of aboriginal deaths in custody is important, so too is learning the lessons of the past and acting to prevent further deaths, said Elliott Johnston, who is heading the inquiry.

To stem a rash of aborigine deaths in police custody, a government report today urged that drunkenness be abolished as an offense and racist police officers be replaced by aboriginal recruits. The preliminary report calls for widespread changes in Australia's legal, police, prison and medical systems to tackle the problem and warns that a failure to institute such changes would damage Australia's reputation abroad. It was issued by James Muirhead, a lawyer who Prime Minister Bob Hawke appointed last year as head of a royal commission formed to investigate the deaths of 44 aborigines in police custody since 1980.

AUSTRALIAN aborigines yesterday threatened an avalanche of land claims, after a High Court judgment had recognised the existence of land titles pre dating European settlement in 1788. The High Court ruled that the Miriam people of the Murray Islands, part of the Torres Strait islands group off the north coast of mainland Australia, had retained ownership of their land under common law. The court restricted its judgment to the Murrays, and ruled that the concept of 'native title' could exist only where such rights had not been extinguished by the government.

However, aboriginal leaders said the judgment challenged the legal status of the Australian government, which relies for its legitimacy on the claim that the country was terra nullius when annexed by Britain. This signifies that the land was effectively unoccupied, or occupied by people who lacked a system of land tenure which would have inhibited annexation and settlement.

Families of four aborigines who died in police custody today denounced a government report on the deaths that criticized police but stopped short of recommending criminal charges. The report, issued Thursday, found no evidence of foul play in the four deaths but said they probably could have been avoided. Judge James Muirhead was ordered by the government of Prime Minister Bob Hawke in 1987 to investigate 44 aboriginal deaths nationwide since 1980.

THE AUSTRALIAN federal government has moved to dampen a heated national debate over native land claims, granting some rights to aborigines over mining leases but overriding claims to residential and pastoral land, reports Reuter from Canberra. Special minister of state Mr Frank Walker, leading negotiations on the issue, said the cabinet decision should allay aborigines' concerns over mining on native lands. 'The government has decided that we will give aboriginal people the same rights as everyone else in the community, a right to negotiate and then if that doesn't work a tribunal who'll arbitrate,' Mr Walker said in a radio interview.

AUSTRALIA'S federal government, under pressure from miners and state governments, yesterday gave its support to a Queensland aluminium and bauxite project that promises 2,000 jobs but is under threat from an aboriginal land claim. Mr Michael Lavarch, the attorney general, said legislation protecting Comalco's Weipa project, the first working mine to be hit by a native title claim, may be introduced in September. 'The mining leases which Comalco hold will be validated,' he said in a radio interview.

The ruling was the last straw for many people in the mining industry, which was already concerned about the federal government's decision to block a gold project at Coronation Hill because of Aboriginal religious objections.

As Australia begins its bicentennial year amid protests by some of its Aborigine population, one proposal that has cropped up has been for a treaty or compact between the government and its Aboriginal citizens that would recognize the Aborigines' prior ownership of the land. Such a treaty, however, is inherently divisive and undoubtedly would create more problems than it would solve. In particular, it would perpetuate differences and increase resentment at a time when we should be seeking to weld a strong nation out of Australia's many ethnic and cultural components.

Efforts to increase significantly the money available to a federally constituted Aboriginal land fund were defeated yesterday in the Senate, the Australian parliament's upper house. The fund is designed to acquire land on behalf of the vast majority of Aborigines who will see no practical benefit from the country's Native Title legislation, which was passed with much difficulty last year. The Native Title act was the first piece of legislation to acknowledge that Australia was inhabited before European settlement.

An Australian aborigine at the center of a manhunt that sparked a public uproar was arrested with a hostage on the Queensland Gold Coast after a 10 day sweep across three states, police said Thursday. John Porter, captured late Wednesday, was the key suspect in the shooting and wounding of two Sydney policemen during an attempted car theft on April 24. One of the policemen allegedly shot by Porter, 26 year old Alan McQueen, died Friday morning despite emergency surgery in which doctors removed a lung, a kidney and most of his liver.

THE Australian government yesterday announced plans to spend ADollars 150m (Pounds 66m) over five years to try to improve living conditions for the country's Aboriginal minority, and combat discrimination by white Australians. The spending forms the first government response to the report of a Royal Commission into the deaths of 99 Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in police custody. The Commission found that the prisoners, most of whom committed suicide, were victims of 'entrenched and institutionalised racism and discrimination'.

AUSTRALIA, one of the strongest supporters of sanctions against apartheid in South Africa, is embroiled in a debate over the extent of institutionalised racism against its Aboriginal minority, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. Race relations have rarely been smooth since the first white settlers arrived in Sydney 204 years ago. But two incidents in recent weeks suggest that official prejudice against blacks remains widespread.

Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN [Text] Sydney, Dec 11 (AFP) Britain has closed the door on a controversial part of its relationship with Australia by agreeing to pay a 45 million dollar [Australian dollars] (30 million U.S.) settlement over sites it once used for nuclear tests, Aboriginal Affairs Minister Robert Tickner said Saturday. The ex gratia payment ends a long running dispute over the clean up of British test sites at Maralinga, Monte Bello Islands and Emu Field in the southern Australian outback. Australia has long argued that it was Britain's responsibility to clean up the nuclear contamination which it claims still affects the lives of local Aborigines.

Indeed, earlier this month, Prime Minister Hawke appeared to prepare the industry for a decision against mining by stressing that Coronation Hill shouldn't be regarded as a litmus test.

Outside advisers to the Jawoyn say that all the pressure of justifying their ties to Sickness Country which forced them to reveal certain secrets of their ceremonies and other taboos to strangers helped confuse the old men and led to conflicting stories.

THE GOVERNMENT of Australia yesterday moved to protect MIM Group's ADollars 300m (USDollars 210m) lead and zinc mine in the Northern Territory from possible Aboriginal land claims. The move came amid fears in Australia of an avalanche of land claims after a high court decision recognising the existence of land titles before the Europeans came in 1788. The Northern Territory government has filed a bill to override native titles that might be presented against MIM's titles covering its leases for the McArthur River project.

Archaeologists on Friday reported finding a huge Stone Age factory in the Outback where aborigines crafted stone blades and cutting tools for barter some 2,000 years ago. Scattered among weathered stone outcrops were hundreds of thousands of remains of stone tools and implements that point to a sophisticated aboriginal enterprise long before Europeans set foot on the continent. The site at Tiboobura, 530 miles northwest of Sydney, is so large that archaeologists believe its output may have formed the basis for a local export industry.

The first claim from the Wiradjuri people over land in New South Wales passed the anthropological test yesterday. Today debate over the degree to which the act impinges on state rights is expected to dominate a meeting in Hobart, Tasmania, between the prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, and Australia's state premiers. The law stems from a 1992 High Court ruling that said, for the first time, native title rights could exist in Australia if the indigenous inhabitants had maintained a 'close and continuing' association with a piece of land.

The law stems from a 1992 High Court ruling that said, for the first time, native title rights could exist in Australia if the indigenous inhabitants had maintained a 'close and continuing' association with a piece of land. With that single ruling, the doctrine of terra nullius the notion that Australia was unoccupied prior to European settlement was overturned.

MR Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, yesterday delivered a blow to the nation's farmers when he hinted that proposed native land rights legislation would allow claims against land held under pastoral leases. The government had previously indicated that only mining leases would fail to extinguish native title, which, in turn, could 'co exist' with the mining lease and revive once the latter expired. During parliamentary question time yesterday, Mr Keating said he expected only about 11 pastoral leases issued between the implementation of the 1975 Racial Discrimination Act and 1993 to be affected by the government's legislation.

Aboriginal groups, by contrast, argued that pastoral leases should be among the leases which did not extinguish native title rights.

Aboriginal groups, by contrast, argued that pastoral leases should be among the leases which did not extinguish native title rights. Mr Keating said yesterday the legislation would allow states to validate all pastoral leases without the lessees having to disprove the existence of residual native title.

Mr Keating said yesterday the legislation would allow states to validate all pastoral leases without the lessees having to disprove the existence of residual native title. Holders of pastoral leases on land covered by native title would have primacy, with no question of co ownership. 'The only question then at issue is whether in validating these leases, we should go so far as to extinguish native title completely and forever, or whether we should leave the relationship between lease rights and native title to the common law,' he said.

The Australian Senate, the federal parliament's upper house, yesterday referred the government's contentious Aboriginal land fund legislation to a select committee for further examination. The move came despite warnings from Senator Gareth Evans, the government's Senate leader, that this could trigger a 'double dissolution', that is, a dissolution of both houses, necessitating fresh elections. The legislation proposes to establish a ADollars 1.4bn (Pounds 680m) land fund by 2004, through a series of government payments over the next 10 years.

Political disorders, ethnic tensions, poverty and international disputes are churning up the South Seas in an arc curving sharply northward from New Zealand and back down to Australia. Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji, Tahiti, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Western Samoa, even New Zealand and Australia themselves, have had a taste of trouble in the past year. Most recently it was rioting in Vanuatu over land claims, and in the French territory of New Caledonia 19 native Kanaks were killed in a shootout with French troops in ethnic and political disorders.

Since then, the Soviet Union has sought fishing agreements with Papua New Guinea and impoverished Kiribati, creating concern in Australia as well as Washington about Soviet inroads in the region. More recently, the Soviet Union has approached Australia for fishing access to Australian ports for refueling purposes and to Australian airports for fishing crews in transit.

Aboriginal elders today invoked tribal laws to protect a crocodile that killed a member of their tribe, telling police to stop hunting the reptile because it is sacred. Police reported that aboriginal clans were holding a tribal meeting to decide what to do after a 25 year old aborigine of the Gumatj tribe in the Northern Territory was found bitten in half at a pond. The victim was not identified but was believed to have been snatched while camping alone 10 miles from the mouth of the Cato River.
