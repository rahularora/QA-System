But early ranchers wasted no time in finding practical uses for them: the prickly pear cactus was commonly used to fence in animals (or to keep trespassers out); some types are edible, and in times of desperation, a cactus can even be a source of water. </P> <P> As Southern California faces yet another water crisis, gardeners looking for ways to conserve water may not have to look any further than their own back yards. Cacti and succulents can add symmetry, texture and color to a landscape and all the while conserve water during the dry summer months because of their ability to store water.

The investigation was characterized as the largest federal case ever undertaken involving a protected plant. Fish and Wildlife agents, alerted to the cactus theft problem by Arizona officials several years ago, set up a phony business in suburban Scottsdale in 1986 and began posing as cactus dealers. We saw what we felt was a very flourishing business when we first started, said Richard Marks, the Fish and Wildlife Service agent who headed the investigation.

NOW THAT virtually all the geraniums we use for planting outdoors in summer are grown from seed, it is easy to forget that there is a different and very important though much smaller trade in geraniums grown in the traditional way, from cuttings. This is carried out by nurseries, a few of which, such as The Vernon Geranium Nursery, Cuddington Way, Cheam, Surrey; Fibrex Nurseries, Honeybourne Road, Pebworth, Stratford on Avon, and Thorp's Nurseries, 257 Finchampstead Road, Wokingham, Berkshire, grow hundreds of varieties. I have just received the 1992 Vernon catalogue, which is exceptionally well illustrated and it made me think about the varied types of geranium that are available in this way.

V.E., Sunnyvale; A The tipoff to the problems you are experiencing in growing lavender is in the watering schedule and the amounts of water applied to your plants. One of the reasons we don't recommend planting of drought resistant materials during a drought is that it takes frequent, regular watering of your new plants the first year, or one growing season and one winter. This gives the plant an opportunity to get established and send roots down deeply into the native soil.

Still, there are plenty of locations where you can see wildflowers, especially in moist coastal areas and at some Southland botanic gardens, where patches of wildflowers are seeded and irrigated.

Hundreds of the world's endangered plants, from tiny Indonesian orchids to the giant saguaro cactus of Arizona, have found a home in a cluster of government run greenhouses where they are nursed back from the brink of extinction. We keep the Noah's Ark of the plant world, said Rob Pennington, superintendent of collections at the U.S. Botanic Garden's 20 acre Poplar Point Nursery in southeast Washington. Among the 25,000 plants that flourish in the nursery's two dozen greenhouses on the Anacostia River banks are about 3,000 rare and exotic specimens seized by customs officials at U.S. ports of entry.

Texas farmers burned the thorns off cactus to provide emergency cattle feed in a drought called the worst in a half century, while growers in the Midwest bemoaned Thursday's scattered showers as little more than tantalizing. It's going to help a few farmers, but for most farmers it's too little too late, said Dan Bowman, a meteorologist for WeatherData in Wichita, after some Kansas communities got more than 2 inches of rain and Joplin, Mo., got 1{ inches Thursday morning. Drought has plagued the nation's midsection, where it's as dry as it's been since the Dust Bowl, and the Southeast, forcing farmers to sell off cattle they can't afford to feed and to plow under shriveled crops.

A seven mile stretch of the Ohio River near Mound City, Ill., remained closed to all traffic while a dredge deepened a shallow channel. Dozens of towboats and barges were stranded.

IF YOU dug up dahlia tubers last autumn and stored them for the winter in a dry, frost proof place you should be thinking now about starting them into growth again.

This is not ideal because it is such a big change of environment and there are hungry slugs and snails waiting to eat the dahlia shoots. However, as a rule a good sprinkling of slug pellets in each planting hole and also on the surface when planting is completed will look after these enemies, and a covering of at least two inches of mixed soil and either peat or compost will give adequate protection from the short duration frosts that are all we are likely to get now.

This is where the dirty hands business comes in. The roots are generally in a solid ball and you will have to work your fingers through the rootball to loosen and remove the planting medium. The roots feel like thick strands of day old spaghetti, and when you are done, there should be no old planting medium left on the roots.
