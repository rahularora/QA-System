Most of the talk was about the women because a couple of them did their world record busting at the Phillips 66 National Swimming Championships on the campus of Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), which natives of the Hoosier metropolis shorten to Ooey Pooey. The meet doubled as the Olympic Trials, with the top two finishers in each event qualifying. Last Sunday, the event's first day, Jenny Thompson, 19, a blue eyed blonde from Stanford U. via Dover, N.H., churned the 100 meter freestyle in the unprecedented :54.48.
