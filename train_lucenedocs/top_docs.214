The question had never crossed my mind before it was announced that the soccer World Cup would be played on American soil. As soon as I heard the news I was ecstatic, but confused. How could soccer's most prestigious tournament be played where football, baseball and basketball reigned supreme; where soccer had not even been televised on the four major networks; and where anyone who wants to watch a soccer game either has to listen to a commentary on a cable station probably in a different language or go and watch a college match, at times possibly the most embarrassing athletic vision the US has to offer?

My feeling is that it was the suburbs and the immigrant communities around the country that helped create the impression of some interest in soccer.

An Oslo University medical student says he's determined that soccer players who use their heads to strike at balls are risking brain damage. Thirty percent of retired Norwegian soccer players were found to have signs of minor brain damage from heading balls, according to the survey medical student Alf Thorvald Tysvaer conducted for his doctoral thesis. Tysvaer said in an interview with the news agency NPK that 3 percent of the active Norwegian soccer players he studied also showed symptoms of brain damage.

Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO <F P=106> [Article by Atsunobu Takeshita] </F> [Text] The stable existence of N60 was confirmed jointly by the National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research (NIMCR), Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, and Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Nissan Motor). Increasingly promising lately is the potential for N60, the molecule consisting of 60 nitrogen atoms bonded in a soccer ball shape, to be used as rocket fuel capable of generating the world's highest thrust. Supercomputer simulation confirmed the existence of N60 as the nitrogen version of the newly emerging promising material, C60, made of 60 carbon atoms.

NIMCR's Chief Researcher Takehiro Matsunaga, who proposed the N60 concept, says this: When I saw the crystalline structure of C60, I immediately sensed that the world's most powerful explosive could be made if the same structure could be applied to nitrogen atoms.

NIMCR and Nissan Motor are jointly developing the next generation rocket fuel. The joint team has been in search of a compound capable of generating a sufficiently powerful thrust to propel heavy rockets faster and farther. Although nitrogen exists as a stable gas, its compounds can become powerful explosives.

The joint team has been in search of a compound capable of generating a sufficiently powerful thrust to propel heavy rockets faster and farther. Although nitrogen exists as a stable gas, its compounds can become powerful explosives. TNT, today's most widely used explosive, is also a nitrogen containing compound.
 FBIS3-21226 
Although nitrogen exists as a stable gas, its compounds can become powerful explosives. TNT, today's most widely used explosive, is also a nitrogen containing compound. Compared with oxygen and hydrogen, the atomic bonding force in nitrogen is greater, and therefore, when the bond is destroyed, larger energy is released.

TNT, today's most widely used explosive, is also a nitrogen containing compound. Compared with oxygen and hydrogen, the atomic bonding force in nitrogen is greater, and therefore, when the bond is destroyed, larger energy is released. In other words, if a compound can be synthesized from nitrogen atoms only, the compound can be a powerful explosive.

From that standpoint, the crystalline structure of the soccer ball like C60 was the ideal shape for explosive researchers.

The technology makes use of the heat that is released when oxygen and hydrogen react. Specific impulse, an index of a rocket's efficiency, for H2 is approximately 445 seconds. By computation, the group obtained a specific impulse of approximately 550 seconds, approximately 20 percent better than the above value, for the predicted N60, despite the common knowledge that it is almost impossible to improve specific impulse by even one second with today's fuel technology.

Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO [Text] The National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials, STA, has succeeded in synthesizing diamond from fullerene crystals (C[.sup]60[/], soccer ball shaped carbon molecules) by using shock compression. The synthetic diamonds obtained by using fullerene crystals as a starting material are ultrafine particles about 10 nm in diameter. The yield is about 50% of the starting material at about 20 GPa and when the pressure is increased to 50 GPa, the yield reaches almost 90%.

Initially, magnetic fields in the brain and heart will be measured with a system that has 64 channels using SQUID and 16 channels using high temperature superconduction; the interrelationship of this with data from imaging diagnostic and other equipment will be studied; and the goal will be to complete a 200 channel biological magnetic field measurement imaging system. The Superconducting Sensor Research Institute will begin experimental measurement of magnetic fields in the brain and heart from FY94.

A man who slipped and fractured his kneecap at a Rod Stewart concert has sued the Cajundome, Stewart and his promoters, claiming it was a disabling, permanent injury. Charles K. Falterman, 27, filed the lawsuit Tuesday, saying he was injured April 22 when Stewart began kicking soccer balls into the audience and the crowd reacted almost as an uncontrollable herd of animals. Falterman said he was near the stage at the time and one soccer ball came near him.

University of Mississippi officials say a trust fund for paralyzed Ole Miss football player Roy Lee Chucky Mullins has reached more than $697,000. School officials attribute the most recent contributions to a plea broadcast during the nationally televised Liberty Bowl game Dec. 28 when the Rebels defeated Air Force. More than $12,000 was received by mail on Jan. 3, the first day the university's Office of Development was open after the game.

Ambassador Everett E. Briggs. Quayle had a good reason for remembering the occasion despite a day filled with plane, helicopter and motorcade trips across two countries and a myriad of meetings that focused on the region. Because it also happens to be my mother's birthday, Quayle said.

Quayle had a good reason for remembering the occasion despite a day filled with plane, helicopter and motorcade trips across two countries and a myriad of meetings that focused on the region. Because it also happens to be my mother's birthday, Quayle said. He said he cabled birthday greetings to Washington for the president.

Because it also happens to be my mother's birthday, Quayle said. He said he cabled birthday greetings to Washington for the president. But his 67 year old mother, Corinne, had to wait for her son's birthday wish.

He said he cabled birthday greetings to Washington for the president. But his 67 year old mother, Corinne, had to wait for her son's birthday wish. The vice president said he had tried to reach her but didn't know where she was.

Quayle's family was also on his mind Monday as his motorcade sped through Guatemala City. The vice president called the motorcade to a halt in front of a small, open air store and went on a short shopping spree as a crowd of onlookers gathered. The saleswoman showed him T shirts and a peasant skirt, but Quayle had his eye on the store's assortment of soccer balls.

Quayle's visit to the U.S. military training installation at Soto Cano Air Force Base caused considerable interest among the service members who are restricted to the base for their training. Quayle reviewed the troops, dressed in camouflage fatigues, then headed to the rustic wooden mess hall for a cafeteria lunch of beef, potatoes and salad. Quayle had 20 men sitting on either side of him.
