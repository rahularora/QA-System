Treasures even greater than those in King Tut's tomb may still be lying under the desert sands of Egypt. When I'm asked if there's another Tut's tomb out there, I always answer at least one, maybe more, said Zahi Hawass, director of the Giza pyramids area outside Cairo and the huge ancient cemetery of Sakkara, 11 miles to the south. My guess is we've found no more than 30 percent of what's buried.

An ancient mummy of an aristocratic young woman, her Mona Lisa smile frozen in a plaster death mask, has been unearthed in a shallow pit at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Cheops. She's really lovely, said Aly Hassan, director of pharaonic monuments for the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. Hassan dated the mummy as 4,400 years old, one of the earliest ever found in Egypt.

The falling of a piece of rock from the crumbling body of the Sphinx has caused an avalanche of debate over the future of the 4,600 year old monument and Egypt's other ancient treasures. The principal casualty of the uproar has been Ahmed Kadry, formerly chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. Kadry lost his job after accusing his boss, Culture Minister Farouk Hosni, of staging the falling rock incident to reflect badly on Kadry's stewardship of the Sphinx and the other relics of Egypt's rich past.

NAZLETT EL SAMMAN, Egypt (AP) Sewer workers have discovered remains of a temple that Pharaoh Cheops built for his funeral 4,600 years ago, and Egyptologists are hoping it will tell them more about the mysterious pharaoh of the Great Pyramid. The discovery this month of Cheop's Valley Temple confirms theories about the layout of Giza Plateau for the 70 year period in which the pharaoh, his son and grandson built their three pyramids and monuments nearby. Nazlett el Samman lies at the foot of the plateau, facing the Sphinx, and sewage from the village often is mentioned as a cause of the Sphinx's dangerous deterioration.

Experts investigating why the Sphinx is crumbling say the culprit is sewage from a tacky tourist village and a hotel favored by the rich and famous. Cries of alarm were raised in early February after a chunk of limestone fell from the 4,500 year old statue's right shoulder. Suddenly, salt oozing through the limestone statue and previously ignored cracks in its pharaoh's face and lion's body were seen as evidence the monument was near collapse.

Workmen cleaning a heavily traveled tourist area of a fabled temple stumbled across an ancient hoard of statues of pharaohs and gods, a discovery that researchers called a potential gold mine of historical data. Officials said five statutes so far have been dug up inside the famous Luxor Temple in Luxor, a Nile River city about 450 miles south of Cairo. There are other statues still buried, and only small parts of them are showing, Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization.

Besides weathering the ravages of desert sands and winds over the centuries that caused the pieces to fall from the right shoulder of the half man, half lion, the statue also has been victim of a bad restoration project, which had further worsened its condition, said Zahi Hawass, director general of the Pyramids area.

Pyramid, a PBS special on Monday night, is about some world famous monuments dedicated to the notion that you CAN take it with you. Based on David Macaulay's 1975 book, Pyramid combines location shots of some of Egypt's greatest wonders with an animated cartoon story weaving historical gossip about royal family intrigues and speculation on how the tombs were built, some of them more than 4,000 years ago. The show clearly explains the details of construction, although plot twists in the animation, a kind of docudrama historical cartoon strip, tend to get a little too convoluted.

One of the reasons we have such a rich legacy of artifacts and information, much of it about everyday life, is that much of it was entombed for use in the next world, said Macaulay, who has published 14 other books, including his latest, The Way Things Work. The show includes a visit to a museum with an exhibit of a replica taken from a pyramid of an Egyptian cattle dealer.

Since the 1960s, the pyramid domed sands of Abusir have yielded several major finds to Czech archaeologists: the oldest papyri found in Egypt, the oldest hall with standing columns and several spectacular statues dating from the fifth dynasty, more than 4,000 years ago. Once considered a stepchild of its famous neighbor, the Giza Plateau, Abusir became one of Egypt's most exciting archaeological sites. Because of his important titles Egypt's chief physician and overseer of the royal navy and Greek mercenaries Udjahorresnet would have been a man in the know when the Persian invasion came, Verner said.

Sayed Tawfik, Egypt's chief archaeologist and chairman of antiquities, has died of a heart attack at age 54, friends and newspapers reported Friday. Tawfik, a former dean of archaeology and professor of Egyptology at Cairo University, was the author of a half dozen books on Egyptian antiquities. As chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, he was in charge of all restoration and conservation work on Egypt's vast legacy of pyramids, tombs, temples and other relics threatened by time, pollution and the demands of an exploding population.

Tourists can still see the subtle smile but little else of the Sphinx, the half man, half beast crouched in the desert sands guarding the pyramids. The smile projects above protective scaffolding being erected to envelop the chest of the ailing 4,600 year old statue as Egyptian authorities try yet another remedy for the ills afflicting one of the world's best known monuments. The effort has surrounded the stoic stone statue with turbaned workers prying rocks from his massive paws, sticking sensors into his backside or hammering on the wooden chest girdle.

The National Geographic Society released pictures today of an Egyptian boat photographed with special equipment in a stone chamber where the royal vessel was entombed beside the Great Pyramid of Khufu 4,600 years ago. National Geographic officials said the photographs were taken with remote cameras lowered through a drill hole and that the chamber then was sealed, leaving the ancient craft undisturbed in its resting place. A similar boat was found in a chamber nearby in 1954.

Two small pyramids built for the wives of Pharoah Pepi I were discovered under mounds of sand by French scientists who say the find could shed light on a dynasty that ruled Egypt more than 2,000 years before Jesus was born. The discovery was announced Friday by members of the French Archaeological Mission at Sakkara and scientists from Electricite de France, the state owned utility which conducted a high tech exploration at the site about 20 miles south of Cairo. The Sakkara site contains the step pyramid built by King Zoser, said to be the first stone structure in history, and other pyramids.

St. Lawrence was back at work 10 weeks after what she calls a cotton pickin' miracle, a sort of suspended animation that lets surgeons cure hard to reach, high risk aneurysms that once were considered inoperable.

That's the biggest cause of death in surgery. If you could put someone in a state of suspended animation, you could operate in a totally bloodless field. In a severely cold, bloodless state, the brain can be deprived of oxygen up to 55 minutes, giving surgeons time to remove the aneurysm a bubble caused by weakness in the wall of a blood vessel and clip arteries feeding it without the danger of massive bleeding and certain death.

Working from a plywood shack and tents perched on the flank of Augustine Volcano, researchers are setting up a high tech system to measure the volcano's shudders to within an inch. When they're done, scientists using briefcase sized laser instruments could detect less than that, but it's a matter of whether you believe it, says Gene Iwatsubo of the U.S. Geological Survey, one of the researchers trying to puzzle out how the volcano works and whether its eruptions can be predicted. The thrust of the research is to try to find precursors, signs of eruption, says Juergen Kienle, a University of Alaska geophysics professor.

Tombs were used repeatedly, as late as the Christian era when Pharaonic designs sometimes were plastered over and crosses painted on. </P> <P> LeBlanc said the first burials were princes and princesses of ancient Egypt's 18th Dynasty, a 243 year renaissance when, after a period of decline, Pharaohs and their kin once again lived and died like kings.

Nature lovers defending the country's largest colony of rare egrets persuaded officials to halt an assault on nesting trees to keep bird droppings from coating parked cars. From the birds' point of view, the victory came in the nick of time: 11 of the huge trees had been ruined, scores of the majestic birds have died and hundreds of others fled to safer environs. For more than a century, thousands of egrets have made their homes in 99 tall eucalyptuses beside Cairo Zoo and along Sharia Giza, or Giza Street, a main boulevard in this Cairo suburb.

Erected with much fanfare in Central Park on Feb. 22, 1881, it was the last obelisk to leave Egypt.

The tomb, which has been closed since the early '50s, will reopen to tourists in 1991, Hosni said.

Indiana Jones and his swashbuckling treasure hunts would have been at home in Egypt in the early 1800s, when a mix of travelers and adventurers became by chance the world's first Egyptologists. The calling still retained a lot of Harrison Ford's movie character in 1922 when Howard Carter, an eccentric Briton, dug into the most famous tomb of all, the gold packed burial place of Pharaoh Tutankhamon. But as Egyptology prepares to enter the 21st century, the country that gave the science its name is asking modern lovers of its ancient past to give up the shovel and trowel.

Trippeer Jr., chairman of Union Planters National Bank, one of the facility's biggest backers.

Although repro Ramessian is nowadays rejected as kitsch, Egyptian style was once extremely influential.

Although repro Ramessian is nowadays rejected as kitsch, Egyptian style was once extremely influential. It was more exotic than Greco Roman, more accessible than Etruscan, and highly prestigious. Egyptian style was enormously versatile, associated with eternity, manliness, sexiness, exoticism, non Christian piety, and patriotism.

As an architectural style, it was also relatively simple and cheap in comparison with classicism.

As an architectural style, it was also relatively simple and cheap in comparison with classicism. So it was used extensively, for garden design, prisons, cemeteries, in bourgeois villas, Russian palaces, and the staterooms of Mediterranean cruisers.

Close by are squares where grotesque ceremonies were staged in which huge statues of Isis, the Goddess Nature, expressed jets of wine from her breasts into the cups of thirsty revolutionaries.

France even has the best claim to be called the cradle of Egyptology, born on September 27, 1822 when Champollion announced that he had discovered how to read hieroglyphics.

Because eclectic Rome was so enamoured of her Egyptian colony, it seemed quite natural that Hadrian should order the gorgeous youth to be represented as the god Osiris.
