On the one hand, since this Alice is full of episodes from those classic books, it is a bracing dip back into a sane child's discovery of the nonsensical grown up world.

There are more tigers in the world's zoos than there are in the wild 31 black footed cats; 21 sand cats; and 12 pallas cats in zoos, according to center officials. Sometimes people use the words captive' and research' as four letter words, said Lee Simmons, director of the Omaha zoo.

Alice is charmed by everything about her precocious new friend, from her exotic background to her enthusiastic disquisitions on the wonders of Mozart's Magic Flute. Then, one day, Jem disappears when the school authorities pass her over and award what should have been her scholarship to a prim, mean spirited grade grubber. A light goes out of Alice's life.

Then, a bizarre set of circumstances brings Jem back into Alice's life, and through her, an exotic, high strung Italian American man called Angeletti, who seems like Mr. Wrong, but in the curious dream logic of this boldly anti realist novel, turns out to be exactly the right person to rekindle Alice's lost capacity for joy and delight.

Invoking ghostly parallels with The Magic Flute (Angeletti as Sarastro, Jem as a benign Queen of the Night), Ms. Trapido invites us to suspend our customary suspicions of overly charismatic people and our usual disbelief in improbable happy endings.
