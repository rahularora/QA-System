Mixed in with the ads for trusses and carousel music in the 199th Old Farmer's Almanac are predictions for a cold, snowy winter and advice on helping a baby grow: Put manure in the infant's shoes. The 224 page, 199th edition hits newsstands and supermarkets this week with its traditional weather predictions, planting and tide tables, anecdotes and folklor. It claims 80 percent accuracy in its weather forecasts, but editor and part owner Judson Hale says that figure is not cast in stone.

After watching his half acre of grass wither and dry this spring, Witham Smith wrote a letter to the Old Farmer's Almanac. Smith, a regular reader of the almanac, asked whether the 196 year old publication's forecasters, having missed the Midwest's drought, could at least predict the dry spell's end. He received a pretty dry answer from Judson D. Hale Sr., editor of the almanac.

Not one to tamper lightly with tradition, the Farmers' Almanac suggests nonetheless that the date designated for Thanksgiving is a turkey.

An earlier date would rid Thanksgiving of pre Christmas overtones, allow for more favorable travel weather and line it up more closely with the harvest whose bounty it is meant to celebrate, the almanac says.

The Farmers' Almanac, renewing its crusade to revamp the nation's coinage and currency, is promoting a $1 coin to replace the dollar bill to pinch a few pennies for Uncle Sam and taxpayers. The almanac's 1990 edition, just off the presses, also calls for the elimination of the penny and 50 cent piece. The new $1 coin could be called the Columbus Dollar, honoring the explorer who discovered the New World, the publication said.

The nation's welfare system is headed for a major overhaul with the conclusion of complex negotiations on a five year plan aimed at moving welfare recipients into jobs and helping them collect more child support. The initiative agreed on Monday by Senate, House and White House negotiators had been close to death all summer as negotiators sought a balance between conservatives favoring mandatory work and liberals concerned about increasing benefits to the needy and motivating people to enter the mainstream workplace. The $3.34 billion welfare plan comes in above the Senate's own $2.8 billion measure but would cost less than half of the initial $7.1 billion plan passed by the House.

Some 4.7 million Americans will have to wait at least another year for the first raise in the $3.35 an hour minimum wage since 1981 as Senate Democrats concede a major election year legislative defeat to a Republican filibuster. Refusing to bow to GOP demands for a broad based subminimum floor under the 50 year old minimum wage, Democratic leaders on Monday gave up all hope of raising the pay base by 40 cents to $3.75 an hour in January. There is no point in our continuing to pound on their door, Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D W.Va., said on the Senate floor.

Michael Dukakis, refining his plan to break the Republican Electoral College lock, plans to curtail his efforts in several states that appear out of reach while escalating the fight for critical swing states and the major battleground of Texas, according to campaign aides. In all, the states in which Dukakis aides concede their chances of defeating Republican nominee George Bush are slim carry roughly 100 of the 538 possible Electoral College votes, with 270 needed to win the White House. One Dukakis aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the campaign would begin pulling back budget and pulling back staff and saving the resources for states that are closer to Dukakis' reach.

Parliament today named as prime minister a journalist who represented Communist authorities in 1980 81 talks with Solidarity, then defended the free trade union movement's martial law suppression. The choice of party propaganda chief Mieczyslaw Rakowski comes less than a month before planned talks between the government and Solidarity on reinstating the labor federation's legal status and reviving Poland's crippled economy. Rakowski became the country's ninth prime minister since World War II by a 338 5 vote with 35 abstentions in a nationally televised parliament vote.

Iben Browning holds dozens of patents in several specialties, but it's his earthquake projections that are stirring up notoriety he says he'd rather do without. Browning said at a conference in Missouri last year there was a high probability of an earthquake along the New Madrid Fault this Dec. 2. He was deluged by calls.

Farmers shellshocked by the 1988 drought are worrying anew whether the unusually warm winter will break, sending them the precipitation they need for next year's crops. There's a pervading omen, a feeling of ominous concern. I sense it with other farmers, I sense it with the salesmen of agricultural products, said Joe Summer, a corn and soybean farmer in McLean County in central Illinois.

Romance, clodhopper shoes for men and lullaby tapes for yuppie babies will be hot in 1989, but it will be a ho hum year for fashions and a bad year for fat kids, according to The American Forecaster 1989. Other '89 trends identified by the Forecaster: gutterless bowling alleys, fighting dogs on steroids and turkey hunting. New Age religion channeling will become passe in 1989, along with teddy bears and soft cookies, said Kim Long, author of the sixth annual 192 page Forecaster, which went on sale this week.

Young, whose findings are not binding on DEA's head, John Lawn, acknowledged that strong emotions are aroused on both sides of any discussion concerning the use of marijuana.

Weather forecasters today were offering drought stricken farmers little prospect of relief in separate outlooks for the next 30 days and three months. A new climate assessment of the ongoing drought said many areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months. The disappointing forecast came as President Reagan headed to the Midwest to inspect drought plagued farms.

The fear of a second drought looms over pockets of the still parched Corn Belt, where it's premature to predict another year of pain, but not too early to worry about whether a mild winter will bring farmers a harsh spring. Though thousands of acres of Midwest farm fields were ravaged by the drought of '88, much of the eastern Corn Belt an area east of the Mississippi River is in moderately good shape because of abundant rain last fall. We've come a long way from where we were at the end of the growing season, said Norton Strommen, chief meteorologist for the U.S. Agriculture Department.

Drought across broad patches of the nation is shriveling crops and pastures, driving up grain prices and leaving some farm workers jobless. Community water use restrictions are in place in California, the Midwest and the Southeast. It's not total destruction for all these crops yet, but another week or two of dry weather is going to put us near the point of no return, said Richard Grove, agricultural extension agent for Seneca County, Ohio.

A temporary break in the drought sparked the steepest one day plunge in soybean futures prices since 1973. Heavier than expected rains across much of the Western Farm Belt on Tuesday and yesterday, as well as forecasts for a better chance of rain for the next several days in some farm states, also deflated corn, wheat and oat futures prices for the second consecutive day. The big plunge in crop prices was primarily responsible for the third sharpest decline in the history of the Commodity Research Bureau futures price index, a closely watched inflation indicator composed of a wide range of commodities prices, including oil, metals and lumber.

In Lander, winds gusting up to 86 mph dragged a 2 year old boy down the street, said his mother, Pamela Roberts, who chased after him.

An elderly South Texas weather prognosticator assures George Bush's inaugural planners their worst nightmare a snowstorm won't come true to ruin the festivities surrounding Bush's swearing in as president on Jan. 20. This old gentleman from South Texas sent me his almanac, which said the period from Jan. 19 to Jan. 23 will have sunny, warm and pleasant weather in Washington, D.C., said Bobby Holt, general co chairman of the President elect's Inaugural Committee. Holt, a millionaire oil and gas tycoon and old friend of the vice president from Midland, Texas, told reporters Wednesday he couldn't recall the amateur weatherman's name and couldn't vouch for his accuracy.

Like letters to a friend, the feelings expressed in a survey of drought weary retailers reveal the hurt, despair and uncertainty gripping businesses as they struggle to survive the worst drought in decades. I love my town and the people in it, but if this continues, we are not going to be able to afford to live here, a Cavalier County retailer wrote in response to a state Tax Department survey on the drought. As the hot weather sucked the life from income producing wheat fields and pastures across the state, it dried up sales for many store owners who deal with farmers, the surveys show.

I'm not trying to paint a Pollyanna picture on the other hand, there's the famous rubber ball theory of economics: What bounced down is now bouncing up. Though an unseasonably cool, wet spring may prevent a bumper crop, the economic forecast is promising: cash income for the farm sector, which includes government subsidies, has been projected at $55 billion to $59 billion for 1990 a record if it reaches the outer limit and better than last year's estimated $54 billion.

Hog and cattle prices are at or near record levels, corn prices are up because the surplus is down, farm exports have increased, land values are expected to rise about 4 percent in 1990 about the same level they did in 1989 and machinery sales have jumped by 50 percent in the last four years.
