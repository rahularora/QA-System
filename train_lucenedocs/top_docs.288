The ZR1 costs $31,683 more than the $32,455 Corvette. That's mainly because of the ZR1's 32 valve, eight cylinder aluminum engine, which can fling the car from 0 to 60 miles per hour in just 4.3 seconds. The regular Corvette has a cast iron eight cylinder engine that produces 245 horsepower and takes an additional 1.4 seconds to get from 0 to 60 miles per hour.

Production cutbacks caused a shortage of ZR1s, which is likely to encourage dealers to demand high prices, Mr. Cedergren says.

GM denied reports earlier this year that some dealers were pressured into taking on Geo in return for getting a crack at selling the new Corvette ZR 1, production of which begins later this month in Bowling Green, Ky. Perkins said the ZR 1, with a 370 horsepower engine that can push the car from 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds, will sell for $58,995. About 3,000 of the cars will be available in the United States during the 1990 model year, mainly because of restraints by the engine maker, Mercury Marine. An undetermined number of ZR 1 Corvettes will be sold in Europe, Perkins said.

Extravagant, sporty cars with powerful engines and fancy technical frills are headline items at the 1989 Geneva Motor Show, reflecting the auto industry's buoyant confidence.

Billed as the European show most representative of the global industry, Geneva is considered a prime testing ground for automakers because of Switzerland's liberal import policy and lack of a domestic industry, which make it a highly competitive market.

The Environmental Protection Agency has ordered General Motors Corp. to recall almost half a million 1985 cars and light trucks sold under the Chevrolet, Pontiac and GMC nameplates, EPA said today. The cars exceed federal standards for carbon monoxide exhaust emissions and for evaporated gasoline, EPA said. Such orders are rare and are generally a sign the agency and the manufacturer could not agree on something, such as the cause of the problem, its scope, the necessary repair or terms of the recall.

Production during the 1990 model year of the GM minivans is expected to reach 100,000, rising to 225,000 a year subsequently as sales rise toward plant capacity.

General Motors Corp. executives today rolled out a new line of multipurpose passenger vehicles for 1990 and for the first time included an Oldsmobile MPV in its stable. William W. Lane, Oldsmobile General manager, said the utility vehicle will give Olds the chance to capitalize on the growth in the minivan market. The trend was started and is dominated largely by Chrysler Corp. Chevrolet General Manager Bob Burger said Chevrolet's Lumina, Oldsmobile's Silhouette, and the Pontiac Transport SE, will be built at the GM plant in Tarrytown, N.Y. Production of the vehicles is expected to reach 100,000 during the 1990 model year, rising to 225,000 in later years, Burger said.

Car thieves like sporty special models and in some cases they're interested in only the radio, says an insurance industry study. The cars safest from theft are small and mid sized domestics, especially station wagons. A report by the Highway Loss Data Institute said Thursday that the likelihood of theft ranges widely among cars and that the most frequent targets are Volkswagens where the radio is easy to steal and is a powerful lure.

The least likely cars to be stolen or broken into are small and mid sized domestic models, led by the Mercury Lynx, said the insurance group. According to the report, the Volkwagen GTI, which had the highest theft rate, was nearly 70 times as likely to be the target of a thief as the Lynx.
