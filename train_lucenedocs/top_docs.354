TINY worms which kill insect pests have won a joint environmental achievement award for Agricultural Genetics Company, an independent biotechnology company based in Cambridge, and Horticulture Research International, the state backed agency responsible for fruit and vegetable research, writes Clive Cookson. AGC's MicroBio subsidiary has been working for six years with HRI's Littlehampton research station in Sussex to develop natural pesticides based on nematode worms. The first two products were launched in 1989/90: Nemasys against glasshouse sciarids and Nemasys H against vine weevils.

One of the costliest crop pests of farmers and home gardeners may one day be curbed by a natural enemy, a microscopic killer worm that searches the soil for the corn rootworm, the Agriculture Department said Monday. The tiny worm, or nematode, is called Steinernema feltiae. After infecting the rootworm, the nematode releases a bacterium that kills the pest.

An absorbent material called super slurper is helping tiny worms to kill root weevils that threaten citrus trees, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday. William J. Schroeder, an entomolgist in the department's Agricultural Research Service, said the super slurper keeps soil moist so that the microscopic worms, or nematodes, can survive and kill weevils which chew the tree roots. In tests, 60 percent of the weevils were killed, compared with only 25 percent without the help of the worms.

Insect pests could be quickly and safely killed by enticing them to eat a gelatinous meal containing parasites, a biologist says. Such biogel pesticides can't harm plants, animals or the environment, but kill beetles, termites, cockroaches, boll weevils, corn rootworms, tobacco worms and other insects within days, said Frank Chang, a Temple University biology professor who developed it with graduate student Michael Gehret. Biogel is a soft material that contains an insect attractant, a feeding stimulant, food and nematodes insects' natural enemies, Chang said.

International travelers arriving at some major U.S. airports this summer will be greeted by Agriculture Department inspectors operating X ray machines to see if their baggage harbors illegal food or plants. The X rays, in addition to sharp nosed canine sniffers, will be used to check arrivals at 11 U.S. international airports for illegal sausages, mangoes and other contraband. Imported meats can carry exotic diseases that could devastate American livestock, James W. Glosser, head of the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said Wednesday.

An absorbent called super slurper invented in the 1970s is helping tiny worms kill destructive root weevils that threaten citrus trees, according to an Agriculture Department scientist. William J. Schroeder, an entomolgist in the department's Agricultural Research Service, said Wednesday the super slurper keeps soil moist so that the microscopic worms, or nematodes, can survive and kill weevils that chew the tree roots. In tests, 60 percent of the weevils were killed, compared with only 25 percent without the help of the worms.

<P> But why are you pouring worms on the lawn? asked my wife from a great distance, as I was trying to describe what nematodes are. One of the more fascinating of the new organic controls employs tiny (make that microscopic) worm like nematodes that find, attack and kill larvae living underground, or close to the ground, such as cutworms, root maggots, wireworms, the helmet headed larva of June beetles (which chomp on lawn grass roots and which were my intended target) and a host of other creatures that attack vegetables, flowers and lawns.

About 90,000 farmers who are behind in their loan repayments to the Farmers Home Administration will be getting notices shortly after the Nov. 8 election telling them to start making arrangements for settlement. The Agriculture Department agency said Tuesday the notices will be an attempt to collect about $8.8 billion in past due loans. Spokesman Marlyn Aycock said rules implementing new credit legislation will take effect Nov. 14 and that Dear Farmer Jones notices will start going out soon thereafter to the delinquent FmHA borrowers.

Agriculture Department scientists say that tiny beneficial worms, or nematodes, can be produced in a laboratory, dried out for storage and revived later to fight destructive pests in back yards. They're still living and breathing but they're dormant, says entomologist James E. Lindegran of the department's Agricultural Research Service laboratory, Fresno, Calif. Lindegran and researchers at a California biotechnology firm, Biosys, found that the microscopic nematodes such as Steinernema feltiae can be dried, stored as a paste under refrigeration and then revived with water. When you add water, the worms plump back up again, Lindegran said in a report issued here by the USDA agency.

WASHINGTON (AP) Exports of farm crops in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30 required the production from about 107 million harvested acres, according to the Agriculture Department. That represented 36 percent of the 301 million acres of crops harvested in the 1987 88 year, the department's Economic Research Service said in a new outlook report on the nation's agricultural resources. Although the 1987 88 export acreage was up 11 percent from the previous year, it was far below the record high of 137 million acres in 1980, the report said.

The finding also might lead to medicines that can be targeted against specific unwanted organisms in humans and animals, they said. It was beyond most peoples' wildest dreams to get (a pesticide system that attacked) such a significant portion of the million species of insects, the more than 100,000 types of nematodes, the tens of thousands of flatworms, and the tens of thousands of protozoans, said Leo Kim, executive vice president of research at Mycogen.

A GREAT deal of natural biological control of insect pests goes on in the garden quite naturally and without any particular help from the gardener, except the obvious one of avoiding the use of chemical or other treatments that might be harmful to the beneficial organisms. This is now well understood, and the great reduction in the usage of garden chemicals is partly due to the desire to preserve 'friendly' creatures such as ladybird larvae and lacewing flies that are valuable scavengers in the garden. What is not so well known is that some methods of biological control actually involve deliberately introducing organisms to the garden or greenhouse.

Also, nutrition researchers, athletic teams and diet spas want to know whether people on various diets are either losing or gaining fat, muscle or just water.

In short, companion planting uses several plantings in the garden at the same time for example, radishes, spring onions or leaf lettuce can be planted so rows of sweet corn, peppers or tomatoes can be sown between them. The early crops mature before the taller crops shade them too much. ; One plant may form support for another, for example, climbing green beans and tall varieties of sweet corn planted close together.

A red eyed Brazilian fly was turned loose Friday in an experimental effort to control the mole cricket, which chews up $47 million worth of crops and lawns each year. The first release of 250 fly pupae in an Alachua County pasture will probably be followed by others throughout the summer, said Howard Frank, director of the project at the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. We're optimistic, but the whole thing is a big experiment, said Frank.

A With the EPA's ban in the early 1980s of chlordane, the most widely used termiticide, and its replacement by two less harmful but still toxic chemicals, pest control specialists have come up with several non toxic alternatives for controlling termites. And, unlike earlier techniques that involved creating a barrier of toxic chemicals around the foundation of a house, researchers are working toward a termite control system involving the dissemination of chemicals into the termite colony itself to destroy the insects. Termites are said to cause about $1 billion in damage to homes and buildings in the United States each year.

Parasite infections of people who like to eat raw or undercooked fish are increasing, and the main cause is the rising population of seals and other protected marine mammals, scientists reported. Such creatures as dolphins, sea lions and seals are normally heavily infested with two types of nematodes whose eggs the mammals expel in their feces. The immature worm like larvae are then eaten by tiny shrimp like crustacea, which in turn are eaten by squid and some fish.

The new antibody, which is headed for greenhouse tests this summer on roots of barley seedlings, hopefully will seek and bind to siderophores so they can be measured and studied more fully. Eventually, it may be possible for farmers and home gardeners to make bad microbes anemic by loading the soil with certain beneficial bacteria that will deprive the pathogens of their iron supply.

THE EUROPEAN Community has banned imports of most kinds of untreated softwood lumber from Canada to protect European forests from a microscopic but voracious pest known as the pinewood nematode. The ban, which was formally notified to EC members last Friday and takes effect on Aug 15, has blown up into the most bitter current trade dispute between Canada and the EC. While EC officials regard the new rules as a plant health precaution, Canada sees them as a trade barrier.

While EC officials regard the new rules as a plant health precaution, Canada sees them as a trade barrier. The Canadians accuse the EC of over reacting to the nematode threat, thereby endangering the livelihood of many sawmill workers in the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and British Columbia.

Under the new rules, all Canadian lumber exports to Europe, with the exception of cedar, must be either kiln dried or heat treated. EC member states agreed earlier this year to allow an exemption for non pine species until October 1.

The Canadian argument has an ironic twist, in that resource industries have for years been urged to put more emphasis on adding value to commodity exports. But by heating or drying their lumber, the Canadian mills face being excluded from the large market for cheap, untreated lumber used, for instance, for cement moulds on construction sites.

The Earth's thin layer where plant roots seek water and nourishment is a world as mysterious as the distant planets, says Agriculture Department scientist Richard W. Zobel. It is this layer, or rhizosphere, that determines what kind of crops can be grown, if any, and where so many of the Earth's people can live well. Zobel, a plant geneticist, said Monday that the rhizosphere is a teeming world of minerals, gases, water and life forms insects, earthworms, microscopic nematode worms, a host of microorganisms, living and dead plant roots, and the chemicals they exude.

Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has named on campus representatives to represent the Agriculture Department at 17 historically black universities. The plan first announced in December will create a USDA liaison office at each of the schools, which are collectively known as 1890 institutions because of new land grant college legislation that year. Yeutter said Monday the top priority for the USDA representatives, all currently employed by the department in other capacities, will be to work with state and local department officials in an outreach effort to recruit minorities into agricultural and forestry studies at the schools.

Christopher Bond, R Mo., who spearheaded the senators' efforts. Other states that suffered severely from planting delays are Tennessee, Florida, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi.

Three new varieties of sweet potatoes with built in defenses against insects have been developed by Agriculture Department scientists. Most sweet potatoes have skins that naturally provide some resistance to insects and nematodes, but few have the level of resistance of these new varieties, said scientists at the Charleston, S.C., vegetable lab of USDA's Agricultural Research Service. The new sweet potato varieties are called Regal, Southern Delite and Excel.

Domestic use of rice, including large quantities to make beer, is rising enough to take up some of the slack caused by a drop in exports, the Agriculture Department says. Total U.S. production, at an estimated 154.4 million hundredweight, is about the same as last year, although yields dropped sharply in Arkansas and some other areas. All told, the U.S. rice stockpile by the end of the 1990 91 marketing year next summer may be about 23.7 million hundredweight, the smallest in a decade and only a fraction of the carryovers up to 77.6 million in 1986 in some previous years.

Exports of essential oils the kind that smell and taste good rose to an all time high last year, says the Agriculture Department. Last year's exports of essential oils reached nearly $144 million a 17 percent increase over a year earlier and well above 1987 exports of $114 million, according to an annual report. Essential oils are obtained from natural raw materials by distillation or through a mechanical pressing process.

Agricultural researchers in Iowa are reporting some success in using seeds pretreated with an insecticide to fight European corn borers, pests the government estimates cost U.S. farmers $400 million a year in damage and control expenses. Pretreating seeds with a thiodicarb solution before planting has been found as effective in controlling corn borers as any spray now on the market, yet is more economical and appears to be safer to the environment, said Edwin C. Berry of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Corn Insects Lab in Ankeny. But the process isn't ready for farm use yet.

Berry also said researchers want to know if the mechanical action of mixing the seeds with the chemical solution affects seed quality or influences the action of insecticides. In addition, the chemical seed treatment has yet to be approved for commercial use by the Environmental Protection Agency and its Des Moines developer, Gustafson Inc., says the process is still two years away from the marketplace.

In 1986 the Ministry of Public Health launched on unprecedented large scale study on parasitic infection. According to the report given in the National Survey on Distribution of Human Parasites, 62.6 percent of Chinese people are infected with 56 kinds of parasites, among them, 19 are protozoa, 16 flukes, 12 nematodes (eelworms), eight cestodes (tapeworms), and one thornheaded worm.
