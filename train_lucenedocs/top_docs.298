Scientists on Friday released 50 parasitic Israeli wasps, each smaller than a pinhead, hoping the pests would zero in on Southern California's growing ash whitefly population. The wasps were sent to work in a suburban Encino ash tree in the first of a series of tests to see if they can be used in the fight against the problem flies. This particular trial is not to see if the wasps will kill all the ash whiteflies, said Tom Bellows, a University of California, Riverside, entomologist supervising the experiment.

Drought stricken areas of the West bracing for a summer of rationed water, parched crops and forest fires now face another plague: hordes of hungry beetles, bees, crickets and grasshoppers that love hot, dry weather. California, in its fourth drought year, just finished a winter rainy season that yielded only 55 percent of normal precipitation. Water supplies to central California farmers are being cut in half, and drought cops patrol coastal cities, citing scofflaws who defy lawn watering bans.

The insects are thriving on drought stressed trees across California. Last year, they killed trees containing 2 billion board feet of timber, and state Department of Forestry officials predict a similar toll this summer. In drought conditions, the trees don't produce the amount of pitch they usually do, so when the beetles drill into the trees, they're more successful at getting in and laying their eggs, said Don Perkins, head of the forestry department's pest management program.

Lured like other visitors to California by the warm climate, record numbers of exotic insects are invading Los Angeles County and posing an unprecedented threat to the state's $16 billion a year farm economy. As of July, 1,185 potentially harmful pests have appeared in California, including fruit flies and gypsy moths, fire ants, Russian wheat aphids, Japanese beetles, mealy bugs and scales. We are being literally swamped, said Rosser W. Garrison, a county entomologist who supplied the statistics.

A century after an Agriculture Department scout found an Australian beetle that saved California's citrus crop, the government on Wednesday announced an escalation of it bug vs. bug program of biological warfare against nature's pests. The department said agreements had been reached to send American scientists to China and the Soviet Union this summer to search unexplored areas for natural enemies of destructive insects and weeds. We're raising the priority of making biocontrol a vital part of American food and fiber production, said R. Dean Plowman, head of the Agricultural Research Service.

So there's major symptoms on foliage. California Agriculture says, Populations grow to enormous densities ... often covering 100 percent of available foliage and producing substantial amounts of honeydew and sooty molds. To entomologists, appearance of the species is unique because of 40 to 50 tiny, dorsal, siphon tubes in the pupal stage.

Florida's agriculture commissioner announced Tuesday the state will begin aerial pesticide spraying to combat an infestation of Mediterranean fruit flies. A malathion compound will be sprayed by helicopter beginning Thursday in a mostly residential, 16 square mile area, commissioner Doyle Conner said at a news conference. The spraying will continue for four weeks followed by the release of millions of sterile Medflies over a 75 day period to break the breeding cycle.
