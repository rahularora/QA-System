In the seventh century, China awed the world with its exports of a fine, translucent white porcelain the same stuff, in fact, that we now call china. But the roots of that achievement stretch back to the 15th century B.C., when potters discovered that a coating of ash and water produced an impermeable bronze and jade tinted glaze after firing at high temperatures. Thus celadon porcelain named after a character in a 17th century French play ( L'Astree by Honore d'Urfe) whose costume was grayish green became the world's first hard glazed ware.

One of the most spectacular collections of Chinese art ever to be seen in this country is currently tucked behind an amusement park at the Seattle Center. But the bumper cars, carousel and cotton candy vendors form an appropriate backdrop for Son of Heaven, a show that seems a cross between a museum exhibit and a three ring circus. The vast selection of ancient bronzes, porcelains, paintings, sculptures and jewelry spans more than 2,500 years of Chinese history and includes many objects from recently excavated tombs.

Archeologists have unearthed a 2,000 year old burial site containing 40,000 pottery figurines in the ancient capital of Xian, said a report seen Wednesday in Beijing. The site is estimated to contain more than five times the number of terracotta figurines found buried with the first Chinese emperor, Qin Shi Huang Di, whose tomb is also in Xian, the Xinmin Evening News of Shanghai reported Tuesday. The discovery of the ancient army of terracotta warriors guarding Qin's tomb was one of the great archaeological finds of modern times.

Two small pyramids built for the wives of Pharoah Pepi I were discovered under mounds of sand by French scientists who say the find could shed light on a dynasty that ruled Egypt more than 2,000 years before Jesus was born. The discovery was announced Friday by members of the French Archaeological Mission at Sakkara and scientists from Electricite de France, the state owned utility which conducted a high tech exploration at the site about 20 miles south of Cairo. The Sakkara site contains the step pyramid built by King Zoser, said to be the first stone structure in history, and other pyramids.

Research found that the Yi nationality boasts 10,000 volumes of ancient publications.

Nearly 4,000 years after it was built, the funeral boat of one of Egypt's most powerful pharaohs takes another journey this week. The delicate, 32 foot long, wooden craft was gently lifted off the floor of the Field Museum of Natural History on Monday and rotated 180 degrees. Expert riggers who performed the tricky maneuver kept their hands off, fearing sweat or body oils would harm the ancient wood.

Inch by inch, with the help of expert riggers, the funeral boat of one of ancient Egypt's most powerful pharoahs took another journey Tuesday, to a new $2.2 million museum exhibit. Hydraulic jacks, dollies and a forklift were used to move the fragile, 3,847 year old wooden boat about 50 yards from a display section of the Field Museum of Natural History to an exhibit designed to recreate a pharoah's tomb. It went very well, said Suzanne Santos, a museum spokeswoman.

ON TUESDAY, Eskenazi unveils the latest in a long line of spectacular and scholarly Oriental art exhibitions to celebrate the gallery's move from a first floor in London's Piccadilly to a five storey 'Flemish Renaissance' townhouse off Bond Street, at No. 10 Clifford Street. The acquisition and refurbishment of the building cost in excess of Pounds 5m and is an expression of confidence all the more striking given that Eskenazi has no English clients.

</P> <P> Three curators George Kuwayama of LACMA, Tung Wu of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and Rosemary Scott of the Percival David Foundation have selected 58 works from a collection of 1,400 for the jewel like exhibition. It's a bit of everybody's favorites and a representative group from the collection, Scott said at a press preview. The American curators had an eye on things that are not in American collections or rarely seen here, and I pointed out the most important pieces in the collection.

Each tomb has a separate name, as does the temple within. Add to this the change in Chinese to English Romanization (Peking to Beijing, Ching ling to Jing Ling) and it's easy to see why the tombs are referred to by number, chronologically. Tomb One (Chang Ling) holds the third Ming emperor, but the first to be buried in the valley.

The humiliating removal from power of Kuwait's royal family has raised questions about how long other longtime rulers can survive in desert kingdoms carved out by the swords of their Bedouin ancestors. The Iraqi takeover of Kuwait five weeks ago showed the weakness of its emir and, by extension, of the other five conservative dynasties running the region's oil producing states. Middle East observers say the winds of political change were already blowing and that Iraq's seizure of Kuwait has set in motion forces that will spell the end of the old order one way or another.

A volcano that inspired the legend of the lost civilization of Atlantis triggered summer frost, crop failure and famine a half a world away, scientists said. The link enabled NASA scientists to date one of the most powerful volcanic eruptions in recorded history. Ancient Chinese annals tell how the climate was disrupted about 3,600 years ago after what scientists now know was the eruption of Santorini volcano, which destroyed much of the Aegean island of Thera, near what became Greece.

The main ceremonial building within the moated, 284 acre palace grounds in the center of Tokyo, the Imperial Palace was built in 1968 to replace a structure lost in a World War II firestorm caused by U.S. bombing. The palace grounds include ponds, moats and forests as well as administrative buildings and the Fukiage Mansion where Hirohito lived through his final illness. The moats, walls and some structures date from the 17th century, when the whole complex was called Edo Castle, the fortified headquarters of the Tokugawa Shogunate that then ruled Japan from Edo, the old name of Tokyo.

In mid April, it becomes one of the favorite places in Tokyo for people to picnic under what seem to be clouds of cherry blossoms. A sanctuary has been constructed for the funeral, as well as two tents 482 feet long to shelter 10,000 Japanese and foreign dignitaries from the February weather.

The death of 82 year old North Korean President Kim Il sung ends the longest rule of any political leader in the 20th century. His durability was based not only on the brute force of the authoritarian regime that he created, but also reflected his consummate political skills. Mr Kim's strength rested on his ability to appeal to Korea's strong national pride and his rule was deeply rooted in Korean tradition.

The third identified statue, made of granite, is of General Haremhab, a soldier who usurped the Egyptian throne at the end of the 18th dynasty after Tutankhamun and his caretaker Aya died. He said the Amenhophis III statue became visible as workers were cleaning. Nobody expected such a find because the area is visited by so many tourists each day, Hassan said.

On a brisk fall weekend, thousands of people streamed up a stone stairway to a 350 year old tomb honoring the man who, far more than microchips or management systems, created modern Japan. The tomb of Shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa and a gold encrusted shrine sit in a forest 70 miles northeast of Tokyo. The shogun was promoted in death from man to god and is known as Gongen sama, Protector of the Realm.
