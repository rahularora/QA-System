When it comes to representing California, the banana slug just won't do, Gov. George Deukmejian said in vetoing a bill that designated the slimy, slothful creature the state's official mollusk. The veto by the image conscious governor, announced Tuesday, squashed the hopes of a group of Blue Birds and Camp Fire girls from the San Francisco Bay area who led the campaign to make the banana slug a state mascot.

The commission, which consists of four members appointed by the state's governor, rejected the recommendation of the California Fish and Game Department, which after a year of review of the gnatcatcher's condition had strongly recommended listing the bird as endangered in order to avert its possible extinction. The commission has rarely gone against state biologists' findings on a species in the past, but the panel, by a vote of 3 to 1, held that it wasn't convinced that the bird's condition is dire enough to warrant protections. Environmentalists, led by the Natural Resources Defense Council, attacked the commission's decision and vowed to challenge it in court as early as this week.

One zoo hatched Andean condor died in transit to a wilderness area but three others survived for an experiment intended to show the best way to reintroduce endangered California condors into the wild. The surviving birds were safely placed in secret holding pens Saturday in Los Padres National Forest, and more Andean condors will be taken to the area in October, said Joe Dowhan, condor recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

The 3 and 4 month old avian pioneers, hatched and reared in zoos, will spend several weeks in mesh enclosures as scientists prepare them for their first flights over the dry mountains and foothills that once supported a thriving population of California condors. The California species a black, vulture like carrion eater with a wingspan up to 9{ feet has dwindled to a mere 28, all in captivity. Two Andean condors from the San Diego Wild Animal Park were loaded into airline style animal shipping crates Friday evening for a 200 mile trip to the secret holding pens in the Los Padres National Forest, 75 miles northeast of Los Angeles, Tom Hanscom, a spokesman for the animal park, said in a telephone interview Friday.

A hungry bundle of fluff named Molloko, the only California condor chick conceived in captivity, gobbled minced mice Saturday, and keepers of the endangered species were encouraged by its appetite.

Scientists are trying to breed enough of the birds, which can have a wingspan of nearly 10 feet, to begin returning some to their natural habitat. Wildlife officials had planned on releasing the first of the condors sometime between 1993 and 1995. But Michael Wallace, curator for birds at the Los Angeles Zoo, said the captive breeding program has achieved such success that the first birds could be released in the Los Padres National Forest next year.

Four young Andean condors are going to be introduced to the Los Padres National Forest in an experiment that wildlife experts hope will lead the way to eventually returning California condors to the wild. Scientists said Thursday they believe the information they get from monitoring the Andean condors will help them avoid problems when they begin releasing California condors in the early 1990s. There are only 28 known California condors, the largest flying birds in North America, and all of them are at the Los Angeles Zoo and the San Diego Wild Animal Park.

The Legislature, for the first time, overrode Brown's veto. In November 1978, California voters approved a death penalty initiative extending capital punishment to accomplices and other types of murders not covered by Deukmejian's legislation. Most of the controversial state Supreme Court rulings dealing with the penalty have focused on the meaning and constitutionality of the initiative.

The move was a blow to a host of big time California developers, including Irvine Cos., Baldwin Co. and Santa Margarita Co. They and other developers, who own much of what remains of the gnatcatcher habitat, have mounted a lobbying blitz in Sacramento and Washington to convince state and federal wildlife officials not to list the bird as endangered. The developers have spent more than $1 million on studies they contend refute federal and state scientists' findings that the gnatcatcher is imperiled.

Named Shasta for the volcanic California mountain that was once a range for North America's largest land bird, the chick was helped out of its shell by keepers at San Diego Wild Animal Park, said park spokesman Tom Hanscom. The egg was removed from its nest at the park's condorminium soon after it was produced April 9 by the parents of Molloko and Mandan, the first and second California condors to be born and bred in captivity. The bird's gender will be determined by a blood test, Hanscom said.

Cuyama and Cachuma, both 6 years old and new to the courting ritual, have shown an interest in each other for the past few weeks, with Cuyama waltzing around Cachuma with outstretched wings, Wallace said. We had seen attempts on (Cuyama's) part to copulate, but they were not good ones because it's his first time and he's learning how, Wallace said. The other six condor couples at the zoo also have been in courtship over the past week.

A fist sized bundle of fluff named Molloko, the first California condor chick conceived in captivity, gobbled meals of minced mice today. Everyone seems very pleased with the progress of the chick, said Martha Baker, spokeswoman for the San Diego Wild Animal Park. But the first 10 days are critical, for anybody, human or animal.

They are part of an experiment to test methods that researchers plan to use when they release a group of endangered California condors into the wild in the 1990s.

The accidental release of at least 175,000 gallons of a particularly gooey form of crude oil has turned from a minor inconvenience into a major menace to fragile bird rookeries and a major sports fishing industry. This is a sin, a crime against God's creation, and makes a city boy want to cry, said Joseph Hallachi, 43, of Santa Cruz, who drove 120 miles to voluntarily help state crews remove oil from a city park shoreline. The April 23 spill already has killed 200 birds and small animals and left 250 others suffering ill effects.

The April 23 spill already has killed 200 birds and small animals and left 250 others suffering ill effects. The spill of San Joaquin crude from Shell Oil Co.'s major Northern California refinery occurred after a broken storm drain pipe running through the middle of an oil tank allowed crude to be siphoned out.

They have been busy along a 15 mile stretch of waterway from the Carquinez Strait to the mouth of the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta, with their major sport fishing industry, and at Peyton Slough marsh and Ryer Island, critical wildlife habitat for the endangered clapper rail and dozens of other bird species, including various ducks, blue heron, black rail and California brown pelican.
