Innovations expected to propel the manufacturing industry into the future, including video headsets and floating concrete, are on display at the National Design Engineering Show and Conference. About 25,000 engineers are expected to converge on Chicago's lakefront McCormick Place through Thursday to see new designs from companies such as Dow Chemical Co. and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. even NASA. Many of the products and materials on display represent minor advances a fiber that resists fading just a bit longer, for example.

This year Lucinda Childs, one of the most acclaimed Judson graduates, is making a first British visit with her company. Sophie Constanti reported here on her Edinburgh Festival debut; on Tuesday night, as the Dance Umbrella season got under way, Miss Childs and her troupe came to the South Bank a glum and not inapt location. The Childs manner offers small cells of activity which repeat and repeat, re align and slowly mutate it is no accident that she uses minimalist scores as accompaniment so that the viewer is made aware of a cumulative structure.

This building blocks approach to dance would be more fascinating as the Shades entry in Bayadere is fascinating in its repetitions and augmentation were the blocks themselves of interest.

But to pile up banalities, to shift their direction, to pass them among a cast like so many tiny austerities, is not so much architecture as parsimony.

The major piece in Tuesday's programme was Available Light, almost an hour of routines set below and on a bridge structure. First made as a museum installation in Los Angeles a decade ago, it has a score by John Adams which is vastly more enterprising in the working out of its patterns than Childs' movement sequences.

This group has a very clear focus and the results are startling, Mr. Drucker said. Some 809 nonprofit groups applied for the award, administered by a nonprofit foundation and research center that Mr. Drucker started last year. He said he established the annual award because many nonprofit organizations, particularly small ones, aren't recognized and encouraged enough for their social contributions and management strategies.

personalized advertising in its weekly magazines is expected to pull in an extra $20 million to $25 million in ad revenue in its first year alone, says Donald M. Elliman Jr., the magazine group's executive vice president of marketing. The figure is surprisingly large for a start up program, and shows just how important the new plan will be in generating ad revenue for the magazine group in the 1990s. Indeed, Time magazine group officials are already planning to expand the program, which premieres in January, to include more magazines and types of ads.

</P> <P> Talmi wisely saved the major decibels for the thunderous climax of the last movement, which displayed the orchestra's more resonant forte of the season. Although the horns, expanded to eight for this symphony given to stentorian outbursts, acquitted their tasks honorably, the trumpets under the brilliant leadership of principal Calvin Price proved to be the thoroughbreds of the Mahler brass. </P> <P> Talmi's Mozart was less successful than his Mahler, but it was not all his fault.

Fourteen mothers who were once on welfare have found jobs doing what they know best being moms. The women have been taken off government assistance and receive $21,000 annual salaries for being foster mothers to disabled children under a state program called LIFE, or Living in Family Environments. These women are capable of doing something, but for the most part they're best at being moms, and they're happy being moms, said state Rep. Shirley Johnson, who helped win funding for the program.

Mark Hughes, of the state's AIDS office, said one of the primary reasons for the new rules was to assist people who wish to be treated with AZT. With wider acceptance of the drug, the philosophy of testing is changing; more people are being tested so they can avail themselves of the drug. Beginning in January, even without Proposition 102, California doctors will be allowed to inform other medical personnel, as well as sexual and needle sharing partners, about HIV exposure, without revealing the source of that exposure.

Beginning in January, even without Proposition 102, California doctors will be allowed to inform other medical personnel, as well as sexual and needle sharing partners, about HIV exposure, without revealing the source of that exposure. Proposition 102 goes further. It requires doctors to report to health authorities the names of all people infected, or reasonably suspected of being infected, with HIV; mandates that those infected provide lists of their sexual and IV drug partners, and requires health officers to locate and counsel those partners; permits employers or insurers to use HIV tests; and lets doctors test a patient's blood without his consent.

The almanac also forecasts a generally warmer spring and summer than normal, but a cool and wet fall. The almanac says its forecasts are based on a combination of a secret formula devised by its founder and the most modern scientific calculation based on solar activity. Hale also strays into earthquake forecasts, noting that the moon will be 221,545 miles from the Earth on New Year's Eve, closer than its average of 251,000 miles.

Believers argue that when the moon is closer and its gravitational pull is stronger, there is greater stress on rock layers that might rupture and cause a quake.

After watching his half acre of grass wither and dry this spring, Witham Smith wrote a letter to the Old Farmer's Almanac. Smith, a regular reader of the almanac, asked whether the 196 year old publication's forecasters, having missed the Midwest's drought, could at least predict the dry spell's end. He received a pretty dry answer from Judson D. Hale Sr., editor of the almanac.
