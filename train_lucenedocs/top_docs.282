Cornell University scientists note the advantages of biological controls: There is no environmental damage; the pests do not develop resistance to their predators as they do to chemicals, and a small initial investment results in a safe, permanent control method.

Also, scientists face delays while they work to show the government that their controls are harmless to all but the pest. The Mexican mite, being tested at the University of Rhode Island, was quarantined for six months before scientists could prove it was a species known in this country.

Eating in a social setting increases the duration of the meal.

Encarsia formosa, Mr. van Lenteren admits, is a rather stupid animal in several respects. Peering through their microscopes, entomologists noted that the wasp kept stumbling into the minute hairs on cucumber leaves as it looked for white fly larvae. It's like a drunken man on a sidewalk with many lamp posts, Mr. van Lenteren explains.

Back in the 1870s, a destructive insect known as the cottony cushion scale arrived on the West Coast from Australia and began sucking on California's fledgling citrus crops. A decade or so later, the Agriculture Department imported some Vedalia beetles, or Australian ladybugs, natural enemies of the scale in Australia, which didn't have problems with the cottony cushion scale. Within months, the scale was vanquished and California went on to become famous for groves of oranges, lemons and other citrus.

The American Farm Bureau Federation says legislation to raise federal minimum wage levels would eliminate jobs, increase unemployment and raise the cost of food to consumers. Federation president Dean Kleckner said last week in a letter to Congress that the proposed wage increase would inevitably produce upward pressure on all wages paid and that will increase prices of agricultural products. House and Senate labor committees have approved similar versions, raising the federal minimum wage to $4.65 per hour from $3.35 currently.

If piece rates have to be increased substantially to make it possible for less skilled, less experienced workers to earn the new minimum, farmers will seek to find workers with greater skills and experience, and reduce the number of workers hired, he said.

Elementary school pupils set free 7,000 ladybugs in what their principal called an ecological alternative to an annual balloon launch. Balloons, with notes attached, are often released by school and community groups eager to see how far their messages will travel. Many wind up in fields and wetlands, where the balloons can be fatal to foraging wildlife.

The department said agreements had been reached to send American scientists to China and the Soviet Union this summer to search unexplored areas for natural enemies of destructive insects and weeds. We're raising the priority of making biocontrol a vital part of American food and fiber production, said R. Dean Plowman, head of the Agricultural Research Service. Taiwanese born pathologist Yang Shaw Ming will go to Inner Mongolia in search of a fungus that can destroy the leafy spurge, an aggressive weed which drives grazing cattle and horses away from rangeland at a cost to ranchers that he estimated at $50 million.

The seed extract is the latest example of a growing array of pest control technologies that rely on biological mechanisms instead of manufactured chemicals. As more pests develop resistance to traditional synthetics, and more consumers become concerned about pesticide health risks, many chemical makers are accelerating efforts to produce natural alternatives. The extract, known as azadirachtin, comes from seeds of the neem tree, a tropical mahogany.

The unlikely saviours of British cereal farming may be the humble beetles which prey on aphids, cereal's natural enemy. The traditional response to the threat of aphids has been spraying, usually two or three times a year and at enormous cost. But since 1984, British scientists have been testing ways of stimulating the population of natural predators, such as beetles, ladybirds, hoverflies and spiders.

Scientists on Friday released 50 parasitic Israeli wasps, each smaller than a pinhead, hoping the pests would zero in on Southern California's growing ash whitefly population. The wasps were sent to work in a suburban Encino ash tree in the first of a series of tests to see if they can be used in the fight against the problem flies. This particular trial is not to see if the wasps will kill all the ash whiteflies, said Tom Bellows, a University of California, Riverside, entomologist supervising the experiment.

Bellows released the imported predators into what he calls a sleeve cage, a finely woven mesh cloth fitted over a tree branch so that all of the wasps will remain in one place.

When growers drive up to the food processing plant, people sample the beans and bite marks, and if the ratio is too high, the company will tell the grower, We'll have to process this batch differently,' so the growers makes less money. Farmers are spraying less because pesticides costs are rising and alternate pest management strategies are working, Burgett said. Much of the spraying that remains is for appearance, and that won't change until consumers stop being so squeamish about bugs, he said.

A contraption that sucks bad bugs off strawberry plants may become a handy tool for farmers in the drive to kill pests without using so many chemicals. Three farming members of Driscoll Strawberry Associates Inc. of Watsonville, in northern California, are using a company designed machine called a BugVac this year to vacuum lygus bugs off their plants. The custom made vacuum machine, mounted on a tractor, moves down rows of young berries, providing just enough suction to zap lygus bugs that like to live near the top of the plants.

A special hit team of lady beetles and wasps has been imported from the Soviet Union to help American farmers battle the Russian wheat aphid, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday. The predator insects are natural enemies of the aphid, and after evaluation may be used in field tests against the destructive pests. In all, three species of wasps and four species of lady beetles were collected during May and June in the southern region of the Soviet Union, the department's Agricultural Research Service reported.

The predator insects are natural enemies of the aphid, and after evaluation may be used in field tests against the destructive pests.

The genetic engineering feat is so promising, Monsanto has been conducting field trials of cotton plants incorporating the Bt gene for two years. But a group of entomologists from the University of Hawaii say they have documented cases in Hawaiian watercress fields in which the diamondback moth, a common pest, has developed strong resistance to insecticide sprays containing a Bt toxin. The results of our study put to rest the notion that Bt will be a permanent solution to our pest problems, said Bruce Tabashnik, professor of entomology and one of the researchers, There was a perception until recently that insects won't develop resistance to Bt as they have to chemical pesticides.
