Another frequently overlooked point is that although 16 states have enacted minimum wage levels above the current federal minimum of $3.35, not one has a minimum at or above $5.05. A minimum wage of $5.05 would require even the high minimum wage states of California and Connecticut to increase their mandated minimums by 19%.

Kennedy's proposal includes Puerto Rico, but permits the country to exempt itself if the island's minimum wage board certifies to the labor secretary that there is a substantial finding of unemployment. In introducing his substitute bill, Kennedy said the current minimum wage has fallen to its lowest point since its inception 50 years ago, with today's minimum of $3.35 per hour representing only 36 percent of the average hourly earnings.

Historically, he said, the minimum has been maintained at a figure of one half the hourly average. Congressional action to restore the minimum wage is long overdue, he said. Thurmond said, however, said he was opposed to a significant increase in the minimum wage because it is inflationary, it reduces entry level and part time jobs for teen agers and unskilled workers, as well as decreases services to consumers.

Quayle said he would propose an amendment which would increase the minimum wage to $4 and combine it with a reform of the earned income tax credit, similar to an approach presented in the House Labor Committee by Rep. Tom Petri, R Wis., but rejected by the panel.

Congressional Democrats are poised to act on compromise legislation to increase the federal minimum wage of $3.35 per hour by $1.20 over the next three years. The task will not be easy, though, if Republicans are able to anything about it. The Senate Labor Committee voted 11 5 Wednesday to approve legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $4.55 per hour by 1991.

Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin today said a proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $5.05 an hour over the next four years may sound like the right thing to do but it actually would cause a loss of jobs. Mrs. McLaughlin said the proposed increase, likely to be approved next week by the House Education and Labor Committee, would be particularly hard on young people with no skills who are seeking their first jobs. This is a tough one.

The House voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early 1981, casting a solid 382 37 vote for a compromise measure backed by President Bush. The vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor. Advocates said the 90 cent an hour rise, to $4.25 an hour by April 1991, is too small for the working poor, while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs.

The Senate, on a 61 39 vote largely along party lines, backed an amendment to legislation sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D Mass., that brought the measure essentially in line with a House passed bill that would boost the minimum wage to $4.55 by October 1991. Rejected, by 58 41, was Bush's proposal to increase the minimum wage by 30 cents a year from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.25 in January 1992.

If there is any one thing that the 101st Congress must do it is to increase the minimum wage, said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D Maine, chastising Bush for opposing a $4.55 an hour minimum wage while supporting expanded capital gains tax breaks for the wealthy. This legislation will be a test of whether we indeed are seeking a kindler, gentler nation, said Mitchell. Both the defeated Bush proposal and the amended Kennedy bill contain provisions allowing some workers to be paid a wage below the federal minimum wage.

The increase, the first since 1981, would bring the wage to $4.25 an hour by April 1991, after going to an intermediate $3.80 on April 1, 1990. The new law also includes a lower training wage for new workers who are teen agers, a provision sought by Bush but initially opposed by congressional Democrats.

Jesse Helms, R N.C, citing studies that a higher minimum wage likely would fuel inflation and make marginal businesses less likely to hire new workers. So what do politicians do?

Senate Democrats on Friday reduced the size of the increase they are asking in the minimum wage but not enough for President Bush who vowed again to veto any raise of more than 90 cents over three years. In the second day of debate on the measure, Democrats cut by a dime to $4.55 the minimum wage they want in effect by October 1991 compared with the current $3.35 and agreed for the first time to a 60 day subminimum for workers who are new on the job. Bush, however, declared he had no intention of budging one inch on allowing a minimum wage that high or on accepting that short a period during which employers could pay a training wage 20 percent below the federal floor.

The House voted 248 171 Thursday in favor of legislation that would raise the minimum wage from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.55 by October 1991, with the first increase taking effect later this year. The House then joined the Senate on an Easter recess that ends April 3.

The House today overwhelmingly approved legislation to raise the hourly minimum wage to $4.25 by April 1991 and establish a lower training wage for some teen agers new to the job market. The 382 37 vote came just a day after the White House and Democratic congressional leaders reached agreement on the plan, which would provide the first increase in the $3.35 minimum wage since 1981. President Bush vetoed an earlier bill to raise the minimum wage to $4.55 an hour, and the Democratic controlled House sustained the veto.

The Bush administration urged Republican senators Tuesday not to undermine a compromise to increase the minimum wage by seeking to amend the deal. A final vote on the plan was delayed until Wednesday morning by congressional action to increase the government's debt ceiling. Because of the delay, it was unclear whether several GOP senators said to be mulling amendments would honor the administration's request, delivered in a letter to the Senate from Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole.

Only President Bush's promised signature is needed for the first minimum wage increase in nearly a decade, following Congress' lopsided approval of a bill raising the rate to $4.25 by April 1991. The measure which includes a subminimum wage for teen agers new to the job market cleared the Senate on an 89 8 vote Wednesday, exactly a week after it passed the House by an equally overwhelming vote of 382 37. Bush, who struck the compromise plan with congressional Democrats last week, is expected to sign the bill before Thanksgiving, perhaps as early as next week.

The Bush administration is heading toward a confrontation with Senate Democrats over sharply differing plans to raise the $3.35 an hour minimum wage, with the possibility of the first increase in eight years in the balance. $4.25 is it, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole told Congress on Friday, warning that President Bush would veto any attempt to fatten the hourly increase that the administration would phase in over three years. Mrs. Dole said the raise to $4.25 must also be coupled with a sub minimum training wage for the first six months employment for all newly hired workers.

The Democratic controlled House Labor and Education Comittee bowed Tuesday to President Bush's rejection of anything more than a $4.25 minimum wage. But it coupled the 90 cent increase in the present $3.35 an hour wage floor with restrictions on the 80 percent subminimum training wage that Bush is demanding a move that administration officials say will prompt another veto.

Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D Mass., offered an amendment to his bill raising the minimum wage from its current $3.35 an hour to $4.55 an hour by 1991 that would allow employers to hire up to 12 students instead of the six now allowed for up to 20 hours a week at 85 percent of the minimum wage.

Kennedy's bill would raise by 40 cent increments each year to $3.75 in 1989, $4.15 in 1989 and $4.55 in 1990 a total of 35.8 percent over the three years. It also would increase the exemption for small businesses from the current threshold of $362,000 in gross sales to $500,000. According to Labor Department figures, about 6.7 million workers were paid the minimum wage or less in 1986.

Republicans and conservative Democrats who sustained President Bush's veto of an increase in the minimum wage are pushing the White House to compromise on a scaled back version of the bill. Administration officials, however, are sending mixed signals, floating possible concessions one day but insisting the next that Bush won't budge from last spring's best, first and only offer. Compromise or not, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D Mo., said Thursday that a bill raising the wage floor to $4.25 from the $3.35 level where it's been since 1981 will be voted on Wednesday.

The White House has entered the congressional fray over a proposed increase in the minimum wage, arguing that it could cost 850,000 jobs while adding to the budget deficit. Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors, says even the smallest increase under consideration, raising the minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.65 per hour by 1992, would cost 600,000 jobs. Those losses would be concentrated among younger, less skilled and minority workers, he said.

Eleven states have laws mandating minimum wages higher than the current federal floor; a few of them already are at the $4.25 level. Despite the lopsided vote, lawmakers from both parties found fault with the compromise. Democrats complained the increase was too small and the subminimum created a dangerous two tiered wage system.

House Republicans and conservative Democrats who sustained President Bush's veto in June of a minimum wage increase struggled Thursday to find a compromise that would avoid another showdown next week. But the White House, in a meeting with leaders of the two parties, refused to budge on Bush's demand for a six month subminimum training wage and labor leaders balked at accepting anything less than a $4.25 minimum wage by January 1991. Whether a compromise is reached or not, Democratic leaders plan to bring to the House floor next Wednesday a scaled back $4.25 version of the bill that Bush vetoed, which would have set a $4.55 an hour minimum wage with a 60 day subminimum training wage.

Bush administration officials say Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole will outline a proposal to raise the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour over three years and create an hourly 'training wage of $3.35 at a Senate hearing today. The plan is to be presented before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, whose chairman Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D Mass., has introduced legislation calling for a hike in the minimum wage to $4.55 to be accompanied by automatic periodic increases in the future. Mrs. Dole's testimony is expected to set the stage for a renewed battle between the administration and congressional Democrats who opposed the training wage last year as a sub minimum wage that organized labor says might threaten the jobs of higher paid workers.

Senate sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the bill could be brought up there within the next three weeks. Just before Congress recessed in August, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee again approved the same $4.55 minimum wage bill Bush had vetoed, although senators said it would likely be modified on the Senate floor. Bush, like former President Ronald Reagan, has insisted on establishing a subminimum floor that would allow employers to pay any newly hired worker 20 percent less for up to six months, regardless of the worker's previous job experience.

Both Republicans and Democrats indicated a willingness Tuesday to negotiate over their differences on the duration of the subminimum period, but neither side is budging on who the lower floor applies to.

Both Republicans and Democrats indicated a willingness Tuesday to negotiate over their differences on the duration of the subminimum period, but neither side is budging on who the lower floor applies to. Rep. Austin Murphy, D Pa., said Bush's proposal would allow employers to pay a $3.40 subminimum wage perpetually by rotating new hires in and out every 60 days to six months.

The author of the Senate passed bill to raise the minimum wage says President Bush runs a high political risk with voters by vetoing the measure, while Republicans say the president must prove his ability to stand firm. I hope we still can reach agreement with the president, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy said Wednesday night after his proposal to raise the hourly minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.55 by October 1991 cleared the Senate on a 62 37 vote. If that's not the case, we'll see the president and those who support the president's position at the polls, said Kennedy, D Mass.

Senate leaders today urged colleagues to stop using delaying tactics preventing final passage of a compromise plan to raise the hourly minimum wage to $4.25. Both Majority Leader George Mitchell and Republican leader Bob Dole called on any senators who plan to offer amendments to the proposal to come forward. A few senators have indicated they might propose amendments, and debate has been all but stopped because none has actually done so.
