Gene Dewey, Molycorp's president, said future demand appears weak. Current spot prices for molybdenum are $2.10 and $2.15 a pound, compared with $3.60 a pound in 1989.

Cyprus Minerals Co. said it has agreed in principle to buy Foote Mineral Co. for about $90 million. Foote is 82% owned by Newmont Mining Corp., which has said it would seek to sell some businesses to reduce the huge debt incurred in its successful effort to squelch a takeover bid by Ivanhoe Partners, an investment group led by T. Boone Pickens. The sale of Foote would be Newmont's first sale under that plan, although the company has also said it is considering selling its 75% stake in Newmont Australia Ltd., a gold mining concern.

Denver based Cyprus said it is seeing improvement in copper production costs, but the mining company doesn't expect 1990 earnings to be higher than 1989 earnings. For all of 1989, Cyprus earned $250.1 million on revenue of $1.79 billion. The large earnings drop indicates how vulnerable the company's earnings still are to fluctuations in copper prices, despite efforts to diversify into other kinds of mining ventures over the past five years.

The large earnings drop indicates how vulnerable the company's earnings still are to fluctuations in copper prices, despite efforts to diversify into other kinds of mining ventures over the past five years. Each one cent increase in copper production costs, or one cent decrease in the price of copper, results in a 10 cent a share decline in annual earnings for Cyprus, said R.

Amax Inc. agreed to acquire Falconbridge Ltd. under a proposed tender offer valued at 2.85 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.42 billion), or C$36.125 a share. The move would make Amax one of the world's six largest base metal producers. The surprise pact between Amax, a big Greenwich, Conn. based aluminum, coal, and gold mining concern, and Falconbridge, a large producer of nickel, copper, and zinc, appears designed to thwart a yearlong creeping takeover of Falconbridge by Noranda Inc., a resource giant indirectly controlled by Toronto financiers Edward and Peter Bronfman.

Past glories and future dreams of this economically depressed mining town two miles up in the Rocky Mountains are pinned to a bill now inching its way through Congress. The measure aims to bless the National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum, now housed in the old Lake County junior high school here in Leadville, with a federal charter. Such a charter brings no bucks but would qualify the museum for inclusion on lists of national historical sites and maps and other official documents and museum boosters believe that will lure thousands of mining buffs.

IN A dramatic policy U turn, the Indian federal government has decided to allow private sector participation in the exploration for and mining of 13 minerals hitherto reserved to public sector operations. The minerals are iron ore, manganese, chrome, sulphur, gold, diamond, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, tungsten, nickel and the platinum group. Under the new order, Indian public and private sector mining companies will be allowed 50 per cent foreign equity participation on an automatic basis.

Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO <F P=106> [Article by Yasushi Uchida] </F> [Text] The Central Research Institute of Matsushita Electric Works, Ltd. (Matsushita Electric), jointly with Professor Koichi Niihara at the Industrial Science Research Institute of Osaka University, has developed new nano composites in which nm size, microfine molybdenum particles are uniformly dispersed in a matrix of yttria/partially stabilized zirconia (Y PSZ or Y TZP). With the addition of nano microparticles of molybdenum to comparatively strong and tough PSZ to form the composite, the material manifested strength and toughness equivalent to those of super hard alloys and corrosion resistance nearly equal to that of ceramics, according to the Functional Material Laboratory of the Central Research Institute. Within the next two to three years, Matsushita Electric plans to use the composite for electric tools' cutting edges and barber's equipment, including electric razors.

It is conjectured that PSZ crystal grains form nano particles by incorporating molybdenum micro particles inside. The mechanical properties of the newly developed composite are strongly influenced by the amount of added molybdenum. The composite's bending strength increases as the molybdenum addition increases from zero through 30 volume percent, above which the strength does not change significantly (Figure 2).

The composite's bending strength increases as the molybdenum addition increases from zero through 30 volume percent, above which the strength does not change significantly (Figure 2). The composite's toughness, on the other hand, hardly increases until the molybdenum amount reaches 30 volume percent, and rapidly increases as soon as the molybdenum amount exceeds 30 volume percent.

When the nano particles precipitate inside zirconia particles, the structure of zirconia becomes finer, and the composite's strength increases.

For copper companies, sluggish molybdenum prices combined with a 13.5% decline in average copper prices from the year earlier quarter to produce significantly lower earnings. Demand for copper was weaker during the latest quarter, generally as a result of the North American recession, resulting in an average price of about $1.03 a pound, compared with $1.19 a pound a year earlier. Prices slipped below $1 for June, the lowest monthly average price since August 1988, says John E. Gross, the West Nyack, N.Y., publisher of the Copper Journal.

ALUMINIUM PRODUCERS had only themselves to blame for present excess supply, high stocks and low prices, suggested Mr Ivor Kirman, marketing director of Inco Europe, yesterday. He said metals businesses could broadly be classified into two groups those run by optimists and those run by realists. 'Metals (industries) which were run by optimists typically have expanded capacity too fast, now have more than 30 per cent over capacity and have built up substantial finished stocks.

Amax Inc. said it will temporarily suspend operation of the ammonium paratungstate plant in Fort Madison, Iowa, that it operates for Canada Tungsten Mining Corp. The metals and minerals company said it is closing the tungsten operation because of poor market conditions and because Canada Tungsten has adequate inventories to sustain its planned reduced level of sales for a considerable period of time. A company spokesman said the suspension wouldn't have a material effect on Amax's financial results.

AMAX, the third largest US aluminium producer, is halving its quarterly dividend to 10 cents a share because of 'abnormally low' prices for the metal. The company will also take charges totalling Dollars 399m after tax, partly offset by a Dollars 192m income tax benefit. Mr Allen Born, chairman, estimates Amax, which makes about two thirds of its earnings from aluminium, will suffer a fourth quarter loss of about Dollars 50m before special provisions.

The U.S., of course, is a large and diverse country. Some states always do better than others because they supply goods and services that happen, at a particular time, to be in strong demand.

Hanson acquired 45% of Peabody last month for $504 million from three other companies. In March, Hanson had announced a plan to buy the remaining 55% of Peabody for $715 million from Newmont Mining Corp. Hanson acquired a 49% stake in Newmont by buying Consolidated Gold Fields Ltd. last August. Hanson's agreement with Newmont allows other bidders to top its offer for all of Peabody before the purchase is completed in June, to make sure Newmont's public holders receive a fair price.

In 1989, Amax extracted more than $100 million in gold, and made a profit of $64 million, even after allowing for depreciation and depletion.

THE PHILIPPINES offered some of the world's best exploration opportunities because there had been so little mineral exploration in the past decade, said Mr Tony Robbins, a Western Mining Corporation exploration manager, yesterday. Even though the country was very well endowed with copper, gold and other minerals, it had been left behind when the rest of the world was experiencing a gold driven exploration boom. This presented mining companies with 'a window of opportunity which no longer exists in many parts of the world'.
