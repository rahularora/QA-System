Underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard, whose deep sea robot discovered the German battleship Bismarck on the bottom of the Atlantic two weeks ago, said today he believed the World War II vessel had been scuttled by its own crew. At a news conference to disclose details of the discovery, Ballard said the condition of the ship confirmed for him the theory that the vessel was scuttled rather than sunk by British fire in one of the most famous and important naval engagements of the war. Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one piece, Ballard said.

A deep sea inspection of the Bismarck suggests that the most powerful battleship in Adolf Hitler's navy was scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the British in a celebrated battle, underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard said Thursday. During a 90 minute news conference, Ballard described how he his ocean crawling robot located the Bismarck sitting upright and proud two weeks ago. Then the American oceanographer, whose father was of British background and whose mother was of German heritage, addressed himself to the German people in German.

But the problem is, those reports can be off by a mile or more, and a mile at sea, when you're looking at the sea floor, represents a very large area to be covered in a search.

Underwater scientist Robert D. Ballard is becoming host of National Geographic Explorer on SuperStation TBS because he says the movie and television image of scientists is driving young people away from science careers. We're going to change the show's emphasis to more live exploration, said Ballard, the man who found the Titanic and the Bismarck and recently led an expedition to a sunken Roman ship. That effort was telecast live to several hundred thousand youngsters in 12 museums across the country.

It was a grim coincidence that the first comprehensive exhibition of artefacts recovered from the Titanic opened at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich a few days after the sinking of the ferry Estonia. The fascination surrounding the loss of the supposedly unsinkable Titanic, on its maiden voyage, was overshadowed by the shock of the sinking of a modern ferry at a cost of more than 900 lives. The Titanic went down after it struck an iceberg off Newfoundland on April 14, 1912.

Slipping out of its home port of Danzig (now Gdynia) on May 18, 1941 to attack Allied convoys, the Bismarck soon had much of the British Royal Navy looking for it. At the time England faced a victorious Germany alone and was dependent on convoys from America for most of its food and war material. Discovered by two British heavy cruisers </P> <P> on May 23, the Bismarck was engaged the next day by two other British warships.

Lord died in 1962, claiming to the end that the Titanic was in an icefield 20 miles or more from his ship and that he was unable to help. A campaign to clear his name has been carried on by his son and other supporters, and an earlier petition to reopen the inquiry was rejected in 1965.

World shipping leaders have given the go ahead for the introduction of new, automatic communications that will mean the end of the Morse code for ships at sea. The Global Maritime Distress and Safety System transmits and receives automatically, so Morse will no longer be a requirement for ships. Shipowners are expected to phase out radio operators when the new equipment is installed in ships, starting in 1993.

Seaman Adolf Eich crawled through a narrow tunnel inside the burning battleship Bismarck, scrambling for his life as British forces bombarded the Third Reich's most dreaded fighting vessel. Eich, a survivor of one of the most famous battles in naval history, recounted his tale Wednesday after American explorers found the sunken battleship under 2.8 miles of water 600 miles off the coast of France. The Bismarck went down on May 27, 1941, ending a furious pursuit by British warships and aircraft defending the Allies' crucial supply lines with Europe.

The discoverers of the sunken Titanic announced a venture Wednesday designed to bring undersea exploration of a Roman shipwreck to thousands of students across the country via live television. Robert Ballard, who led the team that found the Titanic in 1985, said students, linked by satellite to at least nine science museums in the United States and Canada, will be able to communicate with explorers directing an unmanned mobile camera as it combs the Mediterranean Sea floor. While the $6 million, privately funded project involves several advances in technology, Ballard said its main purpose is to excite students about science.

A research vessel that was part of the Titanic exploration, seized under the government's zero tolerance policy after a small amount of marijuana was found, will probably be returned to its owners, officials say. Atlantis II was seized here Wednesday after a routine inspection turned up traces of marijuana and two pipes in the shaving kit of one of the ship's 25 crew members, a U.S. Customs Service spokesman said Thursday. Spokesman Mike Fleming said it was clear the 210 foot vessel's owners, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Mass., were innocent parties.

A popular robot was relegated to the sidelines, but thousands of excited schoolchildren still watched in awe as a $7 million science project lit up screens nationwide, whisking viewers to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. The satellite relayed view from a camera equipped submersible robot Monday was the first of two weeks of live broadcasts to an expected 250,000 students at 13 museums from British Columbia to Florida. The project suffered a temporary setback last week when Jason, the 7 foot long robot whose older brother first explored the sunken Titanic, sank among the ruins of an ancient Roman trading ship off the coast of Italy.

Researching the disaster has been difficult because newspapers of the day were still primarily concerned with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln two weeks earlier and with the end of the war.

The Coast Guard's failure to require life rafts and signal beacons on small, commercial passenger boats contributed to the loss of life in the sinking of a vessel off the Oregon coast, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded Tuesday. It was the first time the board has cited what it considers a laxity in Coast Guard regulations as a contributory cause to an accident it investigated. The board, on a 3 0 vote with one member absent, placed primary blame for the accident on the vessel's captain, who was not identified.

The 1865 explosion of the paddlewheeler Sultana was a disaster to rival the sinking of the Titanic, and the muddy Mississippi River coughed up burned and bloated bodies for weeks afterward. But until Sunday, no memorial had been created in this onetime Confederate stronghold for the Union soldiers who perished aboard the steamship, many of them emaciated survivors of Confederate prison camps during the Civil War. Before a small crowd of about 50 people, a 6 foot granite marker was unveiled in Memphis' Elmwood Cemetery as a reminder that the Sultana went down in flames just seven miles north of the city's downtown riverfront.

There are three specific tasks to hermetically seal the nose section of the Komsomolets nuclear submarine using special titanium patches, monitor the radiation and environmental situation in the area, investigate the technical state of the submarine, and search for the rescue chamber.
