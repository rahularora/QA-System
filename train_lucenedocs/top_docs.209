A 22{ foot tall paper clip was unveiled outside a business college Monday to honor the Norwegian who invented the office helper 90 years ago. The paper clip, weighing a desk crushing 1,320 pounds, is a faithful copy of Norwegian Johan Vaaler's 1899 invention, said Per Langaker of the Norwegian School of Management. The paper clip is 100 percent accurate and fully functional if anyone has big enough paper, said Langanker, 23, of the school's student committee.

Taking a rare active role in an ongoing federal investigation, President Reagan told top law enforcement officials Thursday to move as rapidly as possible to get the facts in a burgeoning Pentagon fraud investigation. Reagan, who told Congress two years ago that he did not want lawmakers scrutinizing every paper clip, bolt and bullet in the defense budget, was described by spokesman Marlim Fitzwater as very concerned about allegations of bribe paying and kickbacks. I think we're all aware of the wide scope of this investigation, Fitzwater said, and it certainly poses an internal security problem and an abuse problem of dimensions that have to be dealt with forthrightly.

Moody denied any connection with the bombs, his lawyer said.

Economists and traders are bracing for a period of adjustment as the government returns to seasonally adjusting the monthly merchandise trade data. But seasonal factors or not, the consensus view holds that the April trade deficit due out tomorrow widened, backtracking a bit on recent progress. The average estimate of 10 economists in a Dow Jones Capital Markets Report poll called for a seasonally adjusted $12.20 billion gap, up from an adjusted $11.95 billion gap in March.
