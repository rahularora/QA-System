Frederic Remington, the painter and sculptor best known for his depiction of the Wild West, deserves recognition as an American master, say the curators of a traveling exhibit of his work that opens here today. Remington has been seen superficially, says Michael Edward Shapiro, chief curator at the St. Louis Art Museum. He's been stereotyped as a cowboy artist when he was a very sophisticated New Yorker who drew from a lot of sources and created his own style, which has astonishingly imprinted itself on the conscience of our country.

Sitting Bull, who had ignominiously defeated Gen. Custer at the Little Bighorn, became Buffalo Bill's friend. After promising Sitting Bull that he would persuade the president to come talk to him in person about Indian grievances, Buffalo Bill can only produce three pompous, insensitive senators. Attempting, finally, to effect some compromise between the government and Sitting Bull, he must stand by helplessly as Sitting Bull is brutally assassinated and a few days later his Sioux Indian followers are massacred at Wounded Knee.

<P> Whenever Larry McMurtry sits down at the campfire of modern fiction, a wild cast of characters soon amble in from the shadows, and their compelling yarns quickly edge any weighty issues into the background. So it is in this tale of Martha Jane Canary, better known as Calamity Jane, as she and her companeros ramble across their old stompin' grounds, from the great plains of the Dakotas to the mountains of Montana and Wyoming, aimlessly seeking some vague goal that they all sense can no longer be found. </P> <P> The Indian wars are over, the buffalo gone, and the romance of the West withers even as the legends it spawned blossom.
