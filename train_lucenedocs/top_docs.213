One of three trapped whales disappeared under the ice and was presumed dead today, a biologist said only hours after rescuers scored their greatest success in moving the animals closer to open water. The whale named Bone was last seen late Friday afternoon, said Geoff Carroll, a North Slope Borough biologist helping lead the effort to rescue the three California gray whales. By midnight, Carroll and others on the ice near this small town on the Arctic Ocean had given up hope that Bone might rejoin the others.

But Harvey said he expected the whales to revert quickly to their natural behavior. Gray whales generally migrate within sight of land, usually no more than three miles offshore, Harvey said. Gary Hufford of the National Weather Service said that might present a problem, since the ice near shore was more solid than the ice farther out.

One of three trapped whales was presumed dead Saturday, but its companions inched toward open water as Eskimos cut a string of breathing holes and a helicopter battering ram smashed a path through thick ice. They certainly have a very good fighting chance in their battle to escape, David Withrow, a federal marine mammal biologist, said Saturday. However, a huge ridge formed by colliding ice masses stood in the way of a breakthrough for the California gray whales, members of an endangered species.

Favorable winds Thursday buoyed hopes for three whales trapped in Arctic ice as a huge military helicopter again headed out to slowly drag an icebreaking barge from Prudhoe Bay. While the whales still were 200 miles away from the open water of the Chukchi Sea, an easterly wind was breaking leads, or pathways, in the vast expanse of pack ice near the whales, said Gary Hufford of the National Weather Service. It was pushing the ice east and north, away from shore, and the forecast called for east winds and a slight warming trend until Tuesday.

Faced with thickening ice, plunging temperatures and the imminent departure of two Soviet icebreakers, rescuers late Thursday made a last ditch effort to free two whales threatened again by the arctic icepack. The California gray whales, freed from nearly three weeks confinement in their icebound breathing hole off Point Barrow, moved closer to open water via man made breathing holes and channels cut in the ice by the Soviet ships. But as night fell Thursday, the whales were in the last breathing hole cut for them, with about 300 meters of ice between the hole and open water, said rescue coordinator Ron Morris.

By nightfall, the workers were encountering dangerously unstable ice as a result of the icebreakers' earlier efforts. As they did Wednesday, the whales readily followed the path cut for them by the Eskimos.

Eskimo whalers wielding chain saws donated by an oil company cut new breathing holes for three beleaguered whales trapped two weeks in thick ice near the top of the world. The Eskimos on Tuesday cut three holes 75 yards apart in a line leading away from the larger of two small breathing pools the California gray whales have used since being stranded in the Beaufort Sea while migrating south. The rescuers, who received a telephone pep talk Tuesday from President Reagan, hope the new holes will influence the endangered mammals to move in the direction they must travel if they are ever to escape their icy corral.

Soviet icebreakers today neared two whales trapped in the high Arctic as rescuers prepared Operation Breakthrough, a go for broke attempt to smash through an ice wall blocking the animals' path to open seas. The vessels were reported about 20 miles northeast of Point Barrow before first light in Barrow, about noon EDT, said Coast Guard spokesman Ken Freeze in Alameda, Calif. A helicopter was being prepared to take representatives of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Coast guard to the ship, along with an interpreter, Freeze said. The Soviet news agency Tass, in a dispatch from Moscow, said the larger of the two icrebreakers, the Admiral Makarov, had been slowed by heavy ice and by fog which rduced visibility to less than 200 yards.

Officials decided against attaching radio transmitters to the whales, in part because many did not want to find out in case the mammals died soon after the $1 million rescue effort. They were battered and bleeding when freed and had to navigate 200 miles of ice clogged waters to get to open seas.

The whales are loose and in the channel and headed out, said Lt. Mike Haller, a spokesman for the Alaska National Guard. They looked good all afternoon.

Oil companies exploring in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas north of Alaska won exemption Wednesday from a federal law protecting whales and seals from even accidental harm. The ruling by the National Marine Fisheries Service allows each company involved in oil and gas drilling or seismic exploration to apply for letters of authorization allowing what is called a take of marine mammals incidental to exploration. The rule, published Wednesday in the Federal Register, will be in effect for five years, although the authorization letters will have to be renewed each year.

There was no comment from Sweeney; neither acquarium nor state officials knew where he was Thursday.

A bottlenose dolphin has become stranded in the chilly waters off Virginia Beach after failing to migrate south this fall, and authorities are planning a risky rescue to try to reunite it with its brethren. The dolphin, nicknamed Rascal, was spotted in early October in Broad Bay, and residents around the bay began requesting that the government do something to save it. On Monday, the National Marine Fisheries Service agreed that the animal's life was in jeopardy and that an attempt should be made to save it.

Humphrey the wandering whale, freed from one spot in the mudflats of San Francisco Bay, spent most of Tuesday stuck in another spot before he began wandering again. Five years after the 40 foot humpback's much publicized voyage through the bay to the Sacramento River, he drew a crowd of thousands to a cove near Candlestick Park, where he lay beached by rocks bearing a No Trespassing sign. A team of marine biologists, veterinarians and the Coast Guard nudged the 45 ton whale with their hands, splashed him with buckets of water, towed him with a harness and used an air compressor to suck mud from below him.

His legions of fans heralded him with songs, poems, books and, of course, a T shirt.

Monday, when three beluga whales were chasing two dolphins, the dolphins suddenly turned and began chasing the whales, Messinger said.

Animal rights activists asked a federal judge Monday to stop the New England Aquarium from trading a dolphin to the Navy, alleging the aqyarium has no legal permit to possess the mammal. Whether we get it (a stop to the trade) by agreement or whether we get it by injunction we don't care, said Steven Wise, a lawyer for the group Citizens to End Animal Suffering and Exploitation. Wise, who filed the suit in U.S. District Court in Boston, said an informal letter of agreement between the Navy and New England Aquarium would not be a legal transaction for the dolphin.

The team concluded that allegations had been put forward in such a way as to create an inaccurate picture, the report continued. Furthermore, the team concluded that, had the sole motivation underlying the allegations been concern for the health, welfare and care of the animals, the former trainer would have made better use than he did of the Navy's Animal Care Committee.

A Navy dolphin that died after being transported to the Persian Gulf did not succumb to poor training, mistreatment, mishandling or changes in water temperature. The dolphin died of bronchial pneumonia. There is no evidence that the nutritional program as it presently exists has adversely affected the health and welfare of the animals, and certainly no evidence of intentional starvation.

Divers and scientists failed again today to rescue a bottlenose dolphin that became stranded in the chilly waters off this coastal community after neglecting to migrate south for the winter. At one point the rescuers managed to snare the frisky dolphin in a net, but the mammal slipped away before he could be brought out of Broad Bay. The effort was then suspended until Jan. 4 to reassess strategy and get a stronger net, said Robert Helfant, captain of the emergency medical services dive team in Virginia Beach.

A bottlenose dolphin today eluded rescuers who tried four times to snare it and move it to warmer waters for the winter. By late morning, the rescuers suspended their efforts to try to decide what to do next. As many as nine boats and about 30 people were involved in the risky rescue attempt that began this morning about 8 a.m. on Broad Bay, but the animal swam away after each attempt.

Marine mammal rescuers tried to feed a young brydes whale Saturday but it was in critical condition a day after being rescued from a sandbar. A biologist at Sea World, where the 4,200 pound female whale was taken late Friday, said the whale might have become separated from its mother and then blown farther away by Tropical Storm Keith, which swept through the Gulf of Mexico early last week. Brydes whales are native to offshore tropical water.

The lawsuit said the federal permit Shedd received for importing the animals from Japan should be revoked until that country bans its fishermen from killing whales.

The $43 million construction cost is coming from a variety of sources, including state aid. The lawsuit said the federal permit Shedd received for importing the animals from Japan should be revoked until that country bans its fishermen from killing whales. The Japanese annually drive false killer whales to shore and slaughter them with harpoons or knives, sparing a few for sale to aquariums, said Sandy Goldberg, an attorney for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

Rescuers frustrated by a delayed icebreaking barge opted for a new plan to free three trapped whales: using a helicopter to drop a 4{ ton concrete slab that could punch a trail through foot thick ice today. A large, wide lead has opened four miles from the whales. That's the closest open water there's been yet, Ron Morris of the National Marine Fisheries Service said Thursday.

Time is running out for three California gray whales trapped in the thickening ice of the Arctic Ocean, and the discussion Saturday was turning from rescue to humane destruction. The young whales have been stranded for more than a week by new ice about 18 miles northeast of this Inupiat Eskimo community. The mammals are in shallow water only a few hundred feet offshore, where they have been rising to the surface every couple of minutes to breath through small and shrinking holes in the ice.

When SG Warburg sold off a quarter of its holding in Mercury Asset Management in 1986, it was trying to make a point. Not only did it want to reap some of the value of its fast growing fund management arm, it wished to underscore the independence of MAM. At a time when too many questions were being asked about dealings between the fund management and stock brokerage arms of merchant banks, independence seemed like a good message to send to the public.
