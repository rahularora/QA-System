Archaeologists unearthed a small marble statue buried in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D., the first such find in 13 years, newspapers reported Sunday. The statue, which depicts a baby boy riding a dolphin, was found Saturday in the House of the Casti Amanti, near the center of the abandoned city, Il Mattino of Naples and other papers reprted. Archaeologists said the statue was apparently to be used to decorate a fountain in the house, but that Vesuvius erupted before workers had a chance to set it in place.

Masked gunmen bound and gagged unarmed guards early Saturday at Herculaneum, a Roman city destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D., and stole hundreds of treasures, news reports said. Baldassare Conticello, the superintendent of the archaeological areas of Herculaneum and nearby Pompeii, said the inventory of the stolen goods was still incomplete, the Italian news agency AGI reported. The missing items included about 200 gold bracelets and earrings, a first century bronze vase in the form of a woman's head and a 32 inch silver and copper inlaid bronze statue of Bacchus, he said.

Its ruins, discovered in 1709, are considered better preserved than those at the more extensive complex at Pompeii, which was also destroyed by Mount Vesuvius' eruption.

An explosion that ripped through a fireworks factory on the side of the Vesuvius volcano killed two people, wounded three and produced panic in nearby towns, police said. Monday's explosion was heard up to a half mile away and the inhabitants of nearby hamlets thought the volcano was erupting, authorities said. Several firetrucks and a helicopter arrived from nearby Naples and doused the flames.

On that blazingly hot dawn in August, what sounded like a clap of thunder filled the air and the sky seemed to shake. Mount Vesuvius appeared to split open, and a hail of burning stones pelted down, followed by ash that filled the eyes, mouths and lungs of the terrified inhabitants. Within three hours, the small trading town was completely buried under hot ash.

Mudflows from Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz killed at least 22,000 people in 1985, while more than 2,000 perished in pyroclastic flows blasts of hot gas, rock and ash from Mexico's El Chichon in 1982, Tilling said.

MEASURING the temperature of molten steel manually is dangerous and costly, so Vesuvius International, part of Cookson, the international industrial materials group, has developed a new long life sensor which can measure the temperature of molten steel up to 1,8000C for more than 300 hours at a time. 'Steel companies throughout the world are trying to improve the quality of their steel,'said Wolfgang Loser, president of the German based Accumetrix division of Vesuvius. 'Our sensors will monitor the whole process, tell them second by second what the temperature is and guarantee they produce the best quality steel.

Italy's minister of culture says he won't approve construction of a four lane highway adjacent to Pompeii's famous ruins and across the ancient city's unexcavated necropolis. Carlo Vizzini, whose ministry protects and preserves archaeological sites, said Thursday that in no case will he approve a project that not only edges, but minimally touches excavations at Pompeii. Some members of Pompeii's city government proposed reducing traffic congestion in the modern city by linking two existing highways with a new one streching a little more than a mile along the famous tourist attraction.

ON THE morning of August 24 in 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius erupted. Pliny the Younger, living in nearby Misenum, left a harrowing account of the awful darkness that 'came rolling over the land after us like a torrent'. Hit by showers of volcanic debris, earthquakes and asphyxiating gases, Pompeii, together with Oplontis and Stabiae to the east, were submerged under pumice stone and ash.

THE VOLCANO LOVER by Susan Sontag Jonathan Cape Pounds 14.99, 419 pages FATHERS AND CROWS by William T. Vollmann Andre Deutsch Pounds 17.99, 990 pages THE PROMISE OF LIGHT by Paul Watkins Faber Pounds 14.99, 218 pages IN A time when so many novelists are raiding the history books for subject matter, you would have hoped that at least Susan Sontag, a writer unsurpassed at tackling the major cultural questions of our time, would use a foray into fiction to take an incisive look at the way we live now. No such luck. Her third novel, The Volcano Lover, is a rich, intelligent, historical romance that turns out to be little more than a prolonged meditation on dormant themes.

One artist grasped the importance of what was happening in England in the 18th century when he chose scientific demonstrations, iron forges and blacksmiths' shops for his peculiar subjects. Joseph Wright's first major show in London, opening today, comes almost 200 years after his death. He deserved one before but this often happens in England, said Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Gallery, at Tuesday's preview.

The city centre is usually easier and more enjoyable to negotiate on foot. Going by bus can be an uncertain experience: it is not always easy to buy a ticket before boarding, as passengers are meant to, but board anyway because no one will bother to check. The best of Naples hotels are on the corniche of Via Partenope, overlooking a small marina and the ancient hulk of the Castel Dell'Ovo, with the Bay and Capri in the distance.

A huge cloud of ash laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet above the volcano today, spreading ash over a six mile radius, the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said. ; If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining Clark Air Base, he said.
