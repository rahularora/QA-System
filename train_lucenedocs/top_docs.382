I urge the Arab states to refrain from mediation because they only want to take positions in the media. There are more of such states but they know that it would be futile to intervene because when guns speak, reason disappears.

I urge the states now initiating mediations to look for something else to do. We Yemenis are sensitive people. Above all, we say to those who want to exploit the current war by internationalizing the issue or by sending Arab forces, or anything else, we say frankly that, throughout history, Yemen has been the graveyard of invaders.

Above all, we say to those who want to exploit the current war by internationalizing the issue or by sending Arab forces, or anything else, we say frankly that, throughout history, Yemen has been the graveyard of invaders. That is why we reject intervention. What scares us about this talk of sending forces and of mediation is that they are talking about Egyptian mediation and dispatch of forces to disengage the warring parties.
 FBIS4-59088 
That is why we reject intervention. What scares us about this talk of sending forces and of mediation is that they are talking about Egyptian mediation and dispatch of forces to disengage the warring parties. That is a thing of the past.

What scares us about this talk of sending forces and of mediation is that they are talking about Egyptian mediation and dispatch of forces to disengage the warring parties. That is a thing of the past. The Egyptians raised it two weeks ago and a month ago but we rejected it because the presence of forces would mean partition and revival of the secession.
 FBIS4-59088 
That is a thing of the past. The Egyptians raised it two weeks ago and a month ago but we rejected it because the presence of forces would mean partition and revival of the secession. We tell them: Play another game, for that is out of the question as far as we are concerned.

The Egyptians raised it two weeks ago and a month ago but we rejected it because the presence of forces would mean partition and revival of the secession. We tell them: Play another game, for that is out of the question as far as we are concerned. [Al Ustuwani] So, in your view, what is the alternative solution?
 FBIS4-59088 
We tell them: Play another game, for that is out of the question as far as we are concerned. [Al Ustuwani] So, in your view, what is the alternative solution? [Al 'Ansi] They should leave us alone and let us act and solve our own problems by military or political means.
 FBIS4-59088 
[Al Ustuwani] So, in your view, what is the alternative solution? [Al 'Ansi] They should leave us alone and let us act and solve our own problems by military or political means. They would then have a clear conscience.
 FBIS4-59088 
[Al 'Ansi] They should leave us alone and let us act and solve our own problems by military or political means. They would then have a clear conscience. [Al Ustuwani] Do you believe that the solution lies in the disappearance of the current leaderships?

They would then have a clear conscience. [Al Ustuwani] Do you believe that the solution lies in the disappearance of the current leaderships? [Al 'Ansi] Why disappearance of the leaderships?

[Al Ustuwani] Do you believe that the solution lies in the disappearance of the current leaderships? [Al 'Ansi] Why disappearance of the leaderships? The solution hs been spelled out in the House of Representatives.
 FBIS4-59088 
[Al 'Ansi] Why disappearance of the leaderships? The solution hs been spelled out in the House of Representatives. It used the legitimate card and dismissed 'Ali Salim al Bid and Salim Salih Muhammad from their posts in the state as Presidential Council members.

The solution hs been spelled out in the House of Representatives. It used the legitimate card and dismissed 'Ali Salim al Bid and Salim Salih Muhammad from their posts in the state as Presidential Council members. That is a part of the solution.

It used the legitimate card and dismissed 'Ali Salim al Bid and Salim Salih Muhammad from their posts in the state as Presidential Council members. That is a part of the solution. As far as the north is concerned we have invoked constitutional legitimacy and the people's will.

That is a part of the solution. As far as the north is concerned we have invoked constitutional legitimacy and the people's will. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is there by popular demand.

'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is there by popular demand. When the people tell 'Ali Salim al Bid to go then he must go. But for him to impose a rule of fire and the sword on the people, exploit the crisis, and, against a background of mediation, sidestep the results we have achieved for our people, that is totally rejected.

They are (former southern President) 'Ali Nasir Muhammad and 'Abd al Qawi Makkawi. These are two patriotic figures with a formidable struggle record, respected by the Yemeni people.

[Al Ustuwani] So you are against the war decision? [Al 'Ansi] Nobody wants war. It was force majeure.

[Al 'Ansi] Nobody wants war. It was force majeure. Our war was limited and the military eruptions and escalations were on a limited scale, but when this war started three days ago our forces were hit in Abyan, the central security units in Aden were besieged and hit, and the power station in Dhummar was suddenly hit to disrupt the power supply to Sanaa, and the camps in Dhummar were hit.

If they want destruction for their country, then they should continue their aggression but we ask them to lay down their arms and to stop the war. [Al Ustuwani] What is the purpose of besieging Aden?

As speculations continued all day yesterday about the likely reaction of the southern command, observers said that the aim of Sanaa's initiative was to try to block international recognition of the new republic which the southerners, faced with President 'Ali Salih's intransigence, were forced to declare as a last resort to save whatever they can after the failure to reach understanding within the context of unity. AL SHARQ AL AWSAT has learned that Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council in the unified state and of the southern Presidential council; 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, former south Yemeni president; Shaykh Mujahid Abu Shawarib, deputy prime minister in the unified state; and Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah, all participated in drafting the initiative which was promptly accepted by President Salih.

Al 'Anasi said that 'Ali Salim al Bid, Yemeni vice president and secretary general of the YSP, and Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the YSP, said recently that they had uncovered a political Islam plan in Yemen against the democratic unionist plan which is untrue and has nothing to do with political reality in Yemen. He expressed his amazement at the YSP's use of this card to win the West over against political forces currently allied with it in power.

BFN <F P=106> [Unattributed report: 'Ali Nasir Denies Alignment With </F> 'Ali Salih and Considers His Supporters' Acceptance of Posts To Be a Personal Decision ] [Text] London, AL SHARQ AL AWSAT The former (south) Yemeni President ['Ali Nasir Muhammad] has denied any connection with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's recent decisions in Sanaa appointing a new defense minister and a new naval forces commander, both from the military commands which had seceded with 'Ali Nasir from the regime which ruled south Yemen before the unity, in the 13 January 1986 incidents. He said that 'Ali Nasir is for national unity and Yemeni unity. This came in an exclusive telephone statement to AL SHARQ AL AWSAT from his residence in Damascus, reacting to Yemeni and Arab claims that the appointment of Staff Brigadier General 'Abd Rabbuh Mansur as defense minister after Sanaa's dismissal of Defense Minister Staff Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir, who belongs to the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], and the appointment of Colonel Ahmad 'Abdallah al Hasani as naval forces commander, were made in the context of a new alliance between 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Nasir to strike at the YSP in the south by using southern elements.

BFN <F P=106> [By Mahir Chmaytilli] </F> [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 30 (AFP) Southern Yemeni forces have been hampered by internal dissension and a lack of manpower as they struggle to thwart a northern advance along about 100 kilometres (60 miles) of frontline around the port city of Aden. Three northern tanks slipped through into the undefended western suburb of Madinat al Sha'b on Saturday [25 June], the office of the south's appointed vice president 'Abd al Rahman al Jifri said. Initially they met no resistance, giving northern forces enough time to consolidate their forces and cut off Aden from its oil refinery 18 kilometres (11 miles) to the west along the coast road.

Signs of such a stand have come from the United Arab Emirates [UAE] in holding President Salih responsible for the continuation of the war. A number of Yemeni leaderships have meanwhile considered a number of options including secession.

He was emphatic that the Army brigades in what used to be known as Southern Yemen before the merger would soon shift from their defensive to an offensive posture, after the intensive bombing had failed to achieve its objectives. Contradicting 'Abd al Ghani's contention that the fighting was about to be settled in favor of the legal forces against the separatists in the YSP, al Bid told AL WASAT the military situation had not been decided in favor of the forces under the man (President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih) who made the insane decision to set off the explosion.

[Announcer] On the practical steps that should be taken in order to overcome the crisis in Yemen, Salim Salih Muhammad said: [Muhammad] At the Amman meeting held in this good land during the holy month of Ramadan, certain issues were defined in terms of beginning to implement the provisions of the accord document, starting with the security issue, which worries the Yemenis and really needs immediate implementation in order to bring things back to normal in Yemen. Afterward, we will get into the priorities according to a fixed timetable.

I haven't personally heard of any plans for intervention.

I haven't personally heard of any plans for intervention. [Sabra] Christopher has said that there are some countries that help the South and others that help the North and that weapons from neighboring countries are being amassed by the Southerners and the Northerners. What do these statements mean?
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] Christopher has said that there are some countries that help the South and others that help the North and that weapons from neighboring countries are being amassed by the Southerners and the Northerners. What do these statements mean? [Muhammad] I know nothing specific about this issue.
 FBIS4-45076 
What do these statements mean? [Muhammad] I know nothing specific about this issue. If the Americans have learned of this matter, then I don't have adequate information on the accumulation of weapons on both sides.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] I know nothing specific about this issue. If the Americans have learned of this matter, then I don't have adequate information on the accumulation of weapons on both sides. [Sabra] Pelletreau [U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs] arrived in Muscat in this period during which war is flaring in Yemen.

If the Americans have learned of this matter, then I don't have adequate information on the accumulation of weapons on both sides. [Sabra] Pelletreau [U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs] arrived in Muscat in this period during which war is flaring in Yemen. [Muhammad] I believe that his visit to Muscat came as a part of a tour of the region.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] Pelletreau [U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs] arrived in Muscat in this period during which war is flaring in Yemen. [Muhammad] I believe that his visit to Muscat came as a part of a tour of the region. He also visited Yemen, Muscat, the UAE [United Arab Emirates], Doha, and Bahrain.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] I believe that his visit to Muscat came as a part of a tour of the region. He also visited Yemen, Muscat, the UAE [United Arab Emirates], Doha, and Bahrain. [Sabra] Accidentally or what?
 FBIS4-45076 
He also visited Yemen, Muscat, the UAE [United Arab Emirates], Doha, and Bahrain. [Sabra] Accidentally or what? [Muhammad] I don't think that Pelletreau planned the tour to coincide with the battles in Yemen.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] Accidentally or what? [Muhammad] I don't think that Pelletreau planned the tour to coincide with the battles in Yemen. He happened to be in the region on the first day in which the battles erupted.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] I don't think that Pelletreau planned the tour to coincide with the battles in Yemen. He happened to be in the region on the first day in which the battles erupted. [Sabra] Do you think that the war broke out because the south wants to return to the pre 1990 condition and because the north wants to control both parts of Yemen?
 FBIS4-45076 
He happened to be in the region on the first day in which the battles erupted. [Sabra] Do you think that the war broke out because the south wants to return to the pre 1990 condition and because the north wants to control both parts of Yemen? [Muhammad] In fact, I am opposed to the names North and South.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] Do you think that the war broke out because the south wants to return to the pre 1990 condition and because the north wants to control both parts of Yemen? [Muhammad] In fact, I am opposed to the names North and South. [Sabra] Well then, let us call them the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] in the South and the GPC [General Peoples Congress] in the North.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] In fact, I am opposed to the names North and South. [Sabra] Well then, let us call them the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] in the South and the GPC [General Peoples Congress] in the North. [Muhammad] The problem isn't a problem of North and South.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] Well then, let us call them the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] in the South and the GPC [General Peoples Congress] in the North. [Muhammad] The problem isn't a problem of North and South. We are now a single people in Yemen.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] The problem isn't a problem of North and South. We are now a single people in Yemen. We can talk about the dispute between the YSP and the GPC.
 FBIS4-45076 
We are now a single people in Yemen. We can talk about the dispute between the YSP and the GPC. <H5> They All Use Excuses </H5> [Sabra] What does the YSP want of the war?
 FBIS4-45076 
We can talk about the dispute between the YSP and the GPC. <H5> They All Use Excuses </H5> [Sabra] What does the YSP want of the war? [Muhammad] They all use the Pledge and Accord Document as an excuse.
 FBIS4-45076 
<H5> They All Use Excuses </H5> [Sabra] What does the YSP want of the war? [Muhammad] They all use the Pledge and Accord Document as an excuse. They all emphasize the issue of implementing the Document.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] They all use the Pledge and Accord Document as an excuse. They all emphasize the issue of implementing the Document. The YSP puts the emphasis on implementing the Pledge and Accord Document.
 FBIS4-45076 
They all emphasize the issue of implementing the Document. The YSP puts the emphasis on implementing the Pledge and Accord Document. [Sabra] But what has happened is the opposite.
 FBIS4-45076 
The YSP puts the emphasis on implementing the Pledge and Accord Document. [Sabra] But what has happened is the opposite. [Muhammad] In one of my interviews with AL SHIRA', I said that the Pledge and Accord Document needs institutions to implement it.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] But what has happened is the opposite. [Muhammad] In one of my interviews with AL SHIRA', I said that the Pledge and Accord Document needs institutions to implement it. I said that if the institutions, such as the Presidential Council, the Cabinet, and the House of Representatives don't agree, the alternative will be anarchy, tension, and war.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] In one of my interviews with AL SHIRA', I said that the Pledge and Accord Document needs institutions to implement it. I said that if the institutions, such as the Presidential Council, the Cabinet, and the House of Representatives don't agree, the alternative will be anarchy, tension, and war. [Sabra] It seems that agreement has turned into a devouring act.
 FBIS4-45076 
I said that if the institutions, such as the Presidential Council, the Cabinet, and the House of Representatives don't agree, the alternative will be anarchy, tension, and war. [Sabra] It seems that agreement has turned into a devouring act. [Muhammad] What we are interested in is agreement, harmony, understanding, and dialogue.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] It seems that agreement has turned into a devouring act. [Muhammad] What we are interested in is agreement, harmony, understanding, and dialogue. [Sabra] Is there still a chance of understanding and dialogue?
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] What we are interested in is agreement, harmony, understanding, and dialogue. [Sabra] Is there still a chance of understanding and dialogue? [Muhammad] The door of dialogue is always open, and it can never be shut.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] Is there still a chance of understanding and dialogue? [Muhammad] The door of dialogue is always open, and it can never be shut. [Sabra] Even if 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih reaches the gates of Aden and occupies it?
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] The door of dialogue is always open, and it can never be shut. [Sabra] Even if 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih reaches the gates of Aden and occupies it? [Muhammad] The door of dialogue remains open.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] Even if 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih reaches the gates of Aden and occupies it? [Muhammad] The door of dialogue remains open. People fight and then engage in dialogue.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] The door of dialogue remains open. People fight and then engage in dialogue. [Sabra] When 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih occupies Aden, what dialogue will there be?
 FBIS4-45076 
People fight and then engage in dialogue. [Sabra] When 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih occupies Aden, what dialogue will there be? [Muhammad] I embrace the principle and I mean that the door of dialogue remains open.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] When 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih occupies Aden, what dialogue will there be? [Muhammad] I embrace the principle and I mean that the door of dialogue remains open. I am not talking of who will occupy what [Sabra] Dialogue is possible if there is equality between the two sides.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] I embrace the principle and I mean that the door of dialogue remains open. I am not talking of who will occupy what [Sabra] Dialogue is possible if there is equality between the two sides. But if the situation turns into a situation where there is a victor and a vanquished, then there will be capitulation, not dialogue.
 FBIS4-45076 
I am not talking of who will occupy what [Sabra] Dialogue is possible if there is equality between the two sides. But if the situation turns into a situation where there is a victor and a vanquished, then there will be capitulation, not dialogue. [Muhammad] One statement I have heard is that they haven't closed the door of dialogue with the YSP.
 FBIS4-45076 
But if the situation turns into a situation where there is a victor and a vanquished, then there will be capitulation, not dialogue. [Muhammad] One statement I have heard is that they haven't closed the door of dialogue with the YSP. In his latest statement, which I have heard through the media and on television, the House of Representatives speaker said that he will not close the door of dialogue with the YSP.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] One statement I have heard is that they haven't closed the door of dialogue with the YSP. In his latest statement, which I have heard through the media and on television, the House of Representatives speaker said that he will not close the door of dialogue with the YSP. [Sabra] But words change completely when one of the two parties is fighting at the gates of the other party's capital.
 FBIS4-45076 
In his latest statement, which I have heard through the media and on television, the House of Representatives speaker said that he will not close the door of dialogue with the YSP. [Sabra] But words change completely when one of the two parties is fighting at the gates of the other party's capital. In this instance, the language of dialogue is suspended and the language of bone crushing begins.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] But words change completely when one of the two parties is fighting at the gates of the other party's capital. In this instance, the language of dialogue is suspended and the language of bone crushing begins. So, is there a possibility of dialogue?
 FBIS4-45076 
In this instance, the language of dialogue is suspended and the language of bone crushing begins. So, is there a possibility of dialogue? [Muhammad] I still stress the principle of dialogue.
 FBIS4-45076 
So, is there a possibility of dialogue? [Muhammad] I still stress the principle of dialogue. There can be no solution without dialogue, even under the canopy of war.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] I still stress the principle of dialogue. There can be no solution without dialogue, even under the canopy of war. [Sabra] This is true.
 FBIS4-45076 
There can be no solution without dialogue, even under the canopy of war. [Sabra] This is true. But who will conduct the dialogue?
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] This is true. But who will conduct the dialogue? [Muhammad] Didn't you have war and conflicts in Lebanon and wasn't there dialogue afterwards?
 FBIS4-45076 
But who will conduct the dialogue? [Muhammad] Didn't you have war and conflicts in Lebanon and wasn't there dialogue afterwards? [Sabra] Yes, but Syria entered Lebanon and conducted dialogue among the parties concerned after separating the combatants and ending the war.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] Didn't you have war and conflicts in Lebanon and wasn't there dialogue afterwards? [Sabra] Yes, but Syria entered Lebanon and conducted dialogue among the parties concerned after separating the combatants and ending the war. Do you think that there is an Arab country that can lead the dialogue in Yemen?
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] Yes, but Syria entered Lebanon and conducted dialogue among the parties concerned after separating the combatants and ending the war. Do you think that there is an Arab country that can lead the dialogue in Yemen? [Muhammad] In Yemen, Arab countries and the Arab League can help the country overcome this crisis through dialogue, because intervention will not help resolve the crisis.
 FBIS4-45076 
Do you think that there is an Arab country that can lead the dialogue in Yemen? [Muhammad] In Yemen, Arab countries and the Arab League can help the country overcome this crisis through dialogue, because intervention will not help resolve the crisis. [Sabra] What is the mechanism for Arab intervention?
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] In Yemen, Arab countries and the Arab League can help the country overcome this crisis through dialogue, because intervention will not help resolve the crisis. [Sabra] What is the mechanism for Arab intervention? An Arab League delegation arrived in Yemen and stayed there for four days, but 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih didn't receive it.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] What is the mechanism for Arab intervention? An Arab League delegation arrived in Yemen and stayed there for four days, but 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih didn't receive it. Salih didn't answer Egyptian President Husni Mubarak for four full days.
 FBIS4-45076 
An Arab League delegation arrived in Yemen and stayed there for four days, but 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih didn't receive it. Salih didn't answer Egyptian President Husni Mubarak for four full days. [Muhammad] But he did receive the delegation recently.
 FBIS4-45076 
Salih didn't answer Egyptian President Husni Mubarak for four full days. [Muhammad] But he did receive the delegation recently. [Sabra] He received it on Husni Mubarak's insistence.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] But he did receive the delegation recently. [Sabra] He received it on Husni Mubarak's insistence. It took him four days to answer Mubarak's telephone call!
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] He received it on Husni Mubarak's insistence. It took him four days to answer Mubarak's telephone call! This means that he rejects any dialogue and any intervention by another party.
 FBIS4-45076 
It took him four days to answer Mubarak's telephone call! This means that he rejects any dialogue and any intervention by another party. In your opinion, can an Arab country, such as Egypt, Syria, or Saudi Arabia, conduct dialogue between the two sides after putting a halt to the war first?
 FBIS4-45076 
This means that he rejects any dialogue and any intervention by another party. In your opinion, can an Arab country, such as Egypt, Syria, or Saudi Arabia, conduct dialogue between the two sides after putting a halt to the war first? [Muhammad] Efforts by Egypt and Syria and, as I have already pointed out, by the countries which contributed initially, such as Amman [Jordan] and Oman, are needed.
 FBIS4-45076 
In your opinion, can an Arab country, such as Egypt, Syria, or Saudi Arabia, conduct dialogue between the two sides after putting a halt to the war first? [Muhammad] Efforts by Egypt and Syria and, as I have already pointed out, by the countries which contributed initially, such as Amman [Jordan] and Oman, are needed. [Sabra] How about the United States and France who have their observers?
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] Efforts by Egypt and Syria and, as I have already pointed out, by the countries which contributed initially, such as Amman [Jordan] and Oman, are needed. [Sabra] How about the United States and France who have their observers? [Muhammad] And the UAE and the Arab League as well.

 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] And the UAE and the Arab League as well. [Sabra] And what about Saudi Arabia? [Muhammad] I urged the brothers in the GCC at an early phase to cooperate and help Yemen contain the crisis, because Yemen and the Arab Peninsula are like one body.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] And what about Saudi Arabia? [Muhammad] I urged the brothers in the GCC at an early phase to cooperate and help Yemen contain the crisis, because Yemen and the Arab Peninsula are like one body. If a part of the body is ailing, the rest of the body rallies to help it.

[Muhammad] I urged the brothers in the GCC at an early phase to cooperate and help Yemen contain the crisis, because Yemen and the Arab Peninsula are like one body.

This is why I urge the brothers in the GCC to take any initiative to halt the war, to conduct dialogue, and to impose a peaceful solution. I have heard that they are eager to do so. <H5> Opposed to Arab Forces in Yemen </H5> [Sabra] You have constantly opposed the presence of an Arab army to separate the combatants because Yemen is a single country and, therefore, there is no need for an Arab army.
 FBIS4-45076 
I have heard that they are eager to do so. <H5> Opposed to Arab Forces in Yemen </H5> [Sabra] You have constantly opposed the presence of an Arab army to separate the combatants because Yemen is a single country and, therefore, there is no need for an Arab army. Do you still hold to your opinion?

<H5> Opposed to Arab Forces in Yemen </H5> [Sabra] You have constantly opposed the presence of an Arab army to separate the combatants because Yemen is a single country and, therefore, there is no need for an Arab army. Do you still hold to your opinion? [Muhammad] By God, I do.
 FBIS4-45076 
Do you still hold to your opinion? [Muhammad] By God, I do. President Mubarak has said: we cannot be a policeman to separate the combatants.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] By God, I do. President Mubarak has said: we cannot be a policeman to separate the combatants. The Egyptians have asserted that they are not for the intervention of forces to separate the combatants.

The efforts of the Arab League committee can help. [Sabra] When do you think the Arab countries will intervene? [Muhammad] I have learned that the Arab League delegation returning from Sanaa has asserted that the door of dialogue has been reopened.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] When do you think the Arab countries will intervene? [Muhammad] I have learned that the Arab League delegation returning from Sanaa has asserted that the door of dialogue has been reopened. [Sabra] But this delegation was a military delegation, headed by Major General Sa'id Bayraqdar, former commander of the Syrian forces in Lebanon.

[Muhammad] I have learned that the Arab League delegation returning from Sanaa has asserted that the door of dialogue has been reopened.

 FBIS4-45076 
What I mean is that this delegation has no political dimension. [Muhammad] I have learned from reliable sources that Yemen has emphasized its willingness to receive a delegation from the Arab League and from the Arab countries. [Sabra] Under the shadow of guns?

'Abd al Salam al 'Ansi has stated that in all battles, dialogue takes place on the peripheries. It is dialogue under the canopy of war and guns. [Muhammad] We went through this experience in the 1972 war, the 1979 war, and the 1981 war.
 FBIS4-45076 
It is dialogue under the canopy of war and guns. [Muhammad] We went through this experience in the 1972 war, the 1979 war, and the 1981 war. There were battles and there was dialogue [simultaneously].

 FBIS4-45076

Now, you are a single state in which one of the two sides excludes dialogue. It is the opinion of this side that the other side is a group of outlaws, not another state. [Muhammad] We were two states, and yet we engaged in dialogue.

 FBIS4-45076 
Now, there is a coalition government that includes all sides. [Sabra] Have you asked President Hafiz al Asad to intervene in the Yemen issue? [Muhammad] I haven't asked President al Asad to intervene because Syria took the initiative on its own.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] Have you asked President Hafiz al Asad to intervene in the Yemen issue? [Muhammad] I haven't asked President al Asad to intervene because Syria took the initiative on its own.

 FBIS4-45076 
Do you imagine that Syria would send an army to Yemen to separate the combatants? [Muhammad] This question should be addressed to the Syrians. [Sabra] Could you, as a [former] Yemeni official and a Yemeni conscience, ask Syria to send forces to separate the combatants?
 FBIS4-45076 
[Muhammad] This question should be addressed to the Syrians. [Sabra] Could you, as a [former] Yemeni official and a Yemeni conscience, ask Syria to send forces to separate the combatants? [Muhammad] I couldn't make such a request officially.

In the past, the brothers in Aden used to call my faction the clique. [Sabra] And you called them the band. [Muhammad] This is why I say they divided power, wealth, and the clique.
 FBIS4-45076 
[Sabra] And you called them the band. [Muhammad] This is why I say they divided power, wealth, and the clique. [Sabra] They ruined everything when they imitated al Qadhdhafi... [Muhammad] When some brothers, including 'Abd Rabbuh Mansur and Ahmad 'Abdallah al Husayni, who was appointed navy commander recently, joined the GPC, other brothers joined the YSP, including Amin Hasan Yahya, 'Abd al Ghani 'Abd al Qadir, and Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad, who are the latest to join the YSP.

[Sabra] Is this a Yemeni tactic? [Muhammad] I have nothing to do with the way in which the brothers have shared the clique. I left it up to the colleagues to make their own choice, letting each select the party it wishes to join because political action is subsidiary action.

 FBIS4-45076 
Will there continue to be a Yemen so there can be a center? [Muhammad] I am certain that Yemen will remain united, that the capital will be Sanaa, and that the center will be in Sanaa. But as to when the time to inaugurate the center will come, this is something that I will leave for the future.

[Muhammad] I don't believe that the fires will get close to the oil fields. The battles that have taken place so far haven't affected the wells or the companies operating there.
