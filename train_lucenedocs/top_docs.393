As many as several thousand Americans may suffer from a little known neurological disorder called alien hand syndrome, in which their left hands literally don't know what their right hands are doing, said neurologist Rachelle Doody of Baylor University in Houston. Doody discussed the syndrome Wednesday at a Boston meeting of the American Academy of Neurology. ; In the least severe forms of the syndrome, one of the patient's hands may flop about aimlessly.

A petition for habeas corpus is a civil action by a state or federal prisoner normally filed after the prisoner has been convicted and has had that conviction upheld on appeal. The habeas corpus petition goes beyond asserting that evidence didn't support a conviction and attacks the constitutionality of any number of police, lawyer or judicial practices that allegedly violated the defendant's rights. Conservatives on the court, in Congress and in the executive branch have complained for years that prisoners and their lawyers are dragging out death sentences by filing a succession of habeas corpus petitions that rehash old issues or raise new ones that could have been raised earlier.

Among the proposals by the Bush administration is one that would do what the court in effect has already donelimit the number of death penalty appeals. The controversy is over the centuries old system of federal habeas corpus, a civil lawsuit generally filed by a prison inmate who has been convicted and who has had his conviction upheld on appeal.

But state courts tend to give the petitions short shrift, especially second and third petitions after the first has been denied. The major delaying factor in death cases, accounting for more than 80% of the average time capital inmates spend on habeas corpus, is the federal writ.

The typical deadline in capital cases is a looming execution date, which usually sets off a new round of writs.

When screenwriter Barry Morrow first met Kim, his original model for the central character in Rain Man, Kim already knew Morrow's past and present phone numbers and the number of freeway exits to his house. They met in Texas where Kim and his father, Fran, were attending a 1984 meeting of the American Association of Retarded Citizens. Kim, 37, is an extremely rare prodigious savant, capable of recalling virtually anything his senses have ever told him.

Rather, it has sought to increase the authority of government over the private lives of individuals and to undermine historic protections against police abuse. ; Only a week before McCleskey II, in the case of Arizona vs. Fulminante, one of the court's most conservative justices, Byron R. White, made it clear that even he could not stomach some of the more extreme activism of the Rehnquist led majority.

The House is nearing approval of an anticrime bill that would expand the use of the death penalty, but it first must choose between two plans designed to shorten delays in carrying out executions. We who are the lawmakers believe that when the death penalty is meted out, it should be done fairly but it should be done expeditiously, Rep. Jack Buechner, R Mo., said Wednesday as debate got under way. Conservatives clamoring for tougher death penalty provisions were blamed by the chief sponsor, Rep. William Hughes, D N.J., for turning the bill into a political football a month before congressional elections.

A young man pleaded guilty to robbing an American tourist and in a fit of remorse asked that his 12 year jail sentence be increased, the government's news agency reported today. The agency said Judge Leonardo B. Canares of Cebu City, 350 miles south of Manila, immediately obliged Wesley Corpus' request and slapped one more year onto the jail term. The agency said the incident occurred Tuesday after Corpus pleaded guilty to robbery charges and told the judge he felt the original 12 year sentence was not enough.

There's no way to say how long those organs will be viable, Dr. Richard Sawyers testified over a telephone speaker in the Corpus Christi courtroom. She could have a heart attack or kidney failure.

The pronounced law and order turn of the court culminated yesterday with the justices' 6 3 ruling overturning a 1987 precedent and allowing use of information about victims' families in death penalty sentencing. The justices also ruled, 5 4, that the Constitution doesn't bar mandatory life imprisonment for a first drug offense. We are really seeing a solid conservative majority emerge in the criminal law area, almost across the board, says Alan Slobodin, a lawyer with the conservative Washington Legal Foundation.

Boarded up buildings and empty streets made much of Corpus Christi seem abandoned, but Ocean Drive was jammed with traffic jam Friday as residents and tourists flocked to the seawall after word that Gilbert would hit farther to the south than expected. Scores of cars cruised up and down the windy beachfront road, as bicyclists, joggers and windsurfers were joined by crowds of residents complaining of cabin fever in their boarded up homes.

MOTORISTS STOPPED in Texas on suspicion of drunk driving don't have a constitutional right to talk to a lawyer before taking a breathalyzer test, the state's highest criminal court ruled. Under Texas law, drivers who refuse the test can lose their licenses for as long as 90 days. Lawyers say that in recent years courts in other states have roughly split on the right to counsel issue, although historically most have denied the right.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday launched a broad set of proposals to combat crime, with measures to control gun sales, hire more policemen and limit appeals against the death penalty. Mr Clinton promised to introduce a crime bill into Congress next month offering Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 2.3bn) to put up to 50,000 more police officers on the beat, and called the proposals a 'major down payment' on his campaign promise to use the power of the White House to prevent and punish crime. The package would also bring tighter controls on gun sales, including a new drive to pass the Brady bill, which would require a five day waiting period before the purchase of a handgun.

'We must end the insanity of being able to buy or sell a handgun more easily than obtaining a driver's licence,' Mr Clinton said. The Brady bill, named after a former White House press secretary who was shot during an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, is now widely supported by police chiefs, although few of them believe it would do much to stem the availability of illegal weapons to criminals.

The Supreme Court today sidestepped deciding whether a criminal defendant's right to be tried by his peers is violated when prosecutors disqualify potential jurors based on their race. By a 7 2 vote, the justices ruled against Frank D. Teague, sentenced to 30 years in prison for the armed robbery of a Chicago supermarket and for the attempted murder of police officers shot after the robbery. Four justices one vote short of the majority needed to set binding legal precedent said Teague should not be allowed to raise the representative jury issue.

The ruling resolved a dispute over claims filed between 1973 and 1980 by workers who said they were disabled by lung disease resulting from prolonged exposure to coal dust, or by the families of workers who died after such exposure. These disability claims, to be paid by coal companies, are reviewed by the Labor Department. The legal issue was whether coal companies may avoid paying disability claims only by proving that miners were or are still capable of doing their mine work, or whether companies may present other evidence, such as medical problems that aren't mine related.

Robert Alton Harris was gassed to death in front of 49 witnesses at San Quentin prison after a series of reversals in which a federal appeals court four times stayed his execution, and was four times overruled by the Supreme Court in Washington. The Supreme Court overturned the fourth and final stay, which was issued after Harris had been strapped in the gas chamber, and ordered the lower courts not to file any more stays without the high court's permission.

Popular support for the death penalty as a punishment for murder has almost doubled since the mid 1960s, when it fell to about 40 per cent. Nine executions in 10 have taken place in the southern states.

The Bush administration last year tried to pass legislation making it easier to carry out a death sentence by weakening the habeas corpus protections which enable prisoners to delay execution with seemingly endless appeals.

The Democratic controlled Congress responded by proposing to extend the death penalty to 50 federal crimes a largely irrelevant gesture which covered such offences as the murder of a federal egg inspector.

The resulting stalemate has blocked any federal crime legislation, leaving states to press ahead with their own solutions.

Four Roman Catholic bishops held a cordial but noncommittal meeting with a delegation of former priests who were stripped of their duties because they married and who want to return to work. The hour long exchange came Saturday during a retreat for about 200 members of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. They listened and took notes, said Terry Dosh, one of five former priests at the meeting.

CORPUS hopes the church will reconsider the ban on married priests this fall at an international meeting of bishops in Rome.

That's a double standard, said Guy Murning, who was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in 1970 but left eight years later to get married.

Vacationers fled Gulf Coast beaches Thursday, property owners boarded up homes and businesses, and emergenc workers filled sandbags and readied shelters as powerful Hurricane Gilbert took aim at the southern tip of Texas. Tens of thousands of schoolchildren from Brownsville to Corpus Christi were given an unexpected holiday so families would have time to evacuate, and northbound highways were jammed Thursday afternoon. By 11 p.m., the center of Gilbert was about 275 miles southeast of Brownsville and a torrential rain was falling.
