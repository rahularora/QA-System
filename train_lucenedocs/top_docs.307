Before rushing to clap Hollywood on the back, we should also add that Green Card stars the great French actor Gerard Depardieu and was directed by Australia's Peter Weir, best known for Dead Poets Society and Witness (remember Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis cheek to cheeking to Sam Cooke's Wonderful World ). Depardieu's love interest is played with just the right air of mock indifference by Andie MacDowell, the more conventional sister of sex, lies &amp; videotape. ; Together, Depardieu, Weir and MacDowell have fashioned a slick, spunky little fable about a marriage of convenience that becomes something more, though not by the same predictable route taken by two decades of Neil Simon lovebirds.

Both films are told from the white point of view, though The Long Walk Home appears to offer more balance between the races. Taken on its artistic merits alone, The Long Walk Home is an earnest, often affecting, curiously anticlimactic film.

Both films are told from the white point of view, though The Long Walk Home appears to offer more balance between the races. Taken on its artistic merits alone, The Long Walk Home is an earnest, often affecting, curiously anticlimactic film. Its major assets are two fully realized performances by accomplished actresses, Sissy Spacek and Whoopi Goldberg.

I think we have some interesting choices this year, commented Barry Levinson, last year's winner for Rain Man, as he announced the nominees Tuesday. Reiner, Robinson and Weir were somewhat surprising choices, since several critics have overlooked their achievements in favor of such films as Paul Mazursky's Enemies, A Love Story, Edward Zwick's Glory, Bruce Beresford's Driving Miss Daisy and Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing. Said Robinson: Bruce Beresford deserved a nomination.

John Keating is the kind of teacher of which every student dreamed but rarely encountered. He tickles the ribs, he fires the mind, he preaches nonconformity. He even instructs his pupils to rip out the innocuous introduction from a book of poetry.

Over and over a bird sings 'Far away and long ago' at the start of Blond Eckbert. Like another woodbird in Wagner, she is introducing a tale of murder and incest from the romantic world of German folk stories, where huntsmen rove the forests and everybody fights through a dense undergrowth of Freudian subtext though there the similarities end. It is a coincidence that there are two new operas concerned with the power of myth in London at the moment.

A disabled Marine, an old woman's chauffeur, a cerebral palsy victim, an English teacher and a king of England these are the widely divergent characterizations nominated by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the best performance by an actor in 1989. Rarely has the Oscar race offered such a range of portrayals, making perilous any predictions of the winner on March 26. Daniel Day Lewis and Tom Cruise have been termed the favorites, but it's still anybody's guess.
