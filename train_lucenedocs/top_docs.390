Paul Driver reviews John Adams' new concerto conducted by Ken Nagano The London Symphony Orchestra's concert under Kent Nagano at Barbican Hall on Thursday was designed to be sizzling and balletic: Ravel's La Valse, Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet ballet suite and the European premiere of the Violin Concerto by the American John Adams (born 1947), a composer renowned for heady minimalist rhythmic intensities. Nagano is a leading exponent of Adams's work, having launched (and latterly recorded) his opera The Death of Klinghoffer and performed many of his other pieces. He is also a guaranteed sizzler in the concert hall.

To him it illustrates a melodic and harmonic flexibility and a contrapuntal richness alien to the minimalist rigour of his earlier work but called for by The Death of Klinghoffer and now the basis of what he calls a 'post Klinghoffer', or post minimalist, language. Actually, few minimalist composers besides the soporific Philip Glass have tended to keep matters truly minimalist for long; but there is no mistaking the opulent melodic and contrapuntal intentions of this new work, even if the part writing is heavily dependent on flurrying scale passages, and the rhapsodising does not quite throw up tunes.

Actually, few minimalist composers besides the soporific Philip Glass have tended to keep matters truly minimalist for long; but there is no mistaking the opulent melodic and contrapuntal intentions of this new work, even if the part writing is heavily dependent on flurrying scale passages, and the rhapsodising does not quite throw up tunes. The orchestra used is small (double winds), but a large assortment of percussion and a pair of synthesisers make up the odds.

There are the three movements, fast slow fast, traditional to a concerto: the second a gently musing and attractive Chaconne with the curious subtitle 'Body through which the dream flows'; the third an exceptionally lively Toccata with extra bite supplied by claves and cowbell.

According to a recent survey by the American Symphony Orchestra League, covering five years of programmes by the leading orchestras, John Adams (the composer of the operas Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer) is the living American composer most often played.

He wrote some good, exuberantly inventive works in his youth: Dream of the Morning Sky (1983), for soprano and orchestra; Love Scenes (1987), for soprano (Dawn Upshaw) and cello.

A specially commissioned poem serves as thematic backbone; it appears in both spoken and sung form throughout the work, usually embedded deep in the textures, while the hyperviola alternates keening chromaticism with ripe romantic harmonies. The mixture is beguiling and repellent by turns like latter day Skryabin; the sheer density of the sound world is seductive in itself.

The Cabrillo festival was begun 29 years ago by the dean of California composers, the wonderfully lyric and unpredictably multicultural Lou Harrison, as a quirky chamber music series in a coffee house hangout for Cabrillo College students in nearby Aptos. It grew quickly, moving to the college itself and later to a convivial circus tent on a thrilling site at the Santa Cruz campus of the University of California, overlooking the sparkling bay. In 1974, it hired an up and coming young conductor, Dennis Russell Davies, then music director of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra.

Sunday afternoon's Prom concert may have had a 'safe' programme, reasonable enough for the family slot in a Bank Holiday weekend, but it never sounded like mere routine. Conducting the BBC Welsh Symphony, Tadaki Otaka was freshly attentive to everything. The longest piece was Max Bruch's G minor violin concerto, which has been fading from the repertoire since the Second World War.

The longest piece was Max Bruch's G minor violin concerto, which has been fading from the repertoire since the Second World War. Raphael Oleg delivered it with searching affection, and complete command of its virtuoso writing in which he always found good musical sense; Otaka built up the orchestral music to a grand Brahmsian scale.

The central Adagio was both poignant and imposing, as it should be. A worthy performance of this concerto always makes one think that we ought to hear much more Bruch: it is a pity that not much more Bruch actually lives up to this elevated standard.

A worthy performance of this concerto always makes one think that we ought to hear much more Bruch: it is a pity that not much more Bruch actually lives up to this elevated standard. Even the choice of concert opener, Mendelssohn's familiar overture Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage, had an extra point here, for Elgar quotes it in the penultimate variation of his 'Enigma' set which ended the concert.

There was another, more languishing seascape after the interval, when Ann Murray sang Chausson's Poeme l'amour et de la mer+. She captured a sharp sense of loss beyond well bred feeling, almost persuading me that the darker mezzo voice usually assigned to the piece is not strictly necessary; meanwhile Otaka and particularly his cellos drew out Chausson's svelte lines with assured poise.

Finally, the 'Enigma' Variations got a properly idiomatic performance, emphasising both continuity and contrast: no sense of an old war horse being exercised, but rather of respectful, sympathetic rediscovery.

Finally, the 'Enigma' Variations got a properly idiomatic performance, emphasising both continuity and contrast: no sense of an old war horse being exercised, but rather of respectful, sympathetic rediscovery. Clearly, the BBC Welsh orchestra is prospering with Otaka.

In the hierarchy of the proms such honours do not come the way of many contemporary composers; that Adams was favoured is a measure of the insidious popularity of his works and the brouhaha that has surrounded his two operas, Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer.

The result is coarse grained there's nothing subtle about the scoring, and the big tune that caps the second movement is irredeemably banal. But in this case it is done with some panache and tongue firmly wedged into cheek; when Adams doesn't take himself too seriously his music seems all the better for it.

Kent Nagano, chief conductor designate of the Halle Orchestra, has been touring the country with his new orchestra. On Sunday they arrived home at the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, for a concert (broadcast on Radio 3) which was terrifically exhilarating not just in itself but for what it portends. It was an ambitious programme works by Messiaen and John Adams (composers with whose music the young American conductor has become closely associated) which had been given their British premieres earlier on the tour, plus a lightly glittering account of the complete Stravinsky Firebird score.

For Mr. Adams, who has built a career mostly in San Francisco and lately in St. Paul, this double welcome here looked in advance like a kind of coming out party. But in the end the man of the hour was not the Romantically inclined minimalist composer but the newly appointed head music critic of the New York Times, Edward Rothstein. Indeed, the most memorable moment of Adams week was the sight of a poker faced Mr. Rothstein striding from the front of Avery Fisher Hall up the center aisle, ignoring the cheers from Philharmonic supporters on both sides of him, as he rushed to his computer on 43rd Street to pour tepid water on their Masur fest.

At Fisher Hall, Mr. Masur, late of Leipzig and a long, apparently happy career as a conductor and communist, began his debut with some brief and light American works by Mr. Adams and Aaron Copland, matched in inequal symbolism by the weighty Seventh Symphony of Anton Bruckner, first performed in Leipzig in 1884 and dedicated to Mad Ludwig of Bavaria.

This is a true concert piece that any orchestra should be delighted to program: with its heart on the sleeve adagio movement and with the influence of Joe Venuti's jazz violin in the finale, it makes a statement, speaks for its time and captures its audience. It's not gigantic.

Misa Flamenca, by Paco Pena (Nimbus 5288; 41 minutes) Guitarist composer Pena has created a rousing and deeply felt version of the Mass in Spanish, using the flamenco idiom of singers, guitarists and percussion. The most remarkable facet of this new recording is the guttural flamenco singing, as in the powerful soul searching Our Father. Also of note: the Kyrie guitar solo by Pena, the insistent thumping of an anguished heart in Lamb of God and the catchy choral singing in the Santo.

ON WEDNESDAY in the London Festival Hall and the following evening in the Birmingham Symphony Hall, the San Francisco Symphony will be winding up its latest European tour: ten concerts in eight cities in 14 days. Nothing special in that: American orchestras regularly cross the Atlantic these days not just the Famous Five (Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia) but several other bands (such as Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and St Louis) risen to international prominence in recent decades, in equal part because of their own improved standards and increased 'visibility' via records. There is now a widely shared perception that, of all those formerly second rank orchestras, San Francisco's has achieved the most remarkable advances; and since this is most plausibly attributable to the seven year partnership forged with the conductor who is leading the European tour, the American born Swede Herbert Blomstedt, a special interest must attach to the latest British encounters with the orchestra.

It is a graphic and poetic representation of its story: Ulysses' return from his wanderings, and his ousting of Penelope's suitors.

Mr. Harbison's as yet unchoreographed ballet score Ulysses' Bow also has a distinctive profile. It is a graphic and poetic representation of its story: Ulysses' return from his wanderings, and his ousting of Penelope's suitors. Mr. Harbison works out his ideas efficiently in five brief scenes and four even briefer interludes, each with its own identifiable character.

The angular, Stravinskian depiction of Penelope's suitors as nasty, taunting children is wonderful, but not all the scenes work as well the more lyrical sections are limp.

By contrast with the others, Mr. Adams's Harmonielehre has an argument, a beginning, a middle and an end.

It is a deeply disturbing, probing piece, and also the most personal and expressive of the five. Indeed, all of the pieces except Harmonielehre occupy a kind of middle ground between a full throated tonality (as exemplified by the works of David Del Tredici) and the non tonal dissonance that contemporary composers feel they must embrace in order to be considered serious.

While there were few shining geniuses, he said, there were many who had experience, the virtues of the heart, and habits of business. On April 6 the Senate counted its first quorum. The first order of business: Counting the votes of the electors and dispatching messengers to inform Washington and John Adams that they had indeed been chosen president and vice president.

The postage stamp honoring the Senate will display the gilt shield and eagle suspended over the presiding officer's chair in the Capitol's Old Senate Chamber, in use from 1810 to 1859. The stamp honoring the House of Representatives features the fanciful Car of History, a winged marble chariot which, since 1819, has borne the carved figure of Clio, the muse of history, over the floor of the Old House Chamber, now Statuary Hall. Rep. John Quincy Adams, who served 17 years in the House after his single term as president, was inspired in 1840 to dedicate a poem to the muse who is shown recording in a book the events unfolding on the floor of the legislative body below.

The billing for Wednesday's concert by Music Projects/London was 'American Counterpoints', but this really applied only to Steve Reich's ingenious Vermont Counterpoint for one live flute and ten more on tape; and maybe, to Colin Matthews' Hidden Variables, which is in part a mischievous send up (British) of American minimalism and post minimalism. Still, what's in a name? In this case, the official but purely notional tie in with the American Art show at the Royal Academy.

The Spanish savings bank 'la Caixa', based in Barcelona, supports a diversity of concerts, including an early music festival now in its 16th year, and has just started a contemporary music festival. Looking at once to international celebrity and local talent, this inaugural venture featured the music of America's senior composer Elliott Carter (86 in December) and of the notable Barcelona born (in 1935) and based composer, Josep Soler. The first of the concerts I attended was given by the London Sinfonietta and its new chief conductor Markus Stenz in the Fundacio la Caixa's Centre Cultural.

These six, wonderfully crisp and witty movements were executed with panache. Rachmaninov's three Symphonic Dances Op. 45 of 1941 were brought off well enough but seemed all the more jadedly conservative with the concert's marvellous middle item, the Concerto for Piano and Strings (1979) by a living Russian, Alfred Schnittke, still echoing in the mind.

This often harshly dissonant work, Schnittke's third piano concerto, in this superbly thoughtful, elegantly shaped, powerful account, with soloist Dmitri Alexeev, came over as no more alienating than a darker piece by Sir Malcolm Arnold.

The music, like Arnold's, touches on jazz and the RPO's principal double bass, Jack McCormack, plucked out his cabaret tones with style. Though the concerto does, indeed, have its violent outbursts, they are only some of the strangely assorted collection of musical objects including a quiet Moonlight Sonata like triplet figure for piano, a near pastiche of the Russian Hymn from the 1812 overture, and a glissandoing string passage which Schnittke's apparently zany but actually ironclad argument shows to be all of a piece.

A sort of musical prophecy of the Armenian earthquake of 1988, the symphony deals wholly in monolithic and austere ritual gestures, minimalist in material whilst maximalist in rhetorical power.

In Thursday evening's Symphony Hall concert he conducted the first local performance of Toru Takemitsu's Star Isle. The mildly astringent Impressionism of his fellow countryman's evocative tone poem suited the orchestra's strengths admirably, calling forth burnished sonic implosions from the brasses and warm, muted tones from the strings.
