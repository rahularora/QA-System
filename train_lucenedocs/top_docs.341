A Senate vote to ban dumping sludge in the Atlantic Ocean brings the nation closer to the day when we'll stop using the ocean as a sewer, a key sponsor of the measure says. The Senate, spurred by fears about sludge and medical waste that has washed up recently on East Coast beaches, voted 97 0 on Tuesday to bar the practice. A similar bill is awaiting action in the House.

The measure, passed by voice vote, would set a Dec. 31, 1991, deadline for dumping in the Atlantic by nine authorities in New York and New Jersey. The bill would impose stiff fines aimed at making the dumping prohibitively expensive, and use penalty fees to pay for alternatives.

The staff of the Environmental Protection Agency recommended Friday that permits be issued to nine New York City area municipalities which dump treated sewage sludge in the Atlantic Ocean. An EPA hearing officer said authorities should be allowed to increase dumping sewage to five times their normal rates under bad weather, up to 15,500 gallons per minute. The report also recommends creating two barge tracks inside the dumping area, rather than the current single track, enabling more barges to use the dump site simultaneously.

Congress is expected to vote next week on compromise legislation to ban disposal of sewage sludge in the ocean by the nation's only remaining ocean dumpers. The new agreement, struck Friday by House and Senate conferees, sets a Dec. 31, 1991, deadline for dumping in the Atlantic by nine authorities in New York and New Jersey. The legislation imposes stiff fines aimed at making the dumping exorbitantly expensive, and pools the fines to pay for alternatives.

The House on Tuesday passed a much debated bill that bans the dumping of sewage sludge in the ocean after 1992. The measure, adopted by a 416 0 vote, sets a Dec. 31, 1992 deadline on sludge dumping by the nation's only remaining practitioners: nine sewage authorities located in New York and New Jersey. The compromise bill, climaxing a 10 year legislative effort, must now be reconciled with a differing version passed by the Senate in August.

The bill is aimed at closing the nation's last remaining sludge dumping site, some 106 miles off the New Jersey coast. The only agencies affected by the new legislation are three regional sewage authorities in New York, including New York City, and six authorities in northern New Jersey.

Why did you pledge a clean ocean to the people of New Jersey when your own state applied to pollute it? Speaking on Thursday in Norwalk, Conn., of what he called the natural heritage that we all have to do something about, Bush called himself a Teddy Roosevelt Republican on the environment.

The Navy has ordered ships in the Atlantic Ocean to stop dumping medical waste at sea, in response to complaints involving waste that washed ashore. Earlier this summer, beaches in New York and New Jersey were closed after a large quantity of waste washed ashore. The Navy was not blamed in the dumping.

The attorneys general of New York and New Jersey where beaches were littered by medical waste and other pollution last summer have presented an anti pollution plan they hope will become a blueprint for a national program. Cary Edwards of New Jersey and Robert Abrams of New York said Monday that the Bush administration will have to lead an aggressive attack if the nation's oceans and beaches are to be cleaned up. The president elect said he was going to do things differently than the present administration, said Abrams.

The Reagan administration says education and guidance should be sufficient to halt the waves of dirty needles and other infectious debris that have made East Coast beach closures routine this summer. Jeffrey D. Denit of the Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that the agency has no plans to impose regulations for medical waste disposal, despite a chorus of congressional criticism and public complaints. He told a House subcommittee that educational efforts will remain the administration's key to fighting the medical waste problem and federal regulations will be used only if those fail.

At midday today, Helene was centered near latitude 13.2 north, longitude 42.7 west, or about 1,125 miles east of Barbados and 2,500 miles east of Miami, about 100 miles closer than it was six hours earlier, according to a National Hurricane Center advisory issued just before noon. If it makes it all the way over to the west side of the Atlantic, there's a chance it could become much more significant, but it also has to go through a lot of wind patterns in the atmosphere that could mess it up, said Randy Lascody, a meteorologist at the center.

The report, which examined a variety of ocean pollutants, suggested the trend toward growing coastal contamination can be reversed over the next decade, but only through strict pollution control measures and curbs in development along coastal areas.

The Navy said Tuesday it was apparently responsible for medical debris that washed onto beaches remote from any metropolitan area, but that military officials did not know how it happened. The debris which is washing ashore ... in North Carolina appears to be connected with the United States Navy, said Chief Petty Officer Joseph Mowery, a spokesman for the Navy's Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk, Va. He said Navy officials had ordered a thorough cleanup and a full investigation.

A 66 million year old rock deposit in a Texas creek bed shows that the area was once smashed by a massive ocean wave, perhaps triggered by a large comet or asteroid that hit the Atlantic Ocean, according to a study published today in the journal Science. Thor A. Hansen, a geologist at Western Washington University, said he and another researcher found evidence that a wave, perhaps as tall as 300 feet, scoured the floor of a primitive Gulf of Mexico, picked up sand and shark teeth, then dumped the material in what now is in a bed of a tributary to the Brazos River in Central Texas. It (the wave) was so big, we think the circumstantial evidence is very strong that it was caused by a bolide (meteorite) impact, said Hansen.

Over many centuries, the sea water receded, dry land emerged and now the deposit left by the wave is seen in the wall of a creek bed in Falls County in Central Texas. The thing that is remarkable about this deposit is that it was produced far offshore on a quiet water shelf, said Hansen.

Based on the force required to move the material left in the deposit, Hansen said he calculated that the wave had to be 150 to 300 feet high. Circumstantial evidence, he said, leads to the theory that a meteorite striking the ocean caused the wave because there is no geologic evidence suggesting that a volcano or an earthquake could have triggered the wave.

BRITAIN is to approach the Commonwealth of Independent States for permission to send a research vessel to the Kara Sea, south of the Arctic Ocean, where radioactive waste was dumped by the former Soviet Union. An initial request, in 1989, to monitor radioactivity in the nearby Barents Sea was turned down by the Soviet authorities. Officials at the Ministry of Agriculture responsible for radiation monitoring around the UK coastline are drawing up details of the approach to the CIS.

A tropical depression in the Caribbean fizzled and was downgraded today to a tropical wave, while two other depressions brewed in the Atlantic as peak hurricane season approaches. We were expecting this one to have really picked up steam by now, but that just hasn't materialized, forecaster Bob Case said of the tropical wave about 300 miles south of Kingston, Jamaica. The system, which at its strongest had winds of nearly 30 mph, was still producing widespread showers and thunderstorms over the Caribbean.

Despite the fact that we possess sufficient scientific and technical potential to create the necessary conditions for processing liquid RAO into solid and for its subsequent disposal, we cannot take serious steps forward due to the shortage of finances. And a significant amount of these will be required.

An artificial reef made up of 23 concrete structures is being dropped into the Atlantic Ocean this week, and engineers predict it could be an answer to beach erosion. The $200,000 cost of the project will be borne by millionaire Willis du Pont, who will have four sections of the reef submerged off the coast of his Palm Beach property. The structure, designed by engineer Hans Rauch, has been tested by engineers at Florida Atlantic University and the University of Florida.

Afghan rebels said Wednesday they have not abandoned their fight for the besieged eastern city of Jalalabad, but are reorganizing for assaults on other communist held cities in Afghanistan. The Moslem guerrillas and Western diplomats reported fresh fighting in the war torn country, including the destruction by guerrillas of a northern ammunition dump laden with Soviet weapons. A seven party guerrilla alliance based in Pakistan issued a statement Wednesday describing reports they had given up the fight for Jalalabad as baseless.

On Tuesday, five members of the worldwide ecological group were arrested after they chained a dinghy to the rear of a sewage barge, with a protester chained to a mooring line for the dinghy, police said. That protest delayed the departure of the barge for three hours, authorities said.
