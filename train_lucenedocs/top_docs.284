Zookeepers and elephants are mourning the death of the San Diego Zoo's oldest and most popular elephant, a 10,000 pound matriarch that led the herd for 47 years and entertained millions of tourists. The 51 year old Asian elephant, named Lucki, was put to sleep Sunday because her health had deteriorated to where she could no longer stand, even with the help of a forklift, said spokesman Jeff Jouett. She was one of most popular and best loved animals at the zoo, said Jouett, who estimated that 102 million tourists had seen her over the years.

A 51 year old elephant at the San Diego Zoo had to be killed because of injuries she suffered after falling headfirst into a concrete moat, officials said. Maya, an Asian elephant who was the oldest mammal at the zoo, apparently suffered torn ligaments in her legs Sunday as she tried to climb out of the moat surrounding her enclosure, said zoo spokesman Jeff Jouett. Veterinarians resorted to a fatal dose of sedative when Maya was unable to stand on her own following a treatment of fluids, painkillers and steroids.

An Asian elephant who earlier underwent an unprecedented Caesarean section died during emergency surgery at the San Diego Wild Animal Park. A team of veterinarians worked on Jean, the 19 year old, 7,000 pound elephant, for about three hours Friday in hopes of alleviating complications caused by the death of the fetus in her womb. But in the end there was nothing they could do to save her, park spokesman Tom Hanscom said.

<P> Legislation that would ban elephant rides at zoos, circuses and carnivals is being prepared at the request of Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D San Jose), chairman of the Senate Natural Resources Committee, as part of a comprehensive bill dealing with the handling of captive elephants. </P> <P> The ban, believed to be the first in the country, will be considered March 9 at a meeting of a task force formed by McCorquodale after an elephant beating incident at the San Diego Wild Animal Park last year. </P> <P> McCorquodale also has asked the legislative counsel to draft language that would make it illegal to discipline an elephant by using electricity, depriving it of food, water or rest, or in any way that damages, scars or breaks its skin.

In Elephant Memories: Thirteen Years in the Life of an Elephant Family (Morrow, 336 pages, $22.95), Ms. Moss speaks to the general reader, with charm as well as scientific authority. In the end, her elegantly written and ingeniously structured account makes a powerful argument for the preservation of elephants from poachers who supply ivory to Japanese carvers and from legal marksmen hired to cull park herds and thereby save trees from being devoured. She was helped along by the African Wildlife Fund, the New York Zoological Society and various individuals.

In a brief call to arms at the end of this splendid addition to the literature of natural history, Ms. Moss permits herself a plea from the heart: In the last two years I have realized that more than anything else, more than scientific discoveries or acceptance, what I care about and what I will fight for is the conservation, for as long as possible, not of just a certain number of elephants, but of the whole way of life of elephants.

The elephants of Point Defiance Zoo are getting bigger homes at a $1.5 million cost, improvements necessitated largely by a profoundly problematic pachyderm named Cindy, the zoo director says. Cindy, a 24 year old from Asia, is returning after six years on loan to the San Diego Wild Animal Park. In fact, the San Diego zoo is pleading with Tacoma officials to hasten Cindy's return, said zoo director Tom Otten.

In fact, the San Diego zoo is pleading with Tacoma officials to hasten Cindy's return, said zoo director Tom Otten. It isn't so much that the four ton Cindy wouldn't mate with any of the bull elephants in San Diego, but three weeks ago she broke a handler's collarbone with a slap of her trunk.

Part of the plan is for construction this summer of a special yard for Cindy with an elephant crush, a hydraulic steel device to contain the animal while trainers trim toenails and tusks, administer medication and take blood and fluid samples. The San Diego zoo does not have such a device, so trainers must rely on each other to keep elephants still.

Elephants and poachers ignore orders, experts say, and trade in wildlife products is as hard to control as drug trafficking. Documents are easy to falsify. For example, Burundi lost its last elephant, an old bull, years ago, but officials there have managed to export up to 100 tons per year of ivory.
