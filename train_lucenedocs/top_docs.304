Rumbling spring thunderstorms have announced the beginning of the unofficial tornado season that runs from April through June across Texas and other Tornado Alley states in the nation's heartland. From 1951 through 1986, there have been an average of 118 tornadoes in Texas per year, according to the state climatologist's office in College Station. More than 60 percent of those occur between April and June, records show.

A tornado warning radar system had been disabled by lightning hours before killer twisters struck several towns in northern Illinois, a National Weather Service forecaster said today. But the forecaster said he didn't believe the system could have forecast the tornadoes that killed 27 people and injured more than 300 Tuesday across a region known as Tornado Alley, about 35 miles southwest of Chicago. The weather service's Chicago office issued a severe thunderstorm warning for the area, but did not alert residents to the tornadoes until six minutes after they had touched down in the communities of Plainfield and Crest Hill.

One of nature's most vicious spectacles, the tornado, is poised to renew its annual assault on America, as changeable spring weather breeds the storms that spawn twisters. Last year was one of fewer than normal tornado deaths, but even so, more than 700 of the violent funnel clouds struck the nation. In 1988 the nation recorded 32 tornado deaths, down from the 59 killed a year earlier and well below the long term average of 99 fatalities annually, the National Weather Service reported on Sunday.

In 1988 the nation recorded 32 tornado deaths, down from the 59 killed a year earlier and well below the long term average of 99 fatalities annually, the National Weather Service reported on Sunday. But while that's good news, it isn't an indication that the danger has lessened. There is no way of knowing what this tornado season will bring, but the way to survive is through preparedness, said Ed Ferguson, deputy director of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City.
