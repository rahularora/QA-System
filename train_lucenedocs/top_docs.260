MR ROSS PEROT, the Texas billionaire, is refusing comment on a report that he will pitch his political organisation, United We Stand, and his extensive resources behind opposition to a Uruguay Round agreement, Nancy Dunne writes from Washington. A spokesman for United We Stand said he has not yet taken a position on the Round, in order to focus his energies on defeating the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr Perot co wrote a book detailing criticism of Nafta after claiming, during the presidential debates, that 'a giant sucking sound' would draw American jobs over the US Mexican border.

A JUBILANT President Bill Clinton flew off to his Asian summit in Seattle yesterday on the wings of a famous victory in Congress and promising new initiatives to liberalise word trade. Approval on Wednesday night by the House of Representatives of the North American Free Trade Agreement was, he declared on the White House lawn, 'a long step in the right direction' of more open markets and more vigorous international competition. The Nafta vote gave the US 'the economic, political and moral standing' to make its case, he said, not only with the Asian leaders but also in the final push successfully to conclude a new Uruguay Round of global trading talks.

And the trade union movement, which has made Nafta into such an immediate life or death jobs issue that it has entered into unholy alliances with the populists of the right, has no record of entrenched opposition to global trading accords as a matter of first principle. Indeed, since President Kennedy secured passage in 1962 of his Trade Expansion Act, no global bill has faced a tough fight in Congress. This is essentially because congressmen, including those on the left of the Democratic Party, do not like being labelled protectionist.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton turned up the political heat yesterday on opponents of the North American Free Trade Agreement by accusing US organised labour of using 'roughshod, muscle bound' tactics to defeat the agreement in Congress. His attack on the labour movement, a traditional bastion of his own Democratic party, underlined the importance he is attaching to the Nafta vote in the House of Representatives on November 17. The vote is widely seen as crucial not just to ratification of the accord between the US, Canada and Mexico but also to US trade policy in general and to the success of the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations, due to be completed by December 15.

Bill Daley, drafted from his Chicago domain to direct the 'yes' campaign, disputes this estimate, counts about 195 in favour and says that some 55 Democrats are still undecided.

The anti Nafta Citizens' Trade Campaign is bringing 'Nafta Claus' to the Capitol to distribute gifts in a parody of the president's effort to sell Nafta to a reluctant Congress.

VOCIFEROUS opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement first surfaced three years ago when a coalition of US labour, environmentalists, consumer groups, farm and church organisations formed to oppose extension of the 'fast track' authorisation, under which Congress agrees to vote on trade pacts such as Nafta without amendment. These groups comprise the worker bees of the Democratic party, so it was with trepidation that the supporters of then Governor Bill Clinton watched their candidate endorse Nafta during the primary and general election campaigns last year. Mr Mickey Kantor, the campaign chairman and now US trade representative, said Mr Clinton immediately recognised that Nafta would not be 'politically viable' with either the electorate or the Congress later on without the side deals ultimately negotiated on labour, environment and unexpected import surges.

Sceptics in Europe and elsewhere note that the US has lately taken a harder line over the Gatt, withholding further tariff concessions, raising the stakes over financial services with east Asian countries and refusing to mollify the European Community over farm trade. They wonder whether Washington might, having secured Nafta, be tempted to spurn the multilateral negotiations in search of bilateral pacts with the Asian countries whose leaders Mr Clinton is to meet in Seattle on November 19.

FARM and manufacturing interests in the US midwest have grown weary of holding their fire against foes of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Like business groups and public officials across the country, they believe anti Nafta forces, particularly labour unions and Mr Ross Perot, last year's independent candidate for the presidency, need to be answered if the pact is to be implemented next January on schedule. In Illinois, the defence will be taken up by a coalition of 200 of the state's largest companies, representing agriculture, manufacturing, electronics, oil, steel and finance.

INTERNATIONAL trade, above all Nafta, is an issue which has never quite taken off in this year's long primary and presidential campaigns. Yesterday's signing of the agreement threatens to change that, for the moment at least. President George Bush will be able to proclaim Nafta as another example of his international statesmanship, conveniently obscuring the fact that his administration has been unable to bring to pass a successful conclusion of the broader Uruguay round of trade negotiations.

THE North American Free Trade Agreement, the most controversial US trade agreement since the second world war, has now entered the shadowy world of the Congressional fast track where legislative procedures are turned on their heads, a bill is not a bill, a conference not a conference, and legislation to implement trade agreements is born. The fast track procedure mandates an up or down vote on the 'implementing legislation', thus evading deal killing amendments designed to benefit special interests. Unlike a treaty, which requires a two thirds senate vote for passage, fast track gives the responsibility of approval to a majority in both houses.

Gains from a successful Uruguay round outcome would be even more marked, boosting exports by Dollars 6.5bn in year one, and more than Dollars 24bn by 2005. US imports would rise, but less markedly.

Gains from a successful Uruguay round outcome would be even more marked, boosting exports by Dollars 6.5bn in year one, and more than Dollars 24bn by 2005. US imports would rise, but less markedly. The forecasters see the agreements trimming inflationary pressures, slowing the rise in employment costs, and generating a 'small net increase' in jobs.

PUNDITS and pollsters alike declared Vice President Al Gore the clear winner in Tuesday night's televised debate with Mr Ross Perot about the North American Free Trade Agreement. Unlike an election debate, however, this confrontation could hope to influence fewer than a hundred members of Congress who remain uncommitted either for or against Nafta. The debate's impact on ordinary viewers a pool already diminished because the debate reached only homes with cable television will be felt only indirectly in the crucial vote in the House of Representatives next Wednesday.

MOVING with all deliberate speed and flashes of passion and anger, the US House of Representatives yesterday approached its climactic vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue emotion of a different sort barely suppressed elation was evident as the White House totted up the steady stream of new endorsements for Nafta and calculated, though it would not admit it publicly, that it would win. Mr Mickey Kantor, the Trade Representative, was among those convinced that the administration's application of maximum political force was on the edge of producing a great victory for President Bill Clinton.

This predicts the trade pact would provide a lift of up to 0.5 per cent of real GNP in Canada and the US, with a potential increase of 11.4 per cent in Mexico.

THE declining US trade surplus with Mexico has become a significant element of the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement, linking the US, Mexico and Canada. Last year the US manufacturing trade surplus to Mexico rose to Dollars 7.5bn, a feat President Bill Clinton and other Nafta proponents cite as proof that North American trade has already created thousands of jobs.

THE SIDE agreements it is proposed to attach to the North American Free Trade Agreement must raise wages and clean up the environment on both sides of the US Mexican border, President Bill Clinton said yesterday. Referring to the Nafta in language generally used by its opponents, he acknowledged that the pact was 'not simply a trade agreement, this is also an investment agreement'. Because it would make Mexico a 'much more attractive' investment, the Bush administration had negotiated rules protecting intellectual property and investment.

The earlier ruling would also have set a precedent which could have affected other US trade agreements, including the Uruguay Round.

'Whatever the administration sends to Capitol Hill with Nafta, or if they don't send a complete package in these three areas, the Congressional Democrats will seize upon the deficiency real or alleged, it doesn't matter,' said Mr Freeman. Governor Clinton is also likely to deem the pact the 'wrong kind of Nafta'.

Yet his main achievement since taking office has been to scrape together, after months of lobbying, the narrowest of congressional majorities for a distinctly unadventurous budget. Within a few months now the political horizon will be dominated by next year's congressional elections.
