The government says a weeklong military exercise in the Falkland Islands set to begin Monday is not intended to provoke Argentina, noting that fewer than 1,000 troops are to take part. Argentina, which claims the islands it calls Malvinas, lost a 74 day war with Britain for their possession in 1982 and still has not formally declared an end to hostilities in the South Atlantic. A communique Thursday from Argentina's Foreign Affairs and Defense Ministries said Argentina has adopted plans for vigilance and defensive alert during the British exercise and, if necessary, will execute corresponding defense plans.

Argentina's economic program is aimed at fostering economic growth, rapidly reducing inflation and maintaining an adequate level of international reserves. In fighting the country's periodic bouts of inflation, Argentine authorities have frozen public sector tariffs, salaries and pensions, which led to a sharp decline in inflation and interest rates in the second quarter, the IMF said. Argentina's economic program, supported by the standby credit, also seeks to improve tax administration, reduce staffing levels in the government, open up the economy to international trade and further privatize public enterprises.

The central bank said the six banks were closed Wednesday because of the serious deterioration of their solvency and liquidity and fraudulent administration. The closings were expected because the banks had been under investigations since as long ago as December 1984.

The resignation of Mr. Gonzalez, nicknamed Superman for his initial success in cutting inflation, underlines the continued instability of Argentina's politics and economy. Mr. Gonzalez, an ally of President Carlos Menem, was viewed abroad as a courageous minister. His resignation is a new setback for Mr. Menem at a time when the president is trying to contain damage caused by a short lived military rebellion last month, an unpopular amnesty granted to several of Argentina's former military rulers and accusations by the U.S. ambassador of government corruption.

Foreign Office Minister Tim Sainsbury said Friday that Argentina's new president appears to be seeking more normal relations, and Britain will respond positively. I hope we can look forward to a period of tangible achievement in our relations with Argentina; that's certainly our aim, Sainsbury told the House of Commons Friday before Parliament adjourned for the summer recess. Sainsbury, under questioning from a legislator, refused to say if Argentine President Carlos Menem has sought to reopen negotiations with Britain over the disputed Falkand Islands, off the coast of Argentina, and the restoration of diplomatic relations.

Brazil and Argentina are at loggerheads over Argentine complaints that it is a dumping ground for cheap Brazilian industrial products. But the two presidents might pause and contemplate how much has already been achieved in integrating their two economies in Latin America's largest free trade area.

Efforts to raise $1.95 billion of proposed international bank loans for Argentina probably will be slowed by Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp.'s recent massive additions to loan loss reserves, bankers and analysts said. The proposed new bank loans are part of a restructuring of Argentina's huge foreign debt negotiated last month. The agreement requires all of the country's creditor banks to contribute sums equal to 9% of their medium term and long term Argentine loans outstanding as of June 30, 1982.

Brazil's foreign ministry holds a privileged place in the country's capital, Brasilia overlooking the Congress building and opposite the Palace of Justice. The location is deserved because the ministry, known as Itamaraty, is one of the country's most able and important. But it is a cruel punishment for the diplomats, who are forced each day to look at the cause of their frustration politicians.

Brazil ordered its commercial banks not to repay foreign banks that seek to recall short term credits and deposits at the Brazilian institutions. The decision, communicated in a telex from the central bank, represents a hardening of Brazil's position. It came amid increasing signs in Brazil that the new debt moratorium initially dismissed by some bankers as no more than a tough bargaining stance is in fact a carefully prepared and committed attempt to change the terms for discussion of Latin America's huge debt.
