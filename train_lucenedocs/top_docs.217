In 1986, when they were to perform the piece at an annual Liszt Festival in Holland, the 58 page manuscript was seized by the Dutch government, which thought Liszt's notes were coded espionage secrets being passed from East Germany to the West. Now it's stopped by a storm, John Contiguglia said.

Habitat for Humanity announced Tuesday it will build 20 homes for Atlanta's working poor in a five day crash project starting June 27, the 12 year old volunteer agency's most ambitious project. The effort, named the Jimmy Carter Work Project '88 after Habitat's best known volunteer, is intended to fill a void between a market economy that does not reach down to some economic classes and a government with other spending priorities, said project director Bruce Gunter. Carter said Habitat arouses the conscience of the world to the problem of the homeless and to the disgrace in our own rich nation of the homeless situation.

Hurricane Hugo took a devastating human toll, but its victims also included rare and endangered birds such as the Red Cockaded Woodpecker, which lost one of its few remaining habitats in the killer storm. Some endangered species really took a heavy hit by Hugo, said Rudy Rosen, a biologist for the National Wildlife Federation, which along with several government agencies has been trying to catalog the loss. Perhaps no endangered bird fared as badly as the Red Cockaded Woodpecker, a tiny bird that conservationists have been trying to save from extinction for nearly two decades.

Mr David Dworkin, chief executive of Storehouse, must have his fingers crossed. A deal to sell Habitat to Ikea would suit Storehouse nicely even though the company does not particularly need the cash. Selling the British and French chains at anything like the mooted Pounds 50m would easily fund closure of Habitat in the US, which lost Pounds 8m last year.

Talks are also being held with Sears, the retail and mail order group, which is understood to be interested in buying Richards, the Storehouse women's wear business. City analysts estimate the two deals could raise up to Pounds 70m for Storehouse, though the negotiations have yet to resolve a number of 'issues of substance', according to one source.

The three quarter mile radius encompasses 1,100 acres. That's 1.2 million acres for all the known colonies, compared with 502,000 restricted acres under the previous rules, which set only a half mile zone, according to the American Forest Council in Washington.

Ikea is the privately owned furniture retailer, which, in four decades, has grown from a single store in Sweden's backwoods to become one of the most successful international retailers in the world. At the end of last year, Ikea ran more than 100 outlets in 25 countries, with annual sales of SKr22.3bn (Pounds 2.2bn). The company's vast blue and yellow retail sheds selling about 11,000 strangely named furniture products, such as Orgryte sofas and Smedvik dining tables, are a feature of the international retailing landscape.

STOREHOUSE, the retailing conglomerate created by Sir Terence Conran through mergers in the 1980s, was dismantled yesterday as the new management sold two of its five trading companies, Habitat and Richards, for Pounds 108m. The proceeds from the disposals to Ikea's holding company and Sears, respectively will be used to speed development of the core BhS and Mothercare chains, which accounted for about three quarters of last year's group sales of Pounds 1.2bn. Blazer, the small men's wear chain, has also been earmarked for disposal.

IN FOOTBALL parlance, it was a game of two halves at Storehouse last year. After a pretty dismal first six months in which it lost Pounds 13.9m, the retailing group, which includes BhS, Mothercare, Habitat, Richards and Blazer, recorded a strong improvement in the second half with trading profits for the period bouncing to Pounds 27.3m compared with Pounds 13.2m the year before. Over the same period sales grew from Pounds 572m to Pounds 606.4m.

ALMOST A YEAR to the day after retiring as chairman of Bloomingdale's, the up market North American department store chain, Mr Marvin Traub is to buy Conran's Habitat in the US, founded by one of the UK's fallen retail stars. Storehouse, the retail group which owns Conran's Habitat through The Conran Stores Inc, will receive a nominal price from MTLG, a vehicle owned partly by Mr Traub. The Traub consortium said yesterday that it would keep the Conran name, but planned to remerchandise the stores, possibly bringing in international designers and reinstating the catalogue operation.

The appointment of Habitat's finance director as divisional chairman and chief executive probably implies the imminent closure of the loss making US operation. The French stores have been alone in making a consistent success of the Habitat concept, so Storehouse would doubtless smile on any bid from its French management to take control of the rest of the division.

New management policies, including fewer controversial clear cuts, will be adopted to preserve more old growth trees in the national forests, the Forest Service said Thursday. George M. Leonard, associate chief of the service, said he guessed the new policies would preserve about half the nation's old growth stands more in some areas, less in others, depending on the tree species involved in and other things. Not all of the old growth is going to be preserved, he said.

But an appeals court in San Francisco overturned the delay in May. General Accounting Office investigators testified before a congressional hearing in late June that the squirrel's fate had become more precarious since the 1988 congressional act that authorized construction of the telescopes.

But an appeals court in San Francisco overturned the delay in May. General Accounting Office investigators testified before a congressional hearing in late June that the squirrel's fate had become more precarious since the 1988 congressional act that authorized construction of the telescopes. A springtime count indicated there were between 132 and 146 of the squirrels left on the mountain, their only habitat.

Habitat for Humanity's founder is keeping some people at arm's length while its leaders and backers struggle with allegations that he improperly hugged and touched five female workers. The allegations have sent founder Millard Fuller into near exile and put an uncharacteristic strain on Habitat, a strongly religious organization that uses sweat equity to build housing for the poor around the world. It has a $50 million budget and 100,000 U.S. volunteers, including former President Carter.

Evictions, maintenance complaints and other landlord tenant disputes are plaguing a low cost housing project for the formerly homeless that was called a miracle by former President Jimmy Carter. Carter helped put up the four townhouse complex in 1986 through his association with Habitat for Humanity, a non profit Christian organization based in Americus, Ga., that builds and rehabilitates houses for the homeless nationwide. Tenants, who help construct the buildings, are selected by a Habitat screening committee.

Thousands of people streamed into the Ford African Rain Forest after a ribbon cutting ceremony Saturday to strain for a look at Willie B., the zoo's biggest star, in the lush open air habitat which replaced the cage he occupied for 27 years. The 450 pound gorilla, now about 30 years old, immediately came to the edge of a restraining moat to strut for the crowd; once, he ran down a grassy slope, drawing applause.

Opposition groups say perching the telescopes on Emerald Peak, one of Mount Graham's three peaks, can only assure that the squirrels become a biological footnote.
