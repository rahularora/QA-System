<P> Set to battle over free agents Mark Langston and Robin Yount in what may become a Freeway Series of a different nature, the Dodgers and Angels begin the process today, when Fred Claire, the Dodgers executive vice president, meets with left handed pitcher Langston and his agent, Arn Tellem. </P> <P> The Angels, according to a source, have a Wednesday meeting with Langston and Tellem. </P> <P> Langston is believed to favor the Dodgers, Angels and San Diego Padres on the basis of location, but bidding is expected to stretch from coast to coast, and began Monday when the 90 players who filed for free agency were eligible to accept offers from clubs other than their own.

</P> <P> The biggest limb Langston ventured onto, at his welcoming party Friday at the Big A, was his description of the Angels as the team to beat in the American League West next season, even with the Oakland Athletics having been to back to back World Series. That one raised a couple of eyebrows. </P> <P> Langston explains that he and his off season next door neighbor, A's outfielder Dave Henderson, have been chatting over the back fence about Oakland's need to fill voids left by Storm Davis on the mound and Dave Parker in the batter's box and clubhouse, which in turn has led Langston to this startling conclusion: The Angels definitely figure to be the front runners going into the season.
