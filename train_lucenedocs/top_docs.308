Weicker, in a letter to Reagan nominating Ruth for the award, noted the athlete's off the field contributions. He had great compassion for the sick and dying, the senator said. Against the advice of many, Babe Ruth visited those afflicted with Hansen's Disease in Kalappapa, Hawaii, and offered those condemned to the leper' colony his love and kindness.

Against the advice of many, Babe Ruth visited those afflicted with Hansen's Disease in Kalappapa, Hawaii, and offered those condemned to the leper' colony his love and kindness. Well known for his visits to sick children, Ruth also established the Babe Ruth Foundation for underprivileged children shortly before his death and left it a large part of his estate.

Babe Ruth wasn't just a legendary home run hitter for the New York Yankees he's a registered federal trademark, his two daughters have charged in a suit against MacMillan Publishing. The suit filed Friday in U.S. District Court by Dorothy Ruth Pirone of Durham, Conn., and Julia Ruth Stevens of Conway, N.H., seeks to halt sales of a 1988 calendar published by MacMillan that carries a picture of the late slugger on its cover. MacMillan's unauthorized, unlicensed and unapproved use of Babe Ruth's image, likeness and name tends to cause confusion and deceive the public, said attorney Martin A. Levitin, representing the Ruth family, in court papers.

This is a story of great and small, and Mr. Kubek, with the help of sportswriter Pluto, makes sure to tell the small. It is the story of a team that came back after the heartbreaking loss of the World Series in seven games in 1960 to win 109 games in 1961, and to win the series that year in five. It is the story of Ralph Houk, who replaced the legendary Casey Stengel at the helm.

Mantle is quoted to inform any player who thinks he has it so bad Canseco, for example that among all the great hitters, no one had a more unfavorable home park than DiMaggio. ; And make no mistake: DiMaggio was a great hitter, and not just because of that 56 game hitting streak that has been celebrated since he strung it together in 1941. Consider that while hitting 361 home runs in his 13 seasons, DiMaggio struck out only 368 times.

Babe Ruth's daughters struck out in federal court when an appeals court ruled that a publisher did not infringe on their trademark by using pictures of the Bambino in a calendar. Three judges of the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals on Monday upheld a lower court ruling that dismissed a lawsuit by Julia Ruth Stevens and Dorothy Ruth Pirone, who has since died, and against Macmillan Inc. After Ruth's death, the sisters registered the words Babe Ruth as a trademark for playing cards and other uses. The court said the trademark did not apply to photographs of Ruth.

</P> <P> 5. Dennis Eckersley How would you like to be the best relief pitcher in the American League with a league leading 45 saves, an ERA of 2.35, a record of having only walked 11 batsmen all year and a record of having finished 53 of the 60 games you appeared and in the ninth inning of the first World Series game, you are breezing along with a 4 3 lead and have just retired the first two batters to face you, one by strikeout, the other by weak grounder. You need an out to, maybe, just clinch the whole World Series when up comes this batter who has hit just .196 all year with no great reputation for power (he has hit 2 home runs and has 17 runs batted in).

HarperCollins, 333 pp., $21.95; IN HIS introduction to I Had a Hammer, co author Lonnie Wheeler admits that other writers warned him about trying to do Aaron's life because the baseball superstar has never had much to say.
