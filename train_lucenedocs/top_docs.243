Two dozen students discovered that being a parent to an egg can really scramble your life. Third grade teacher Charla Easley gave her students at Ima Dell Fitzgerald Elementary School hard boiled eggs to name, clothe and nurture for one week as a firsthand lesson about the responsibilities of parenthood. The students were given $100 in play money with which they could pay to leave their eggs in day care at the back of the classroom if they wanted some free time.

EDITOR'S NOTE With so many experiments under way at the same time, it's difficult to pinpoint television's birthplace. Among the cities that lay claim to TV firsts is Schenectady, N.Y. There, 60 years ago, a handful of viewers witnessed the first broadcast to television sets installed in the home.

The flickering pink picture of a man playing a ukulele was a small miracle in an age of wonder, all but forgotten beyond the town once known as The City That Lights The World. The year was 1928, and Schenectady had grown from a sleepy hamlet on the Erie Canal to a booming factory town where the General Electric Co. had its headquarters and its finest research talent. For two years, Ernst Fredrik Werner Alexanderson, a consulting engineer for GE and the Radio Corporation of America, had been tinkering with a machine that used perforated spinning disks to transmit pictures.

My grandfather and great uncles played various instruments at local dances in North Dakota and in a small town band that was something straight out of 'The Music Man. ' Maybe this music gives us those people and those times back, when people were more of a community, dependent upon each other in real ways. You'll find strangers talking to each other at this dance and that sense of community.

EDITOR'S NOTE Do people love their pets enough to pay for their braces, a few root canals and crowns, or even just some dental checkups? A growing number of veterinarians are deciding that the answer is yes. Pet dentistry, though still in its infancy, has become a hot topic in the field of animal health care.

</P> <P> It figures then that two of the best instrumental acts in country during that time, New Grass Revival and Asleep at the Wheel, have existed only at the fringes of the country music community. But, if the two bands' clamorously received early show Monday at the Crazy Horse Steak House in Santa Ana was any indication, it's high time they came in from the cold. </P> <P> Since it was formed by frontman singer guitarist Ray Benson in the early '70s, Asleep at the Wheel has been rivaled only by Haggard in keeping alive the brand of music known as Western swing, a hybrid of country and jazz originated by Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys in the '30s.

Back in the 1950s, in Bugaloosa, La., a boy was born to Beauregard and Beulah Poindexter, the famous song and dance team; they named the child Buster. As the Poindexters toured the South, young Buster built up a large following, giving uncanny impersonations of Carmen Miranda and Louis Armstrong while drinking water out of a martini glass and telling jokes with the skill of a seasoned veteran. But on Easter Sunday in 1959, Beauregard was shot in a crooked game of hearts by a man in a Stetson hat named Staggerlee, the bullet shredding the queen of spades.
