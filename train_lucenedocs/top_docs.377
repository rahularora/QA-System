Galileo's optical camera made detailed pictures of the uppermost layer of Venus' sulfuric acid clouds, as did spacecraft that visited Venus previously.

The Galileo spacecraft, looping through the solar system on the way to its 1995 exploration of Jupiter, fired its thrusters today in a major maneuver meant to steer it near Earth late this year. We're trying to reshape the trajectory slightly so we move closer and closer to our aim point near Earth on Dec. 8, said Neal Ausman, mission director at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Galileo's tiny rocket thrusters, which are small enough to fit in the palm of a hand, started firing at 11:10 a.m. PDT and will fire roughly 3,000 times by the time the maneuver ends Saturday afternoon, laboratory spokesman Jim Wilson said.

NASA engineers were unwilling to wait until October to see the Galileo spacecraft's photographs of Venus, so they used an experimental method to get three of the pictures sent to Earth early. One of the photos released Wednesday shows clouds as small as 25 miles wide as well as clouds rising from lower in the atmosphere. It was taken Monday night when the Jupiter bound Galileo was about 1 million miles past Venus, the second planet from the sun.

NASA's Galileo spacecraft developed camera trouble today after zooming around cloud covered Venus in a celestial billiard shot that speeded the robot explorer toward its 1995 encounter with Jupiter. Although the glitch threatened to prevent Galileo from snapping five dozen more pictures of Venus tonight and next week, project scientist Torrence Johnson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said it should cause no permanent problems for the mission. Mission director Neal Ausman said the TV camera shutter, after taking 16 planned pictures of Venus early today, clicked open and closed 452 times, twice per minute, apparently because of faulty commands from the probe's main computer.

The far side of the moon, last photographed by Apollo astronauts two decades ago, was captured on film again by the Galileo spacecraft when it zoomed past the Earth on its long voyage to Jupiter. It's staggering to realize we've been neglecting our own satellite, said Torrence Johnson, Galileo's chief scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Astronauts with the 1969 1972 Apollo lunar missions photographed the back side of the moon, but Johnson said Thursday the last good pictures before Galileo were made by unmanned lunar orbiters during the 1960s.

NASA scientists said Sunday they plan to launch the Rolls Royce of spacecraft from a space shuttle Oct. 12, catapulting the ship Galileo to Jupiter so it can parachute a probe into the giant planet's atmosphere. During its looping voyage toward a December 1995 rendezvous with Jupiter, the spacecraft will fly by Venus, pass Earth twice, see parts of the moon not seen since the early 1960s and make the first close approach to an asteroid, the researchers said. The swings past Venus and Earth will catapult the spacecraft to higher speeds so that it can reach Jupiter with the least expenditure of fuel, the researchers said.

In the movie, the Earth will appear as a thin, distant crescent, then gradually fill the frame and expand until surface objects 10 feet across are visible. As the spacecraft pulls away from Earth's sunlit side, it will take a backward looking shot showing five days of the Earth's rotation, with the moon silently sweeping past as the Earth recedes.

The Galileo space ship cruised on the next leg of its 2.4 billion mile, six year trip to Jupiter after engineers replaced faulty computer commands that made the craft act like a mad shutterbug. Galileo snapped 16 planned photos of Venus on Saturday, but for about five hours the shutter on the spacecraft's electronic camera opened and closed 452 times when it wasn't supposed to do so. None of those unintended exposures were recorded.

The latest discoveries come from a far off realm, Uranus, relayed by Voyager 2, a marvelous machine launched along with Voyager 1 in 1977 to probe Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 was working so well after exploring Saturn that NASA reprogrammed it to sail past Uranus in 1986 and Neptune next August. Uranus is considered the oddball of the solar system because, unlike the other planets, it lies tipped on its side with its north and south poles alternately facing the sun.

Pioneer 10, the little spacecraft that won't quit, is still searching for a 10th planet five years after leaving the known solar system and 16 years after leaving the launch pad, NASA scientists said Monday. Disturbances in the orbits of Neptune and Uranus suggest that a mysterious Planet X may be orbiting beyond Pluto, John D. Anderson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said as NASA observed the fifth anniversary of Pioneer 10's dash past Pluto's orbit. Pioneer 10, launched in 1972 and now over 4 billion miles from home even though it was guaranteed for only 21 months, also is searching for long gravity waves proposed by Albert Einstein, and the boundary of the sun's influence.

Galileo had been scheduled to be launched from a space shuttle in May 1986 and powered out of orbit atop a Centaur booster for a three year trip to Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet and the fifth from the sun. Then Challenger blew up on Jan. 28, 1986, killing seven crew members and grounding the shuttle fleet until last fall. After the tragedy, NASA decided it was too dangerous to carry liquid fueled Centaurs aboard the shuttle.

After the tragedy, NASA decided it was too dangerous to carry liquid fueled Centaurs aboard the shuttle. Galileo's route to Jupiter was drastically redesigned and lengthened because Earth and Jupiter are no longer aligned as ideally as they were in 1986 and because the new booster is less powerful.

Galileo's route to Jupiter was drastically redesigned and lengthened because Earth and Jupiter are no longer aligned as ideally as they were in 1986 and because the new booster is less powerful. Because of the launch delay and the longer flight time, the probe was taken apart for refurbishing and to make sure some parts wouldn't fail because of aging, and its scientific instruments were retested.

NASA has started testing sensors aboard Galileo, five days after the spacecraft successfully fired its thrusters for a second course correction on its journey to Venus and Jupiter. We're testing all of the scientific instruments to ensure they are ready to observe Venus when Galileo whizzes past the cloud shrouded planet Feb. 9, said Jim Wilson, spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. On Friday, Galileo fired its thrusters during a 2{ hour period so that it will fly about 6,200 miles above the Venusian cloudtops, Wilson said.

More than 450 years after the church tried Galileo Galilei for heresy, Pope John Paul II came to the astronomer's hometown and pronounced the words many Pisans have longed to hear: Galileo was right and the church was wrong. The pope had previously said the Inquisition erred in condemning Galileo for teaching that the earth revolves around the sun. But his statements during a weekend trip to this Tuscan city were viewed by its citizens as Galileo's official rehabilitation.

A new shuttle experiment used a sensitive instrument in the cargo bay to measure sections of the Earth's ozone layer, an area of the upper atmosphere that protects our planet from most of the sun's ultraviolet radiation.

Ulysses, the first spacecraft to break free from the plane of our solar system, will reach the climax of a 3bn km voyage today when it flies above the south pole of the Sun. The Dollars 750m (Pounds 480m) Ulysses mission is a joint project of the US and European space agencies, dedicated to exploring the heliosphere. This region contains mainly ions (charged atoms) and electrons emanating from the Sun a bubble blown inside the extremely thin cold gas of interstellar space by the Sun's hot breath, the solar wind.

But their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because Voyager's Neptune encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a U.S. spacecraft. Future probes will orbit their target planets: Magellan at Venus, Galileo at Jupiter and the Mars Observer. And with no one planning a mission to Pluto, Neptune is the last unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from Earth in the foreseeable future.

The spacecraft swung into the Earth's gravitational field Saturday, hurtling 597 miles above the western Atlantic at the point of its closest approach. By sweeping near Earth, Galileo was able to use gravitational pull like a slingshot to increase its speed by 11,600 mph, boosting its velocity to 79,000 mph in relation to the sun.

A subsequent journey through the Earth's magnetic field gave scientists their first measurements of a solar storm in which magnetically charged ions take on higher energy levels. The data could reveal whether the majority of these ions, which trigger colorful auroras near Earth's magnetic poles, come from the sun or Earth, said Lou Frank, chairman of Galileo's magnetic field working group.

Some statistics known about Neptune as Voyager 2 nears the planet for its close examination tonight: DIAMETER: About 30,700 miles, nearly four time's Earth's diameter and the fourth largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, which is only a bit larger with a diameter of 31,760 miles. MOONS: Two majorones, Triton and Nereid, plus at least four others discovered so far by Voyager 2. Triton, four fifths the size of Earth's moon, is the only large moon in the solar system to orbit a planet backwards.

Three weeks after its launch from a shuttle, the Galileo spacecraft fired its thrusters Thursday to begin the first of about 30 course changes needed for its roundabout six year trip to Jupiter. We've started the first trajectory correction maneuver, mission director Neal Ausman said after the three day series of thruster ignitions got under way at 8:31 a.m. PST. During the maneuver, Galileo is firing four of its 12 thrusters in a series of pulses, he said.

After the tragedy, NASA decided it was too dangerous to carry liquid fueled Centaur rockets aboard the shuttle. Galileo's route to Jupiter was drastically redesigned and lengthened from three years to six because Earth and Jupiter are no longer aligned as ideally as they were in 1986 and because Galileo's new solid fueled booster is less powerful. The launch delay and longer flight time prompted a decision to take the probe apart for refurbishing and to make sure some parts wouldn't fail because of aging.

Atlantis outwaited fickle weather and streaked into orbit today, carrying five astronauts who will dispatch the Magellan probe to cloud shrouded Venus for the best look yet at Earth's nearest neighbor. The winged space shuttle thundered smoothly into the Florida sky at 2:47 p.m. EDT, after being delayed a nail biting 59 minutes by shifting rain clouds and winds that had threatened a second postponement in six days. NASA had 64 minutes in which to launch today and used all but five minutes of that time.

Magellan, ready for its 15 month flight to Venus, is 100 percent healthy and ticking along, said Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist. We're ready to go fly, said Richard Truly, who heads the shuttle program and is the incoming NASA administrator.

The mission costs $550 million, not including the $225 million cost of the four day shuttle flight. Magellan's radar images, relayed to Earth and enhanced by computer, should reveal details as small as 100 yards across, about the size of a football field.

Magellan's radar images, relayed to Earth and enhanced by computer, should reveal details as small as 100 yards across, about the size of a football field. That is 10 times sharper than previous pictures of the planet. Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist, said the radar images could help scientists understand how Venus was formed and might provide an answer to the puzzling question of how Earth and Venus evolved so differently even though they were almost identical when the solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago.
