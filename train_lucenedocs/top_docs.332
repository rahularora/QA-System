The Soviets hope to develop an atomic powered rocket engine to provide the propulsion for a manned mission to Mars early in the 21th century, a Russian scientist said Thursday. Vasiliy I. Moroz of the Soviet Space Research Institute said experts in his nation believe that a new type of rocket will have to be developed to make a planned 1{ year voyage to and from Mars. Moroz said Soviet engineers are working on an atomic electric rocket engine that would be used to accelerate a Mars explorer craft once it has been boosted into Earth orbit.

Astronaut Sally Ride, warning that the U.S. has relinquished its leadership in space in crucial areas, urged a detailed examination of the Earth from orbit and the human exploration of Mars early in the next century. Ms. Ride's long awaited report represents the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's latest effort to get the beleaguered U.S. space program back on track following last year's Challenger accident. The space shuttle catastrophe made NASA's shortcomings starkly apparent, said Ms. Ride, who will leave the space agency next month to take a post at a California think tank.

A Soviet space official says Moscow may push back the planned launch date of an unmanned mission to Mars to incorporate improved technology in both the spacecraft and the robotic rover that will retrieve samples of the red planet. Genrich A. Avanesov of the Space Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, told a space conference Tuesday that it may be in the Soviets' interest to put off the planned 1994 mission for about two years. Technically we do have the possibility to send a mission by 1994 with a Martian rover, but we're not sure it's worth doing, Avanesov said after a presentation to the conference on space automation and robotics.

If those conditions are met, the United States could send astronauts to Phobos in 2003 or to Mars in 2007 or establish by 2005 a lunar base from which astronauts could build a Mars outpost in 2015, said John Aaron, who headed the Office of Exploration during production of the report. Aaron said the agency has not developed reliable cost estimates for the missions studied in the report.

The shuttle Atlantis is set to soar into space Friday to rekindle an American planetary exploration program that has languished for a decade because of budget cuts and the Challenger accident. The cargo is the Magellan spacecraft which has a radar system powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of Venus and map its surface. The mission costs $550 million and the radar images could reveal much about the history of Venus and the evolution of our own Earth.

Scientists searching for life on Mars agreed Saturday that they must be patient and focus on learning more about the environment of the cold, dry planet. If we're going to find life on Mars, it's not going to be just sitting around in the dust someplace, said John D. Rummel, who directs life biology research for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. We're going to have to find places on Mars that are more likely to contain life forms than you would find at random, he said.

NASA may have to conduct extensive psychological testing, including some experiments that could last years, before it can select crews for deep space flights such as a voyage to Mars, an advisory panel said Wednesday. In a study of NASA's future needs for space exploration, the panel said the agency will have to conduct extensive test programs and develop new criteria for the selection of astronauts. The study, Exploring the Living Universe, outlines in broad terms the changes the National Aeronautics and Space Administration must make in order to be ready to staff a space station in Earth orbit for months at a time, or to develop the equipment and personnel for exploration beyond Earth orbit.

If NASA were a mental patient instead of an agency, you'd say it has schizophrenia, he says.

Officials worked around the clock Wednesday to restore contact with a space probe circling the Martian moon Phobos, but hopes were fading that they could save the $500 million project. A commission has been formed to determine the cause of the failure of Phobos II and present its conclusions in a week, said Sergei Zavgorodny, an official at Glavkosmos, the Soviet space agency. In an interview with the newspaper Izvestia, Glavkosmos head Alexander Dunayev said scientists were awaiting the commission's findings before taking further action.

It doesn't think like C 3PO or R2D2, but this robot can amble along the rocky surfaces of Mars or the moon as well as any Star Wars machine did in a galaxy far, far away. Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University unveiled the prototype Thursday. Nicknamed the Ambler by the team that has been working on it since October 1987, the aluminum robot stands 12 feet tall and has paired stacks of three legs that enable it to traverse uneven terrain.

A robot explorer named Voyager 2 flies past Neptune this week for its dazzling last picture show the final photo opportunity during the spacecraft's four planet, 4.4 billion mile odyssey. We're getting close, everything is working extremely well and we're all excited, said Norm Haynes, Voyager project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The surf is definitely up here at JPL, joked Franklin O'Donnell, a spokesman for the lab where about 170 scientists from around the world are asembling for the critical period.

If President Bush, in his Apollo anniversary speech on Thursday, hands NASA the job of sending Americans back to the moon and on to Mars, Congress will first have to provide the billions to rebuild a much weakened space agency. Today's NASA can't do it, said the agency's administrator, Richard Truly, last week. Since the heyday of Apollo, which put 12 Americans on the moon in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, NASA's work force has shrunk by 14,000 from 36,000.

But after the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger, NASA decided it was too risky to launch Galileo from the shuttle using a powerful liquid fueled rocket. A weaker booster was used, requiring Galileo to use the gravity of Venus and Earth to make a looping 2.4 billion mile, six year voyage.

President Bush today was weighing costs and timing as he neared a decision on a Space Council recommendation to set up a manned outpost on the moon and send astronauts to Mars, officials said. There's a lot of analysis that needs to be considered, especially in terms of cost to maintain a human outpost on the moon and a Mars mission, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters. It is a costly venture and those aspects need to be considered.

Mr Clinton and Mr Gore offer Nasa an opportunity, by seeking to swing the pendulum back to civilian pursuits and away from the Star Wars and military projects that dominated space programmes under Presidents Reagan and Bush. But they also want Nasa to spend more time and money on aeronautics research with practical dividends for civil aviation. Manned missions to explore the planets, they have warned, are a long way in the future.

NASA plans to land robot probes on a comet and on a moon of Saturn early next century in new programs that would cost $1.6 billion over the next seven years. In testimony prepared for a budget hearing before the House committee on science, space and technology, National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientist Lennard A. Fisk said Wednesday that the unmanned spacecraft would allow the United States to maintain world leadership in exploration of the solar system. Fisk, the associate NASA administrator for space science and applications, said a mission called Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby, or CRAF, would be launched in 1995 and would streak through space for five years before meeting in space with the comet Kopff and dropping a probe to its surface.

Twenty years after man's first step on the moon, President Bush said Thursday Americans must commit to the permanent settlement of space, first returning to the moon and then embarking on a journey into tomorrow, a manned mission to distant Mars. The president offered no firm timetable or pricetag for a program that could cost hundreds of billions of dollars but said it would be worth the cost because it is humanity's destiny to strive, to seek, to find. And because it is America's destiny to lead.
