Prince Philip of Britain, who has been criticized at home for attending Emperor Hirohito's funeral, today honored British soldiers who died in World War II by laying wreaths at a cemetery. Accompanied by Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe, Philip honored the 1,738 British, Australian and other war dead buried at the Yokohama Commonwealth War Cemetery a day after attending the elaborate funeral of Emperor Hirohito. In drizzling rain, the two British representatives laid wreaths at a crucifix in the center of the rolling cemetery grounds and later spoke with members of the local British community.

That pleases Leroy Ramsey, an Albany, N.Y., historian who six years ago began a lonely quest to correct what he feels is a great injustice. I'm kind of perturbed that it's taken so long but I am pleased that the Pentagon agreed to give it a full review, Ramsey said in an interview last week. A black World War II veteran himself, Ramsey was stunned to discover while researching a book that not one of the 1.5 million black Americans who served in the world wars received the nation's highest military decoration for bravery.

In a gesture of reconciliation more than four decades after the end of World War II, the Soviet Union has released the names of 1,500 German soldiers who died in its prisoner of war camps. The list was presented to the German Red Cross to coincide with the arrival Monday of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. It was the first time the Soviets had provided a list of German soldiers still unaccounted for after the war, West German officials said.

The remains of an Italian Unknown Soldier who died in the Soviet Union during World War II were formally given to Italian authorities at a military cemetery on Sunday. The remains symbolized the 90,000 Italians who died on the Russian front while fighting with the German army against the Soviets. The arrival of the urn at the military cemetery at Redipuglia in northern Italy marked the beginning of a program in which Italian remains from World War II are to be exhumed in the Soviet Union and sent home.

Britain's Prince Philip laid a wreath at a war cemetery Saturday in a move to honor memories and appease veterans angered that he paid last respects to Emperor Hirohito, Japan's World War II leader. Philip, accompanied by Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe, honored the 1,738 British, Australian and other war dead buried at the Yokohama Commonwealth War Cemetery a day after attending Hirohito's elaborate funeral. In light rain, the two British representatives laid wreaths at the center of the rolling cemetery grounds and later spoke with members of the local British community.

The modest U.S. Military Academy's Post Cemetery is probably the only burial ground that holds the graves of soldiers who fought in every war from the Revolution to Vietnam. There are soldiers buried here who were killed by arrows, musket balls, Viet Cong ambush and space capsule fires.

Not one Medal of Honor went to any of the 1.5 million blacks who fought in World Wars I and II, a fact historian Leroy Ramsey wants to change.

The casualty estimates by Western sources pale in comparison with the 20 million Soviets killed during World War II. But grief is no easier for survivors of Afghanistan victims, and veterans from both conflicts acknowledge the problem goes deeper than numbers. It's been 40 years since World War II, Sergei Kuznetsov told an American reporter at a recent meeting of Afghan vets in Moscow.

West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Tuesday he and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev failed to agree on whether to reunify Berlin, but signed accords to help the sick Soviet food industry and put a West German in space. The chancellor earlier highlighted his concern for human rights by meeting with Andrei D. Sakharov, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate at the West German ambassador's residence. Kohl, speaking to reporters before a second round of talks with Gorbachev, took a philosophical view to the dispute over Berlin that surfaced in banquet speeches the night before.

David Rubitsky, 72, a retired merchant seaman who lives in Wisconsin, and his supporters say that the veteran, armed only with a machine gun, a carbine and an automatic rifle, cut down 500 to 600 enemy troops in New Guinea in December, 1942. The New York Times said that two of Rubitsky's superiors recommended him for the Medal of Honor but a third rejected the idea because Rubitsky is Jewish.

Americans watched with some fascination as the U.S. led United Nations troops were almost overrun, then counterattacked all the way to North Korea, then were beaten back by hordes of Chinese troops.

Gavin worked his way to the upper echelon of Army command during a 34 year career that began in 1925 when he enlisted as a private at age 17. He had dropped out of school after the eighth grade, but completed his high school education as an Army private, gained admission to West Point and was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1929. By the time he resigned at 51 in a dispute over the Army's role in missile development, he was the youngest three star general.

EL ALAMEIN, Egypt (AP) This dusty coastal village of Bedouin houses, car repair shops, a rest house and two gas stations has little to offer for the living except memories of the dead. On Sunday, 2,000 people are expected here to mourn those who fell in World War II in the Battle of el Alamein. Since 1978, the Service of Remembrance for the more than 70,000 casualties of the battle has been held on the Sunday nearest to Oct. 23.

The peacetime Army is a healthy alternative to civilian life, say military researchers who found that soldiers in 1986 died at half the rate of their civilian counterparts. But one professor says choosing a year of peace for such a study may obscure the realities of serving a nation that goes to war about once a decade. Army researchers compared death rates among all 781,000 soldiers to civilian counterparts of the same age, race and sex in 1986.

For the millions of people who were born after World War II, the solemn ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the German invasion of this nation amounted to a history lesson. For the Poles who lived through the carnage, the memorials marking the Sept. 1, 1939, outbreak of the war have brought back a flood of memories. I survived, said Alexandra Sikorska, who served as a courier for the Polish resistance.

In a war few outside Poland recall, soldiers of the newborn Polish republic 70 years ago this week retaliated in a battle that saved Warsaw from Bolshevik conquest and the wrath of the Red Army. Until last year, the Polish Soviet war of 1919 20 was rarely discussed by Poland's former Communist authorities because they correctly gauged local sensitivities about the Miracle of the Vistula. But five days of observances about the battle that began Aug. 13, 1920, were organized in villages across Poland for the first anniversary observance since the end of Communist rule.

With central Europe in collapse after World War I and the German working class excited by Bolshevism's triumph in Russia, Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin dreamed of conquering Poland, which would put the Red Army in mid Europe and spread the socialist revolution across Europe.

Evelley's granddaughter, Judy Galgay of Naples, asked the professor to investigate. This was always told to us as children growing up that the man at the base of the flag was our Uncle Henry, she said Friday. Albee said he combed through papers of the Hansen and Evelley families and other manuscripts and concluded the Marine Corps investigation was neither fair nor thorough.

EL ALAMEIN, Egypt (AP) They were young soldiers, far from home, huddled in desert sands, waiting for the nighttime sky to explode. The last time some of them would ever look at their watches was 9:39 p.m., Oct. 23, 1942. In one minute the wails of bagpipes would summon the guns of Bernard Law Montgomery's 8th Army, the Desert Rats, and the final battle at El Alamein would begin.

Regardless of which war it was or how many years have passed, the grunts the infantrymen who've fought in a war don't readily talk about it with those who've never been in one. A common reason: only other grunts can possibly understand what combat is like. It takes an uncommon interviewer to draw these men out, yet avoid a succession of war stories that become routine through repetition.
