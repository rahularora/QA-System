The miniseries comes to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood next week, and the show's cardigan clad creator promises a message as gentle and reassuring as ever. The three part musical, titled Josephine the Short Neck Giraffe, tells the story of a young giraffe who yearns for a long, graceful neck like all the other giraffes. She eventually grows, Fred Rogers confided, not on the outside, but on the important side.

You're much more than a neck, Josephine. And you're much more than a trunk, Hazel. A chicken's more than a peck, and there's more than a smell to a skunk, Rogers quietly sang during an interview at Pittsburgh's WQED TV, home to his children's programs for the past 35 years.

Replacing animals was too expensive for municipal administrations that suffered inflation, recession and near bankruptcy in recent years. An elephant can cost $70,000 and a rhino $150,000. When it opened 102 years ago, the Buenos Aires zoo was an oasis of shady paths and exotic animals in the noise and pollution of a city that would grow to a population of 10 million.

Some buildings are boarded up and there are few attendants to remind visitors not to feed the animals, try to catch them or poke them with sticks. Last month, the city leased the zoo to Gerardo Sofovich, a television host and animal lover, who said he would invest $5 million to buy new animals and spruce the place up.

The winner of a drawing sponsored by a snack food maker, Mrs. Goins, 57, will receive $10,000 for each of five free throw attempts she makes during halftime at Game 4 of the Lakers Pistons NBA Championship playoff game Tuesday night. Even if Mrs. Goins misses all five free throws, she will still take home $10,000.

There are 450 animals from more than 100 species. Unlike the old zoo, the new zoo has no large animals because of space. This is a mini zoo, to show things likely to arouse people's interest and a sense of caring, said Dr. William G. Conway, general director of the New York Zoological Society, which runs the zoo for the city Parks Department.

LONDON ZOO, the world's oldest zoo and one of the capital's leading tourist attractions, is to close in September unless a private backer can be found. The zoo, which occupies 36 acres in the north part of Regent's Park, has been in financial difficulties for some time. Attendances so far this year have been up to 30 per cent below last year and the zoo has a deficit of Pounds 2m on annual running costs.

In its annual report on U.S. trade barriers, the European Community Commission expressed alarm about what it called a growing trend toward protectionist or biased legislation by U.S. states. It also signaled EC fears about U.S. congressional calls for limits on foreign investment and criticized laws that cover activities outside the country. While U.S. protectionism hasn't increased in the past year, EC officials said many points in the report stemmed from the failure to conclude the Uruguay Round of talks within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

There was a time when the Atlanta zoo was regarded as a kind of animal concentration camp, a place where one keeper ate rabbits from the petting zoo and where other beasts lived and died unnaturally. But that was before zoo director Terry Maple came along with his imagination and enthusiasm and organizational skills. Six years later and halfway through a $50 million renovation, the Atlanta zoo is a respected model in the zoological world, and Terry Maple is a very tired man.

Finally, some of the animals in London Zoo are unusual. When I visited, Chia Chia the giant panda was in Mexico City, where it was hoped he could be persuaded to father a new entry in the international giant panda stud book, which is overseen by London Zoo's Jo Gipps. He also looks after the breeding records of the golden lion tamarin (a small South American squirrel monkey) and those of Sumatran tigers.

His two pairs of young Asian lions are particularly important, in view of the recent discovery that the captive population of Asian lions in the U.S. is made up not of purebreds, but of animals that have at some point acquired an admixture of African lion bloodlines.

Not counting insects, there are 8,000 animals at the mother of zoos (it opened in 1826) that will have to be rehoused or disposed of if it closes, as is now threatened, in September 1992.

Soon after his attorney filed an appeal on that conviction, Muldoon was indicted on charges of trafficking in secret defense information.

Thomas E. Muldoon, a former consultant to Norden Systems, already had been convicted on eight felonies, including conspiracy and bribery of a public official. Soon after his attorney filed an appeal on that conviction, Muldoon was indicted on charges of trafficking in secret defense information. U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. in Alexandria, Va., wrote Friday that there was a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness on the part of the United States in causing the return of the present indictment in retaliation for the defendant Thomas E. Muldoon's going to trial or noting an appeal for his prior conviction or both.

Soon after his attorney filed an appeal on that conviction, Muldoon was indicted on charges of trafficking in secret defense information. U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. in Alexandria, Va., wrote Friday that there was a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness on the part of the United States in causing the return of the present indictment in retaliation for the defendant Thomas E. Muldoon's going to trial or noting an appeal for his prior conviction or both. Muldoon, 60, was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined $10,000 for his conviction arising from the investigation of fraud in defense procurement, code named Ill Wind.

The arts should not be subject to censorship or bureaucratic restrictions on government funding, Soviet born symphony director Mstislav Rostropovich told Congress. Rostropovich, artistic director of the National Symphony Orchestra, told a Senate hearing Friday on financing for the National Endowment for the Arts that it was Soviet censorship that drove him to the United States. He argued for reauthorization of the NEA, without restrictions intended to prevent federal aid for obscene art.

SIX WHITE, black and tan wild dogs, the rarest and most endangered of Africa's carnivores, reluctantly rose to their feet and disdainfully stepped aside as we pushed into the thick thorn scrub where they were resting in the heat of the day. For the first time in my life I felt quite invisible, my universally feared human form subsumed into that of the African elephant on which I was riding, for the dogs had no inkling of our presence. All they noticed were the great grey ghosts padding almost silently past.
