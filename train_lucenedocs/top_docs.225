We read how a civil and amused Achilles presides over Greek funeral athletics in Patroclus's honor. We read with even more amazement of the meeting between Achilles and Priam, the father of the murdered Hector, who begs him to return his son's corpse: I have endured what no one on earth has ever done before /I put to my lips the hands of the man who killed my son. Gently, Achilles consents.

Basil; in Spain, gifts are given on Epiphany, Jan. 6, by the Three Wise Men. The roots of the down the chimney story, popular in northern Europe and the U.S., may lie in one of the many tales told of the original St. Nicholas of Myra: One day three maidens of Myra went to the bishop, saying that unless they could find dowries enabling them to marry, they would be sold into prostitution. The bishop, who came from a wealthy family, raised the money, and in the middle of the night threw a sack of gold through the open window of each one's house, to be found the next morning, thus saving the girls.

Greece's shipowners have already had to accept tough new safety regulations for tankers as the price of keeping access to the US oil transport market. They are now worried that the UK or even the European Union may adopt equally stringent measures to prevent disastrous oil spills. Greek owners control 15 per cent of the world's oil tanker tonnage, including a high proportion of very large and ultra large crude carriers (VLCCs and ULCCs).

AN ANCIENT whodunnit has a special fascination, particularly when the gentle scraping of an archaeologist's trowel unexpectedly reveals the murder victim. Nikos Stampolidis has been excavating an early Greek cemetery at Eleutherna, in the western foothills of Mount Ida on the island of Crete: 'a site full of surprises,' as he puts it. Not the least of these is a striking connection between his grisly find and a famous burial ceremony conducted outside Troy, the ancient city described in Homer's Iliad.

To please Cleopatra, the Roman general Anthony acquired a whole orchard of the precious balsam trees near Jericho so she would always have a supply of her favorite fragrance, which cost twice as much as silver. Calling it serpent's poison, sages of the Jewish Talmud recount that the daughters of Jerusalem put balsam in their shoes and, on seeing attractive young men, clicked their heels to release the fragrance as a lure. Today, the only surviving balsam is a 1{ ounce flask covered in palm matting that has lost all its allure.

The Turkish threat is also handy just while the U.S. is deliberating the level of security assistance to Turkey and as Turkey is formally beginning its quest for full European Community membership. This comes at a time, too, of increasing American respect for Mr. Ozal's Turkey, a nation he has transformed from a regulated, inward looking economy into a free market, free trade nation, eager to live up to its security commitments. Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger have both been active in pressing the case for more aid to Turkey, which the Pentagon has labeled the most important NATO need for improvement.

Prehistoric American civilizations were not built by transplanted Egyptians or wandering ancient astronauts, says archaeologist Wilburn Sonny Cockrell of Florida State University. The origin of the mound builders of North America and the pyramid and city dwellers of Central and South America is explored on The Search for Ancient Americans on public television Wednesday night. A number of people, particularly in this century, have come to an almost racist view of the American Indians, said Cockrell.

In addition, such a project will resolve the problem of transporting the Russian oil to Western Europe, the I KATHIMERINI Greek daily writes. The oil pipeline, which will pass through southern Bulgaria, is also viewed as an opportunity to stop the expansionist strivings of Turkey in the region, in which 1.5 million Muslims live, and strengthen security in Thrace, I KATHIMERINI writes.

Albania is convinced that this is in its own interest, as well as in the interest of the Balkans and of Greece itself. But, one should say that other analysts think that making a global evaluation of the Greek policy in the region, the relations with Albania are only a segment of the policy of the Greek phobia towards neighbors or better it is the neighbour phobia which dominates the Greek politics today.

An onshore breeze carries a whiff of sewage to wrinkle the noses of shipowners lounging at the yacht club on the Greek island of Andros. Andros town, the capital, boasts a main street paved with marble and a renowned modern art museum, but it lacks a waste treatment plant. Some Andriot mansions have cesspits, but an estimated 80 per cent of the town's waste pours straight into the Aegean Sea.

The Greeks are eyeing Cyprus with a hearty appetite and are waiting for the day they will get the entire island. The reason is that Cyprus is about 80 km away from our southern coast, while it is much further away from Greece. Now, if the Greeks get the entire island and that is what lies behind the plans for a so called federation they will consider it a continent and thus lay claim to its continental shelf and territorial waters.

His trip was viewed as unlikely to produce any breakthough in major disputes dividing the two Aegean countries, but as one high level Turkish official remarked, The visit in itself is a major achievement.

Greek divers have plunged 162 feet beneath the Aegean Sea and back into history, finding a treasure laden Turkish warship sunk by Greek revolutionaries in 1822. The remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the island of Chios in the eastern Aegean at a point where historical accounts place the sinking of the Ottoman ship, according to Peter Nicolaides, a diver and salvage expert. The Bourloti Seimaz or Explosives Invincible was set afire and sunk by Greek Admiral Constantine Kanaris in revenge for Turkish killing and looting on Chios.

BANIYAS, Israeli annexed Golan Heights (AP) U.S. and Israeli archaeologists have unearthed a Roman metropolis that in its heyday was the ancient world's equivalent of New York. Founded in about A.D. 10 by Herod Philip, son of King Herod the Great, ancient Baniyas grew over the next several hundred years into a huge city, archaeologist Vassilios Tzarferis of the Israel Antiquities Department recently said. We can estimate the population in Roman times of up to 15,000 people, which for those days means it was a New York, Tzarferis said.

By John Barth; Little, Brown, 753 pp., $22.95; WHEN John Barth first emerged on the literary scene in the 1960s with his bizarre writing style, the response was electric.
