With the flick of a tail and the wave of a claw, two huge lobsters were freed Monday in the Atlantic Ocean, safe from seafood lovers after a roundabout landlubbers tour of the Northeast. Shirley, a 25 pound male lobster, and Bob, his 19} pound companion, went down into the sea off foggy Portland Head Light. They had apparently already been hearing the call of the wild and snacked on seafood in the tank where they were being kept before their release.

A 25 pound lobster with claws the size of baseball mitts that was saved from becoming an Easter dinner arrived in Maine on Monday on the final leg of a roundabout journey back to the sea. Maine marine officials gently placed Shirley, a male estimated at 40 to 125 years, and a 19} pound companion lobster into a 600 gallon tub of icy saltwater after their flight from Philadelphia. Freed from their ice packed travel boxes, the lobsters immediately began moving their giant claws around.

Mr. Bush recently assured the lobstermen that, if elected president, he'll still permit them to trap in the waters off his compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, despite possible Secret Service objections. Bush understands, says Robert Brown, the president of Lusty Lobster, a lobster supply business in South Portland. In fact, the lobstermen figure they can't lose in this fall's election.

It was a good year for the company that makes paper for U.S. currency, and that means more folding money for its workers. Crane &amp; Co. officials said Tuesday it would contribute a record $4.5 million to a profit sharing plan for 1,100 employees at three plants in western Massachusetts. The payments amount to between 16 percent and 20 percent of the annual salaries of workers, who make $6 to $12 an hour, officials said.

</P> <P> The alert, twitching California spiny lobster always wins lots of attention, Cosgrove Wake said. The students learn that he doesn't have claws like his cousin from Maine, the family member sometimes offered in upscale restaurants; that his tail can propel him backwards to escape dangers; that like his other cousins, the bugs, he's a scavenger on the ocean floor, and that because his flaps on his tail don't overlap, he is a he and not a she. </P> <P> Real live creatures such as the lobster can spark a fascination that may overcome what is, for many children, a dreaded word science.

The Passive Integrated Tag Gun actually is a pistol shaped sensing unit connected to a computer; it sets off an alarm when it detects a tiny metal tag placed in the body of a lobster, said game warden Mike Castleton. When a lobster is showered with the invisible but harmless beam, the tag number is recorded and displayed on a monitor.

A monster lobster, weighing 35 pounds and believed to be 140 years old, made a big splash at a display in downtown Boston this weekend. The lobster was caught Thursday off the coast of New Bedford when it was dragged in with a load of scallops, said Heather Robertson, spokeswoman for The Boston and Maine Fish Co., which bought the creature. At about 3 foot long, the lobster is believed to be one of the largest and oldest ever captured off the Bay State coast.

Lobstermen are feuding again in the rich lobster fishing areas of Casco Bay, and in one dispute two fishermen were tossed in the harbor, a gun was brandished and a boat damaged.

The panel, which was scheduled to hear arguments on the dispute today, is to recommend a resolution in mid May that could range from leaving the law as it is to banning it altogether. The board of three Americans and two Canadians could also call for a compromise.

President Bush signed legislation Tuesday banning the import of undersized lobsters. The bill was backed by New England lawmakers who presented it both as a conservation measure and as a way to protect U.S. fishermen against Canadian competitors harvesting smaller lobsters. The lobster provision is contained in the $400 million authorization bill for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Fishermen argue that Canada's smaller minimum legal size of lobsters has allowed Canadian fishermen to catch and sell smaller, cheaper lobsters in U.S. markets. The legislation signed by Bush would place a market representing roughly half of Candada's lobster exports off limits for the sale of short lobsters. The current minimum legal size in the United States is 3\ inches from the eye socket to the edge of the back where the tail begins.

The Canadian minimum is one sixteenth of an inch smaller. Up to now, U.S. law has not regulated the size of imported lobsters. In coming years, U.S. regulations would gradually increase the minimum size of a lobster that could be caught in U.S. waters.

Up to now, U.S. law has not regulated the size of imported lobsters. In coming years, U.S. regulations would gradually increase the minimum size of a lobster that could be caught in U.S. waters. Because Canada would not be bound by the increased minimum size regulation, its fishermen could continue to deplete the harvest and compete unfairly with their U.S. counterparts, lobster fishermen argued.

Lobstermen who staged a 10 day strike to protest wholesale prices were back at work Tuesday after receiving assurances dealers would pay more in the future. The fishermen went back to work Monday in a good faith deal with buyers for future price increases, said David Cousens, a representative of the Maine Lobstermen's Association. We were successful, but we paid for it dearly, Cousens said.

But the lobstermen who lobbied the state to enact the new rules say that it was their livelihood that was threatened by the fishing method used by the Vietnamese. The dispute has led to tension between the two sides, including one incident in which a lobsterman brandished gun at a Vietnamese fisherman, the Vietnamese said.
