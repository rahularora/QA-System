The author obtained the results in a number of experiments using one experimental setup and identical conditions. This was done to eliminate the effect of technical perturbations of the resonator. The qualitative difference in the behavior of the free generation of chromium and neodymium ions suggests a physical mechanism which causes nonattenuating radiation pulsations in lasers using ions with an external working shell linked with the spallation of the working levels of the ions in their own radiation field.

It is unambiguously found that chromium ion lasers, in contrast to neodymium ion lasers, have a distinct physical mechanism which causes nonattenuating pulsation of radiation intensity. Any mechanism associated with spatial interaction of modes in the active medium is ruled out. The difference in the lasers is ascribed to the great difference in the structure of the ions' working levels.
 FBIS4-23057 
Any mechanism associated with spatial interaction of modes in the active medium is ruled out. The difference in the lasers is ascribed to the great difference in the structure of the ions' working levels. The electric field of the laser radiation which arises in the active medium will affect only chromium ions, leading to further spallation of the working levels due to the dynamic Stark effect.

The difference in the lasers is ascribed to the great difference in the structure of the ions' working levels. The electric field of the laser radiation which arises in the active medium will affect only chromium ions, leading to further spallation of the working levels due to the dynamic Stark effect. When the field in the active medium is spatially inhomogeneous, a standing wave is formed whose spatial structure is altered during generation.

When the field in the active medium is spatially inhomogeneous, a standing wave is formed whose spatial structure is altered during generation. The Stark effect leads to modulation of intensity over time and nonattenuating pulsations in intensity.

When the field in the active medium is spatially inhomogeneous, a standing wave is formed whose spatial structure is altered during generation. The Stark effect leads to modulation of intensity over time and nonattenuating pulsations in intensity. When the spatial inhomogeneity of the field in the active medium is smoothed, this intensity modulation disappears.

The Stark effect leads to modulation of intensity over time and nonattenuating pulsations in intensity. When the spatial inhomogeneity of the field in the active medium is smoothed, this intensity modulation disappears. This conclusion was verified experimentally using titanium lasers.

When the spatial inhomogeneity of the field in the active medium is smoothed, this intensity modulation disappears. This conclusion was verified experimentally using titanium lasers. It may also be concluded that free generation of all rare earth ions in various media should occur in quasi stationary mode without the need to smooth the spatial inhomogeneity of the field in the active medium.

Laser weapons would most likely be mounted in space: People tried to shoot laser beams through the sky and what they discovered was fog and rain, said William Bridges of California Institute of Technology. Quantum well lasers fill only one niche, but an important one. Their speed and efficiency makes them ideal for rapid fire communication, initially for long distance calls, later for links between neighboring computers and eventually for the links between chips in computers, said Robert Melcher, a laser expert for IBM in Zurich, Switzerland.

In search of a way to avoid this drawback, the dye excitation and lasing dynamics are analyzed for limitations on stable and efficient performance.

In search of a way to avoid this drawback, the dye excitation and lasing dynamics are analyzed for limitations on stable and efficient performance. As the main limiting factors are regarded not only both turbulence modes and thermal convection but also photodecay of dye molecules upon incidence of a pumping radiation pulse, their subsequent restoration, and the stroboscopic effect.

The oscillator operates in the single longitudinal mode and single transverse mode. The two amplifiers operate in the four pass mode. The beam emitted by the oscillator in pulses of 3 mJ energy and 25 ns duration passes through a x10 magnifying telescope, a 12x12 mm[.sup]2[/] large aperture stop, and then two Faraday isolators before entering the first amplifier stage.

Such a laser set can be modified for simultaneous radiation emission at two different frequencies. This can be achieved by splitting the beam into two in the preamplifier stage, using a device such as a Fresnel biprism, and directing each half beam to a different SBMS mirror cell: one containing a compressed gas and one containing a solid substance.

This can be achieved by splitting the beam into two in the preamplifier stage, using a device such as a Fresnel biprism, and directing each half beam to a different SBMS mirror cell: one containing a compressed gas and one containing a solid substance. Then while the beam is being focused, a traveling interference pattern will form in the focal plane owing to different radiation wavelengths in the two half apertures.

Yushkaytis; UDC 681.586:681.7.068] [Abstract] A method is proposed for construction of multiplex systems of fiber optical interferometric sensors entirely without optical directional couplers. In these systems, the signal waves are formed by reflecting a portion of the radiation, propagating in the fiber lightguide, from semi transparent mirrors, built within it, or from the internal nonhomogenieties of the lightguide itself. When they arrive back into the laser cavity, the lasing amplitude changes.

Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO [Text] Mitsubishi Electric has developed short wavelength, high output oscillation technology using a solid state YAG laser. It was difficult to obtain the high output short wavelength laser light because the wavelength conversion element, which transforms the YAG laser light (infrared light) into short wavelength light, tends to cause crystal destruction. The company avoided crystal destruction by bringing about a gentle frequency conversion.

It was difficult to obtain the high output short wavelength laser light because the wavelength conversion element, which transforms the YAG laser light (infrared light) into short wavelength light, tends to cause crystal destruction. The company avoided crystal destruction by bringing about a gentle frequency conversion. It achieved this by lengthening the frequency conversion element and increasing the optical beam size of the YAG laser by an order of millimeters 10 times that of conventional types.

Using this technology, Mitsubishi achieved the oscillation of 24 watt green laser light. Furthermore, it is said that not only green laser light but also blue laser light and other high output oscillations are possible. The solid state laser which oscillates short wavelength laser light consists of an excitation light source, a YAG laser (a yttrium aluminum garnet laser doped with niobium), a nonlinear optical material which is the wavelength conversion element, and other components.

Teplova, Scientific Production Association </F> of Polymer Building Materials; UDC 678.58.691.16.621.791.94] [Abstract] The widening gap between the physical and engineering base of the construction industry and today's standards, the low mechanization level of roofing operations, and the increasing popularity of soft bitumen based materials prompted the National Scientific Research Institute of Polymer Building Materials together with the Tekhnopom National Scientific and Engineering Center to examine the effectiveness of shaped cutting of rolled bitumen impregnated roofing materials using a specialized laser system. To this end, CW, pulse, and periodic pulse CO[.sup]2[/], garnet, ruby, and Nd glass lasers are tested. The experiment demonstrates that CO[.sup]2[/] CW lasers with a 1 6 kgf/cm[.sup]2[/] air injection to the cutting zone are optimum for materials moving at a high velocity relative to the beam.

Powerful beams of green light have been produced previously, but by gas lasers, explained Michael H. McLaughlin, manager of laser technology at GE's big research and development center here. Solid state lasers have the advantage of being smaller and more compact and thus more amenable to various applications. But until now, beams of green light from solid state lasers have been relatively weak and there have been some questions of whether it is possible to use the frequency doubling trick to produce high powered beams of light from solid state lasers.

The beam was fed into a so called face pumped laser that pumped up the power of the beam to 92 watts. In the next step, the 92 watt beam was focused on a crystal of lithium triborate which doubled the frequency of part of the beam, jumping it into the green part of the light spectrum from the infrared.

Moreover, the green beam was of good quality, meaning it tended to stay narrow and steady. Green light is easily absorbed by certain plastic composites and thus the more powerful beam might be useful in machining such composites, the company said.

Toshiba said demand is increasing for devices with higher output power and a shorter wavelength in order to store data at a higher density and read the data more accurately. The higher the density becomes, the more power is required for writing and reading data.

As the PC market has become price driven, Compaq's market share has dropped. What they're doing now is looking for ways to get incremental business and maybe offering a printer will give them an edge in the corporate market.

CSO [Text] Sharp developed technology for oscillation with a high output semiconductor laser which emits 680 nanometer red light. By attaching a transparent layer, which acts as a window, to the laser's end surface, Sharp was able to achieve the world's highest output (295 milliwatts) by preventing heat generation, which occurs when the end surface of the crystal absorbs light and deteriorates. This achievement will raise the reliability during the recording and reading of data on optical discs.

A zinc selenide laser that produces a blue beam and can be focused more tightly than other lasers could eventually triple the amount of information stored on optical computer disks, its developer says. Japanese researchers in March developed a zinc selenide laser, but it had to be cooled to 135 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, according to the University of Florida, which announced a more practical, room temperature laser. Zinc selenide produces a blue beam that can focus on a spot one third the size of that produced by current materials, packing information more densely on optical disks, increasing capacity.
