 LA011490-0104 
First, Madden's views. </P> <P> Question: Can the Rams beat the 49ers? </P> <P> Answer: The Rams are going to have to come up with their best defensive game of the year.
 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> Question: Can the Rams beat the 49ers? </P> <P> Answer: The Rams are going to have to come up with their best defensive game of the year. If they don't, they're in trouble.
 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> Answer: The Rams are going to have to come up with their best defensive game of the year. If they don't, they're in trouble. Then it becomes a shootout, and they're going to have to score a hell of a lot of points.
 LA011490-0104 
If they don't, they're in trouble. Then it becomes a shootout, and they're going to have to score a hell of a lot of points. </P> <P> I mean, the Rams can score a lot of points.
 LA011490-0104 
Then it becomes a shootout, and they're going to have to score a hell of a lot of points. </P> <P> I mean, the Rams can score a lot of points. They're capable of doing that.
 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> I mean, the Rams can score a lot of points. They're capable of doing that. But I really believe the Rams, defensively, are going to have to play above their heads.

They're capable of doing that. But I really believe the Rams, defensively, are going to have to play above their heads. </P> <P> Q: Might the 49ers, who manhandled Minnesota last weekend, be a little overconfident and maybe a little complacent?

But I really believe the Rams, defensively, are going to have to play above their heads. </P> <P> Q: Might the 49ers, who manhandled Minnesota last weekend, be a little overconfident and maybe a little complacent? </P> <P> A: If it was anyone but the Rams, they could be.
 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> Q: Might the 49ers, who manhandled Minnesota last weekend, be a little overconfident and maybe a little complacent? </P> <P> A: If it was anyone but the Rams, they could be. If the Giants had won, they could be.
 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> A: If it was anyone but the Rams, they could be. If the Giants had won, they could be. But they know first hand what the Rams can do.
 LA011490-0104 
If the Giants had won, they could be. But they know first hand what the Rams can do. They have too much respect for the Rams.
 LA011490-0104 
But they know first hand what the Rams can do. They have too much respect for the Rams. </P> <P> I've been working on my All Madden team and have talked with some of the 49ers, and when I ask what team, besides the 49ers, is the best, every guy says the Rams.

 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> Q: Should the Rams try to put a lot of pressure on Joe Montana? </P> <P> A: They're going to have to pressure him to stay in the middle, like they did (Philadelphia's Randall) Cunningham. I don't think sacks, either way, are going to be a big thing in this game.

</P> <P> A: They're going to have to pressure him to stay in the middle, like they did (Philadelphia's Randall) Cunningham. I don't think sacks, either way, are going to be a big thing in this game.

 LA011490-0104 
They can't let John Taylor break away like he did against them in that Monday night game. The Rams look like they're tackling better since that game. </P> <P> You're not going to shut out Rice and Taylor.
 LA011490-0104 
The Rams look like they're tackling better since that game. </P> <P> You're not going to shut out Rice and Taylor. But when they do catch the ball, you've got to tackle them, put the clamps on 'em.

</P> <P> Q: You grew up with John Robinson in Daly City, Calif. He has been your lifelong friend and he once coached your running backs when you were coaching the Oakland Raiders. Last week, Robinson said, despite his reputation for being a running coach, that he has really been a passing coach all along.
 LA011490-0104 
He has been your lifelong friend and he once coached your running backs when you were coaching the Oakland Raiders. Last week, Robinson said, despite his reputation for being a running coach, that he has really been a passing coach all along. </P> <P> A: I don't believe that.
 LA011490-0104 
Last week, Robinson said, despite his reputation for being a running coach, that he has really been a passing coach all along. </P> <P> A: I don't believe that. I say that respectfully.
 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> A: I don't believe that. I say that respectfully. It's just that I know John as well as anybody.
 LA011490-0104 
I say that respectfully. It's just that I know John as well as anybody. He is a running coach.
 LA011490-0104 
It's just that I know John as well as anybody. He is a running coach. He knows more about runners and running backs than any coach in the league, maybe more than anyone who has ever coached in this league.
 LA011490-0104 
He is a running coach. He knows more about runners and running backs than any coach in the league, maybe more than anyone who has ever coached in this league. </P> <P> But he's not dumb.
 LA011490-0104 
He knows more about runners and running backs than any coach in the league, maybe more than anyone who has ever coached in this league. </P> <P> But he's not dumb. He's smart enough to know that with the personnel he now has, passing is the way to go.
 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> But he's not dumb. He's smart enough to know that with the personnel he now has, passing is the way to go. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out, not when you have guys like Jim Everett and Flipper Anderson and Henry Ellard.

 LA011490-0104 
They've even been working Ron Brown into the offense. </P> <P> Q: Looking at it from another point of view, what must the 49ers do to win? </P> <P> A: I think it's the same for the 49ers as the Rams.
 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> Q: Looking at it from another point of view, what must the 49ers do to win? </P> <P> A: I think it's the same for the 49ers as the Rams. The team that tackles the best is going to win this game.
 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> A: I think it's the same for the 49ers as the Rams. The team that tackles the best is going to win this game. The 49ers aren't going to get a lot of sacks.

 LA011490-0104 
The 49ers aren't going to get a lot of sacks. </P> <P> What the 49ers have to do is help Montana get into his rhythm. If he does that, the 49ers are going to be hard to beat.
 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> What the 49ers have to do is help Montana get into his rhythm. If he does that, the 49ers are going to be hard to beat. </P> <P> I'm not saying it can't be done.
 LA011490-0104 
If he does that, the 49ers are going to be hard to beat. </P> <P> I'm not saying it can't be done. Once the Rams beat Philadelphia, all they had to do to get to the Super Bowl was beat two teams they beat during the season, the Giants and 49ers.
 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> I'm not saying it can't be done. Once the Rams beat Philadelphia, all they had to do to get to the Super Bowl was beat two teams they beat during the season, the Giants and 49ers. And they've already done half of that.

Once the Rams beat Philadelphia, all they had to do to get to the Super Bowl was beat two teams they beat during the season, the Giants and 49ers. And they've already done half of that. </P> <P> And now from Walsh.
 LA011490-0104 
And they've already done half of that. </P> <P> And now from Walsh. </P> <P> Q: The last two times Denver and Cleveland met for the AFC championship, the Broncos won both times, first on a 15 play, 98 yard drive and then when the Browns' Earnest Byner fumbled on the three yard line.

 LA011490-0104 
Might the Browns be a little gun shy? </P> <P> A: That's a good point. If they have to measure every step and worry about making a mistake, they'll be in trouble.
 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> A: That's a good point. If they have to measure every step and worry about making a mistake, they'll be in trouble. In a game like this, you have to let it fly.
 LA011490-0104 
If they have to measure every step and worry about making a mistake, they'll be in trouble. In a game like this, you have to let it fly. It's up to (Coach) Bud Carson to keep the team loose, and it's up to (owner) Art Modell not to put any extra heat on them publicly.

It's up to (Coach) Bud Carson to keep the team loose, and it's up to (owner) Art Modell not to put any extra heat on them publicly. </P> <P> Q: You were a passing coach. What's your opinion of the two quarterbacks in this game, Cleveland's Bernie Kosar and Denver's John Elway?
 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> Q: You were a passing coach. What's your opinion of the two quarterbacks in this game, Cleveland's Bernie Kosar and Denver's John Elway? </P> <P> A: They're two of the best quarterbacks in football.
 LA011490-0104 
What's your opinion of the two quarterbacks in this game, Cleveland's Bernie Kosar and Denver's John Elway? </P> <P> A: They're two of the best quarterbacks in football. Elway is more active.
 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> A: They're two of the best quarterbacks in football. Elway is more active. Kosar has a quicker release and is more accurate on shorter passes.
 LA011490-0104 
Elway is more active. Kosar has a quicker release and is more accurate on shorter passes. </P> <P> Q: And the receivers?
 LA011490-0104 
Kosar has a quicker release and is more accurate on shorter passes. </P> <P> Q: And the receivers? </P> <P> A: Both teams also have a lot of talent in this area.
 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> Q: And the receivers? </P> <P> A: Both teams also have a lot of talent in this area. It's really a tossup.
 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> A: Both teams also have a lot of talent in this area. It's really a tossup. Webster Slaughter, Reggie Langhorne, Ozzie Newsome and Eric Metcalf coming out of the backfield for the Browns is a very talented group.
 LA011490-0104 
It's really a tossup. Webster Slaughter, Reggie Langhorne, Ozzie Newsome and Eric Metcalf coming out of the backfield for the Browns is a very talented group. </P> <P> We talked to Elway about his receivers before the Pittsburgh game.
 LA011490-0104 
Webster Slaughter, Reggie Langhorne, Ozzie Newsome and Eric Metcalf coming out of the backfield for the Browns is a very talented group. </P> <P> We talked to Elway about his receivers before the Pittsburgh game. He knows his people so well.
 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> We talked to Elway about his receivers before the Pittsburgh game. He knows his people so well. He said Mark Jackson is the quickest and Vance Johnson is also quick, and more dependable.
 LA011490-0104 
He knows his people so well. He said Mark Jackson is the quickest and Vance Johnson is also quick, and more dependable. Michael Young has the best hands and runs the best routes.
 LA011490-0104 
He said Mark Jackson is the quickest and Vance Johnson is also quick, and more dependable. Michael Young has the best hands and runs the best routes. He is extremely good.
 LA011490-0104 
Michael Young has the best hands and runs the best routes. He is extremely good. When it's third down and they need the yards, Young is the guy Elway likes to go to.
 LA011490-0104 
He is extremely good. When it's third down and they need the yards, Young is the guy Elway likes to go to. They don't use Ricky Nattiel that much, but he's good going downfield.
 LA011490-0104 
When it's third down and they need the yards, Young is the guy Elway likes to go to. They don't use Ricky Nattiel that much, but he's good going downfield. And Steve Sewell, like Metcalf for the Browns, is good coming out of the backfield.
 LA011490-0104 
They don't use Ricky Nattiel that much, but he's good going downfield. And Steve Sewell, like Metcalf for the Browns, is good coming out of the backfield. </P> <P> Q: The consensus seems to be the Super Bowl winner will again come from the NFC.

 LA011490-0104 
</P> <P> Q: The consensus seems to be the Super Bowl winner will again come from the NFC. Do you agree? </P> <P> A: Well, Cincinnati came close to the 49ers last year (the Bengals lost, 20 16), so that shows anything can happen.
 LA011490-0104 
Do you agree? </P> <P> A: Well, Cincinnati came close to the 49ers last year (the Bengals lost, 20 16), so that shows anything can happen. But there is no question the NFC is the stronger, more physical conference.

The 49ers and Giants provided a distraction from the Persian Gulf War for several hours, but the result probably left the 49ers fans feeling more downtrodden than before they arrived.
