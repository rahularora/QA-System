What is most disturbing in the attacks against the MLA and individual members is the persistent resort to misrepresentation and false labeling. While loudly invoking rational debate, open discussion and responsible scholarship, these attacks distort evidence and reduce complex issues to slogans and name calling. Further, they fail to acknowledge the many differences in philosophical and other positions represented among proponents for curricular change who, whether or not one agrees with them, are raising important questions about culture, language and society.

In this context, it is useful to recall that the Modern Language Association arose in 1883 precisely out of such controversy the opposition to adding the teaching of English and other modern languages and literatures to a curriculum dominated by Greek and Latin.

In hopes of making Greeks more familiar with their ancestors' ideas, the education minister has ordered high school students to start taking daily classes in ancient Greek in September. The decision by Education Minister Antonis Tritsis was reached after months of public debate by scholars and educators, but some teachers claim the language used by Homer, Plato and the great Greek dramatists might confuse young students and be too hard for them to learn. Ancient Greek ideas should have a living medium in the world today, Tritsis said in an interview, and I think that living medium is the Greek people who continue to speak the same language as the ancient Greeks.

The country's non oil exports, which were more than $600 million in 1977, dwindled to less than $260 million out of a total of $13.2 billion in 1985, according to the IMF. Another severe blow to the country's economic performance and development has been the emigration of more than 2.5 million Iranians since the start of the Islamic Republic.

While the number of bachelor's degrees awarded increased 88 percent in the past two decades, degrees in the humanities dropped 33 percent, said her report released Sunday.

Communist authorities are ordering China's rambunctious students to sit through special summer school classes geared toward ridding them of yearnings for democracy and a better life for intellectuals. Official reports today said the government ordered universities to use summer school to teach students to support state policies and to enhance students' consciousness about the difficulties of implementing them. In China, students every summer are sent for several weeks to farms, factories and businesses to learn from the masses.

I predict a lot of highbrow furrowing at the new PBS series, Art of the Western World, which begins tonight and continues for eight Mondays (9 10 p.m. EDT and EST). Connoisseurs will abhor seeing two millenniums of masterpieces crammed into that despicable invention, the cathoderay tube. And intellectuals will detest hearing Western culture reduced to voice over narration, even if it is delivered by several respected art historians and the ever so Oxonian host, Michael Wood.

And the railroads in the U.S. carry a significant share of the country's freight a little more than one third of long distance traffic with no other system carrying more than 5% to 8% (and neither the British nor the Japanese railroads carry even that much). The American railroads based this turnaround on the existing values of their managers, their clerks, their train crews on the railroaders' dedication to technical standards, for instance.

So 40 years after the nation's founding, a preliminary legal system still is nowhere to be found, so naturally the country cannot be ruled by law.

To see what this could mean, open Granta 36, which is mostly given over to essays about the Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa's failed campaign for the presidency of his country. Mr. Vargas Llosa, one of the great living practitioners of his language, himself contributes a piece called A Fish Out of Water. With rich irony, he describes the campaign the mortal dangers of speechifying in guerrilla territory, the awful lack of privacy and then tells how he saved himself: At night, before going to sleep, I read poetry always the classics of the Spanish Golden Age, and usually Gongora.

<P> In the decade since the overthrow of the regime of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and the start of the Iranian revolution, a virulent strain of Islamic fundamentalism has spread throughout the Muslim world, espousing a social order that appears to promote medieval attitudes, to restrict individual freedoms and to foster misogynist beliefs. Yet, women in one Muslim country after another, many of them educated in the West, have flocked to its banner, repudiating Western clothing and value systems and declaring themselves willing to fight and die for their beliefs. </P> <P> Those early Western inspired feminist movements in such countries as Egypt, Iran, Lebanon and even Turkey, which sought to improve the lot of women through legislation limiting polygamy and restricting men's freewheeling divorce and custody rights, appear to be dead.

The truth is that the countries of the former Soviet Union are exerting great efforts to acquire their own culture and identity and to return to their historic Islamic roots. Meanwhile, the West is trying to propagate its own culture and to encourage these countries to follow Western culture. Thus, having strong cultural ties with these countries, and especially with Muslim inhabited areas, can help them become acquainted with the Persian language and culture and with Islamic teachings and also help them realize that, like Iran, they can use Islamic culture to further enrich their society, language, literature, and culture and can do without the West.

Secretary of Education William J. Bennett charged Monday that recent changes in its Western culture course requirements at Stanford University represented a victory for radical students who employed the tactics of intimidation. A great university was brought low by the very forces which modern universities came into being to oppose ignorance, irrationality and intimidation, Bennett charged in a speech prepared for delivery on the Stanford campus in California. Stanford President Donald Kennedy denied Bennett's allegations and accused Bennett of using his bully pulpit to bully rather than to engage the issues.

In the multiple choice test, 40% of the students couldn't place the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor between 1939 and 1943, 39% couldn't pin down the writing of the U.S. Constitution between 1750 and 1800, and 69% couldn't identify the Magna Carta as a foundation of parliamentary government. About two thirds didn't know the authors of The Canterbury Tales (Geoffrey Chaucer), Leaves of Grass (Walt Whitman) or The Brothers Karamazov (Fyodor Dostoevski).

BFN <F P=106> [Editorial: The Satellite Dish ] </F> [Text] The use of satellite dishes is among the hottest subjects being debated in political and cultural circles of this country today. Satellite receivers went up on rooftops of Tehran and other big cities with amazing speed in the last two years. The use of these dishes, in and of itself, does not constitute a reprehensible act, and can even be considered useful in disseminating news and information on a global level.

Satellite receivers went up on rooftops of Tehran and other big cities with amazing speed in the last two years. The use of these dishes, in and of itself, does not constitute a reprehensible act, and can even be considered useful in disseminating news and information on a global level. The disturbing aspect of this mass communications device, however, is that it is being used by the West to gradually and subtly dilute non Western cultures and change the prevailing social, political, and cultural standards of the Third World.

EDITOR'S NOTE The 20th edition of Dewey Decimal Classification, which assigns numbers to library books, is due out this year. It's a simple yet sophisticated system for organizing the world's knowledge, a system that a child can quickly learn. While it must be updated from time to time, some librarians maintain that Dewey's system will stand for all time.
 AP890327-0190 
When Melvil Dewey envisioned how a library should be organized more than a century ago, he couldn't have guessed how his system would be tested in the future. He could hardly have foreseen in 1873, for example, the invention of computers, or the spread of AIDS and advancements in medical science such diseases engender. Or the high speed, low cost printing presses that turn out so very many books each year.

This is how a pedagogical catchall like Introduction to Poetry could come into being a single course on a specific subject expected to serve, all at the same time, a utilitarian function (by training students how to read and write), a research function (by preparing future English majors for the scholarly study of literature) and a liberal arts function (by exposing students to high culture). ; Even at schools where there is no actual Introduction to Poetry course, the overall effect of the undergraduate curriculum is the same. Students in the humanities are expected to major in a field French, say, or religion that will provide them with a lot of knowledge most of which will be useful only in the unlikely event they decide to enter graduate school and become professors themselves.

[passage omitted] Hope and Challenge is the title of a strategy that stems from historical awareness of the events in the present phase crucial events in rare and extraordinary circumstances. This historical, principled awareness exposes weak analyses and political theories that judge events in the superficial traditional way that sees the near and distant Arab future only through U.S. and Zionist analyses and the influence of Western propaganda.

This historical, principled awareness exposes weak analyses and political theories that judge events in the superficial traditional way that sees the near and distant Arab future only through U.S. and Zionist analyses and the influence of Western propaganda.

In effect, says Jusuf Wanandi, the director of Jakarta's Center for Strategic and International Studies, the campaign against politicized Islam has ended in a deal: Moslems agreed that theirs would be social religious organizations instead of political ones, and what they got in return was the government, military, and intelligence apparatus off their backs.

In admissions policy: Universities should retain their policies of preferential treatment, but should alter their criteria from race to socioeconomic disadvantage. This means that admissions officers would take into account such factors as the applicant's family background, financial condition and primary and secondary school environment, giving preference to disadvantaged students so long as it is clear that they can be reasonably expected to meet the academic challenges of the university. Race or ethnicity, however, would cease to count either for or against any applicant.
