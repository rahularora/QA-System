The far side of the moon, last photographed by Apollo astronauts two decades ago, was captured on film again by the Galileo spacecraft when it zoomed past the Earth on its long voyage to Jupiter. It's staggering to realize we've been neglecting our own satellite, said Torrence Johnson, Galileo's chief scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Astronauts with the 1969 1972 Apollo lunar missions photographed the back side of the moon, but Johnson said Thursday the last good pictures before Galileo were made by unmanned lunar orbiters during the 1960s.

A subsequent journey through the Earth's magnetic field gave scientists their first measurements of a solar storm in which magnetically charged ions take on higher energy levels.

A subsequent journey through the Earth's magnetic field gave scientists their first measurements of a solar storm in which magnetically charged ions take on higher energy levels. The data could reveal whether the majority of these ions, which trigger colorful auroras near Earth's magnetic poles, come from the sun or Earth, said Lou Frank, chairman of Galileo's magnetic field working group.

NASA scientists said Sunday they plan to launch the Rolls Royce of spacecraft from a space shuttle Oct. 12, catapulting the ship Galileo to Jupiter so it can parachute a probe into the giant planet's atmosphere. During its looping voyage toward a December 1995 rendezvous with Jupiter, the spacecraft will fly by Venus, pass Earth twice, see parts of the moon not seen since the early 1960s and make the first close approach to an asteroid, the researchers said. The swings past Venus and Earth will catapult the spacecraft to higher speeds so that it can reach Jupiter with the least expenditure of fuel, the researchers said.

The Galileo spaceship swooped past Venus early Saturday, and the cloud shrouded planet acted as a gravity slingshot to help hurl the craft toward its 1995 rendezvous with Jupiter. Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a radio signal confirming that the 2.8 ton spacecraft made its closest approach to Venus at 12:59 a.m. EST, cruising 10,028 miles above the planet's hellishly hot surface. We have just flown through our closest approach point to Venus, said Bill O'Neil, science and mission design manager.

NASA's Galileo spacecraft developed camera trouble today after zooming around cloud covered Venus in a celestial billiard shot that speeded the robot explorer toward its 1995 encounter with Jupiter. Although the glitch threatened to prevent Galileo from snapping five dozen more pictures of Venus tonight and next week, project scientist Torrence Johnson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said it should cause no permanent problems for the mission. Mission director Neal Ausman said the TV camera shutter, after taking 16 planned pictures of Venus early today, clicked open and closed 452 times, twice per minute, apparently because of faulty commands from the probe's main computer.

Because of its bluish color and bright clouds, Neptune looks Earthlike, Porco said. With clouds floating in the atmosphere, it looks homey.

We've now seen four different ring systems at four different planets, Terrile said, citing Saturns vast system of broad rings, Jupiter's single narrow ring, and Uranus' 10 thin rings and one broad sheet of dust that seems to contain dozens of rings.

NASA engineers fired the Galileo spacecraft's tiny thrusters almost 1,600 times in a successful four day maneuver designed to help the space probe reach Jupiter in 1995. The thruster pulses, completed late Thursday, slowed the spacecraft by about 55 mph, said Jim Wilson, spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The next set of maneuvers on the $1.35 billion mission is scheduled for summer, spokesman Bob MacMillin said Monday.

Seven months into its six year, $1.35 billion journey to Jupiter, the Galileo spacecraft ignited its rocket thrusters repeatedly so it can swoop near Earth in December, NASA said. The tiny rocket thrusters were ordered to fire during a two day maneuver that ends late today, said Jim Wilson, a spokesman at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We are changing both the speed and the aim point for our Earth flyby.

Voyager 2, discovered broad, flat bands of dust orbiting Neptune and found evidence the planet has southern lights, NASA said today. The probe also detected nitrogen in the atmosphere of Triton, the moon whose pink snow and ice volcanoes were described by excited scientists as unique in the solar system, NASA said. There's dust bands they're broad, said NASA astronomer Rich Terrile, describing the findings from latest photorgraphs.

Ellis Miner, deputy project scientist, said by measuring changes in the signal, scientists hope to determine Neptune's atmospheric pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup; whether ring arcs are made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and how material is distributed inside Neptune. The radio experiment takes all of Voyager's radio signal strength, so no other data or photographs will be sent back to Earth for about 2{ hours around the time of close encounter, Miner said. When Voyager sends pictures and data to Earth, they take four hours and six minutes to arrive, even traveling at the speed of light, 186,000 miles per second.

Smith said later the boundaries between the five rings aren't well defined, so there could be as few as three rings or as many as five. He reversed himself later Saturday, deciding the rings are distinct enough to count the total as five.

Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, but Pluto's elliptical orbit means it now is closer, making Neptune temporarily the solar system's outmost planet. Someday there ought to be a Pluto flyby, Fisk said. But there are no active plans to do that.

NASA engineers were unwilling to wait until October to see the Galileo spacecraft's photographs of Venus, so they used an experimental method to get three of the pictures sent to Earth early. One of the photos released Wednesday shows clouds as small as 25 miles wide as well as clouds rising from lower in the atmosphere. It was taken Monday night when the Jupiter bound Galileo was about 1 million miles past Venus, the second planet from the sun.

The latest discoveries come from a far off realm, Uranus, relayed by Voyager 2, a marvelous machine launched along with Voyager 1 in 1977 to probe Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 was working so well after exploring Saturn that NASA reprogrammed it to sail past Uranus in 1986 and Neptune next August. Uranus is considered the oddball of the solar system because, unlike the other planets, it lies tipped on its side with its north and south poles alternately facing the sun.

Neptune's icy volcanic moon Triton is the coldest body ever measured in the solar system, NASA said Monday, and the planet itself has something in common with Los Angeles: smog. The Voyager 2 space probe also discovered auroras vaguely like Earth's northern lights on Neptune and Triton, scientists said. Looking backward 3.2 million miles, Voyager 2 on Monday snapped a series of family portraits of Neptune and Triton, appearing as crescents as they were backlighted by the sun.

Looking backward 3.2 million miles, Voyager 2 on Monday snapped a series of family portraits of Neptune and Triton, appearing as crescents as they were backlighted by the sun. Earlier, Voyager 2's ultraviolet detector determined that Triton's surface temperature is 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, making the moon the coldest body we have seen in the solar system, said Roger Yelle of the University of Arizona.

Voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor failures, although it contains electronics equal to 10,000 television sets, he said. Commands sent to Voyager, and photos and information it sends to Earth, travel at the speed of light.

Voyager 2 cruised away from Neptune and toward the stars Tuesday, completing an $865 million trek past 60 worlds, a triumphant exploration that might help humans prevent destruction of their own planet. If you want to understand Earth, go look at other worlds, said Cornell University astronomer Carl Sagan, a member of the team that analyzed about 81,000 photographs taken by Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1. Our passion to explore, our deep need to understand our origins, and the very urgent and practical matter of safeguarding our planet are all enormously enhanced by studying other planets.

Just as Earth's magnetic field traps the Van Allen radiation belts, Neptune's magnetic field also may help create radiation belts around that planet.

Up to four more active ice volcanoes on Neptune's moon Triton were discovered in snapshots taken by Voyager 2, which found the planet itself is swept by 1,500 mph winds the fastest yet seen in the solar system. Because the spacecraft photographed at least two and possibly five of the geyser like volcanoes erupting on only a portion of Triton, chances are that there are a dozen of these things going off globally at any time, said Torrence Johnson, a planetary scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. Confirmation of the first active volcano was announced Oct. 2 after scientists analyzed photos Voyager 2 snapped during its Aug. 24 25 flight past Neptune and Triton.

Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1, were launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla., in 1977.
