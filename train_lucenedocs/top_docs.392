Huge carved stone heads, tiny clay figures and thousands of other artifacts at a museum here tell a strange story about three civilizations that flourished long before Columbus discovered America. It's about the Olmecs, Totonacas and Huaxtecs, who inhabited a long stretch of coast on the Gulf of Mexico. The fascinating and sometimes gruesome story is told vividly at the Museum of Xalapa, which specializes in the region's archaeological treasures.

IN THE few years since its inception, Glasgow's Mayfest has become an important fixture in the British cultural calendar. Natural civic pride and rivalry apart, it is hardly yet the equal of Edinburgh as an international festival of the arts, but who would now say, with enthusiasm on the one side, and complacency on the other, that a full reversal of the relative positions was impossible? So far as the visual arts are concerned, the issue is already nicely balanced.

The work here is of the 1940s, when Creme was taken up by the emigre Polish painters Josef Herman and Jankel Adler then living in Glasgow, and the 1950s when he was in London and one of the circle of Minton, MacBryde, Colquhoun and others. The figure drawings and paintings are especially interesting, sophisticated in their modernism, after Braque and Matisse, yet direct and personal in feeling and character. Up the road at his Compass Gallery (178 West Regent Street: until May 21), Gerber is showing the recent work of a most distinctive Scottish print maker, Elspeth Lamb.

While mainstream Mr and Ms America may be happy to celebrate Europe's Transatlantic leap, the original new worlders (not to mention the watchdogs of political correctness) are demanding apologies and penance for the devastation which the 'white gods' from the east wrought on the indigeous peoples they encountered. There is then a timeliness in The Art of Ancient Mexico, a fascinating and worthy celebration of the arts of the Olmecs, Mayas, Aztecs and other cultures which dominated Mesoamerica for some 3,000 years before the arrival of the Spanish.

The so called 'eccentric flints', fashioned by knapping the brittle stone with extraordinary skill into bizarre forms, remain something of an enigma. Disappointingly, there is not a single piece of 'narrative style' Mayan pottery, in which the native American's show a remarkable facility for two dimensional naturalism an unexpected foil to the mainstream spirit of strict iconographical formalism. One surprise is the virtual silence in which the exhibition passes over the revolution currently taking place in Mayan studies from the decipherment of the Mayan hieroglyphic script.

Deep in a mangrove swamp near the Gulf of Mexico, archaeologists have discovered traces of what could be another ancient Mexican civilization. So far, the only clues to these mysterious people are a four ton stele, or stone slab, covered with hieroglyphic writing and a 19 inch high clay figure of a fertility rite priest. But, says Fernando Winfield Capitaine, director of the Xalapa Museum of Anthropology, the finds are so promising that the museum is planning to mount an expedition to that area of Veracruz state in cooperation with the National Geographic Society.

Deep in a mangrove swamp near the Gulf of Mexico, archaeologists have discovered traces of what could be another ancient Mexican civilization. So far, the only clues to these mysterious people are a four ton stele, or stone slab, covered with hieroglyphic writing and a 19 inch high clay figure of a fertility rite priest. But, says Fernando Winfield Capitaine, director of the Xalapa Museum of Anthropology, the finds are so promising that the museum is planning to mount an expedition to that area of Veracruz state in cooperation with the National Geographic Society.

THE WISDOM of the Aztecs was enshrined in a painted literature. As the conquistadors observed, the great Aztec ruler Moctezuma had libraries full of painted books and scrolls, the work of priest scribes who 'wrote' in colourful images rather like strip cartoons. Human blood was dripped on to the pages to feed the images.

Perhaps no account of the fate of the Amerindians since Columbus could be dispassionate. Home of the Brave, its title ironically provided by The Star Spangled Banner, takes a highly charged subject and does all it can to elicit an emotional and political response from its audience as it is propelled from 15th century Castile to the White House. In more ways than one, this 'amazing new museum experience' is a provocative as well as spectacular European contribution to the Columbus quincentennial.

Yet despite this, the show is a memorable introduction to pre Columbian art. It aims to be more, the theme being 3,000 years of Mexican art from the Oltecs (1200 600 BC) to Frida Kahlo. However, Mexico after its conquest by Hernan Cortes in 1521, is on the whole only thinly evoked with certain exceptions from New Spain.

<P> The Los Angeles Festival's emphasis on cultural diversity serves to remind us how culturally mixed the vocabulary of contemporary visual art has become. The festival, with its mandate to focus on the arts of the Southland's various ethnic groups, combined with the afterglow of the Museum of Contemporary Art's just closed A Primal Spirit, has made it abundantly clear that the work of contemporary visual artists cannot justifiably be roped off into isolated cultural communities. The artists may indeed base their work on their own heritage, but increasingly they are deeply affected by the conceptual movements and vocabulary of Western art that makes them participants in the globe trotting '90s' internationalization of art.

<P> An American penny becomes a cobra snake with a long thin mass of copper stretched between the coin's head and tail ; a nurse's cap becomes a mother's breast complete with a nipple sculpted from human hair; a crucifix becomes an old fashioned scale, with the weights consisting of two bags of gold resembling figures in mourning; and an American flag becomes a literal black and white, stars and stripes image with the stars coming from a photograph of the night sky. </P> <P> Such are the works of mixed media artist Tim Hawkinson, who manipulates everyday objects and the notions we hold about them to create a diverse body of artwork. </P> <P> A lot of the work comes from an investigation of social and personal views of the objects, said Hawkinson, who has a one person show at Wilshire Boulevard's Ace Gallery through Saturday, and will be included in a three person show opening at Santa Monica's Michael Kohn Gallery on Thursday (through Aug. 25).

In Dunce's Dream, where he gives up his fancy free brushwork for a cast of firmly outlined figures, he miscalculates. The cast of characters has a shopworn quality, and the tone seems ponderously allegorical. The viewer begins to suspect that what counts in Almaraz's work is not so much his ideas as his insight into moments of perception particularly involving light and his intense dedication to the physical activity of painting.

ANNANDALE ON HUDSON, N.Y. (AP) It's been a long, strange trip for the oil painting of the nude woman and Cupid now hanging in a Bard College gallery. The painting was found years ago in a hayloft with a modest fig leaf painted on Cupid and the chubby, prone woman's breasts enlarged. A private collector bought the painting, removed the bogus overpainting and cleaned it over three years.
