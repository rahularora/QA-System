It was part of what explorer Zebulon Pike in 1806 called the Great American Desert, the High Plains where grass was the natural crop and buffaloes roamed far and wide. Pike's adventures along the Arkansas River to the Rocky Mountains gave rise to a notion at the time that the huge region of low rainfall, short grass and few natural water holes was a natural barrier that would limit U.S. westward expansion. Farmers tried to tame it with the plow, but often drought and crop failure dominated the huge region, generally west of the 100th meridian.

The novel, set in the late 1970s, is narrated by Ginny, whose father, Larry Cook, owns the biggest and most profitable farm around a thousand acres. Ginny is an accommodating, even malleable, sort, although at 36 she has been bitterly disappointed by a series of miscarriages with her husband, Ty. She's appealingly levelheaded, but not immune to deeper impulses; she confesses to harboring vague desires, secret, passionate wishes.

Election workers had only themselves for company in this rural community in northwestern New Jersey as all eight registered voters sent in absentee ballots. State law requires every municipality to provide a polling place to ensure everybody has a right to vote, so for 13 hours on Tuesday the township's one polling spot stood vacant, except for the three people sharing shifts, including Mayor Donald Von Hagen. Most of the township was bought up in the 1960s by the federal government for its Tocks Island dam project.

The state took control of Kentucky's third largest school district's finances Wednesday, citing a budget deficit estimated by consultants to have been as high as $3.3 million. The action by the State Board of Education means state Superintendent John Brock's written approval will be needed for all hiring and purchases by the Pike County district, which has 15,250 students in 30 schools. The board acted after two consultants it sent into the mountainous eastern Kentucky district reported dozens of management problems.

In a similar way, he says the growing multitude of homeless Americans is a crisis not just in the lives of individual victims, but a crisis in the whole identification of this nation. As chairman of an organization described as the nation's largest private local program providing the homeless with food, shelter and some permanent housing, Pike added in an interview: The growing callousness and willingness of people to live side by side with this tragedy affects everyone. What we see is the erosion of the worth of life, of the dignity of the human person.

The date on the newspaper is convincing enough, but Pike is suspicious when everyone is vague on the identity of the mayor of Chicago and who won the World Series. Joanna Pacula, who is making a career of TV World War II dramas ( Crossings, Escape from Sobibor ), plays Anna, the German nurse enlisted to entice Pike into spilling the beans, because she looks exactly like the wife the Nazis have told him is dead. No wonder she and his wife look alike.

It may sound like a childhood nightmare come true: People buying specially wrapped gift boxes of onions. But this is the age of the designer onion, and industry officials say the lower Rio Grande Valley's grapefruit size variety known as the Texas 1015 SuperSweet has onion enthusiasts crying for more. At least eight packers are shipping gift boxes from the Valley at prices amounting to a dollar or more per onion.

A hazing incident has led to the banishment of a Stetson University fraternity that got into trouble over rape allegations against several members last year. The Baptist affiliated school announced Wednesday that it had withdrawn recognition of Pi Kappa Alpha as a result of an investigation that found members had degraded pledges, conducted a public stunt and inflicted mental abuse. A Nov. 9 incident involving frat members, known as Pikes, in the Ocala National Forest reflected poorly on the campus' fraternith and sorority system, the university said in a statement.

Bank of Japan's tightening this past year has only reversed the easing over the previous few years. What Japan needs from the G 7 meeting in Paris among Japan, the U.S., West Germany, U.K., France, Italy and Canada is some coordinated interest rate action with the U.S.,where the Federal Reserve eased rates as Bank of Japan raised them. This would repay the easing that Japan pursued for several years after the Plaza Accord 1985 to support the dollar.

The accord was the first agreement by the G 7 for coordinated attempts to keep the dollar within certain ranges. But what they'll get is probably little but warm words about coordinated policy, says David Pike, chief economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew International Ltd. As a result, there will be a shift of focus back onto the Bank of Japan and a fifth hike in the ODR {official discount rate}.

The state Board of Education today voted to take control of the finances of the debt ridden Pike County school system, citing widespread nepotism in Kentucky's third largest district. The action means that the 15,250 student school system cannot make purchases or hire anyone without written approval from state school Superintendent John Brock. The board acted after receiving a consultants' report detailing dozens of management problems within the state's easternmost county, a coal mining area with 87,000 residents.

Critics say a planned Star Wars test in the South Pacific comes close to violating a 1972 treaty outlawing major missile defenses. Near the middle of the month, a Boeing 767 equipped with a 3 ton infrared sensor will make its first attempt to track a mock warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. The plane is scheduled to depart Boeing Field in Seattle on Monday for a two day trip to Kwajalein Atoll, an Army missile test range in the Pacific.
