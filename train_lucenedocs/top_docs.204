The Golden Gate Bridge made it through the big 1989 earthquake without any apparent damage, but bridge directors think a $100 million quake proofing project would be a wise investment. Quite frankly, that's a good bargain, said director Jim Harberson. He said replacing the 53 year old Golden Gate would cost about $1 billion.

The doctor who cared for Buck Helm, the longshoreman who survived 3{ days in his car in a collapsed section of Interstate 880, said his death Saturday was partly due to a heart condition they had been unaware of. However, Dr. Tom McDonald, chief of surgery at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, told a news conference in Oakland that Helm suffered overwhelming injuries in the freeway collapse that claimed 41 other lives.

In May alone, San Francisco will have a citywide ball for 12,000 people and the annual Bay to Breakers footrace, the world's largest and wildest, with 100,000 joggers dressed as bowling pins or bananas or pulling kegs of beer. Most California bridges are state run, but the Golden Gate is run by the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District, a group of political appointees, and financed by tolls.

About 400,000 commuters trying to find their way through the Bay area's quake torn transportation system wedged cheek to jowl into subways, sat in traffic jams on major freeways or waited forlornly for buses yesterday.

The extent of the claims won't be known for some time, Mr. Leach said. On Friday, during a visit to California to survey quake damage, President Bush promised to meet the federal government's obligation to assist relief efforts. California officials plan to ask Congress for $3 billion or more of federal aid, in the form of grants and low interest loans.

California officials plan to ask Congress for $3 billion or more of federal aid, in the form of grants and low interest loans. The state has a $1 billion reserve, and is expected to add $1 billion to that fund in the next year.

California officials plan to ask Congress for $3 billion or more of federal aid, in the form of grants and low interest loans. The state has a $1 billion reserve, and is expected to add $1 billion to that fund in the next year. Some of that money will be available for highway repair and special emergency aid, but members of the legislature are also mulling over a temporary state gasoline tax to raise money for earthquake relief.

Like storm tossed captains plotting a course around rocks and shoals, a million San Francisco Bay area workers their normal commute routes ruined by an earthquake are devising new strategies for getting to and from work. I really don't see how there cannot be gridlock on Monday, said a harried Tom Silvey, a state Franchise Tax Board worker now assigned to the state Office of Emergency Services. Monday is considered the region's transportation equivalent of D day along 70 miles from San Francisco to Santa Cruz.

Tourists though very few of them in the Fisherman's Wharf area Thursday were pointing their cameras at the bleak island in the bay.

<P> Pacific Rim Conference Set: San Francisco, where the Golden Gate Bridge symbolizes the gateway to the Pacific, was chosen to host a major trade and finance symposium expected to attract about 1,000 business and political leaders from Pacific Rim nations. Mayor Art Agnos said the 1990 Pacific Rim Conference was a real coup for San Francisco and would help establish the Bay Area as a major U.S. hub of commerce for an economically powerful Asia Pacific region that encompasses 57 countries and 2.4 billion people. The first Pacific Rim Conference was held in Perth, Western Australia, in November, 1986.

About 80 demonstrators demanding more commitment to stopping AIDS closed the Golden Gate Bridge during Tuesday's morning rush hour, stalling thousands of commuters in a traffic jam. The fog shrouded bridge was closed for 46 minutes while Highway Patrol officers arrested 26 protesters affiliated with a group called Stop AIDS Now Or Else. The demonstrators were cited on charges of trespassing and creating a public nuisance and then released, officials said.

After tackling the 50th anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge, a public relations company has taken on the enormous task of coordinating press coverage of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's visit for free. Other local companies donated eight extra phone lines and four extra facsimile machines to help the PBN Co.'s staff field requests from more than 1,000 media organizations who want credentials for more than 3,000 journalists. It's hopping, PBN founder Peter Necarsulmer said Friday.
