Pictures taken by the Magellan spacecraft suggest that volcanoes still spew Australia sized lava floods on Venus, and the planet didn't abruptly shut down after a global sized eruption 400 million years ago. Venus is not dead, Southern Methodist University scientist Roger Phillips said Monday during the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting. Magellan hasn't yet found direct proof that volcanoes are erupting today on the planet, but it seems likely Venus is still (volcanically) active today, said Steve Saunders, Magellan's chief scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.

Saunders said last month that most of the meteorite impact craters on Venus appeared relatively young and fresh. He said that suggested older impact craters were obliterated by gargantuan floods of lava. At the time, Saunders said that either lava gushed from numerous cracks in the surface to flood 60 percent of Venus during a single catastrophe about 400 million years ago, or that a series of somewhat smaller but still giant lava floods inundate various regions of Venus during different times.

The Magellan spacecraft has found evidence that ocean sized floods of molten rock once inundated more than half the surface of Venus.

NASA scientists who bounced radio waves off cloud shrouded Venus detected huge blobs that may be lava flows and rings that may be volcanic crater rims, both very bright and possibly rich in fool's gold, a new study says. The study provides more evidence that Venus' volcanoes erupted within the last few million years and possibly within recent centuries, said researchers from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Their findings appear in Friday's issue of the journal Science, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the launch of the Pioneer Venus orbiter, a spacecraft that still circles the second planet from the sun.

On Tuesday morning, she marched into class carrying five bona fide Venus' flytraps she had purchased for five dollars each. </P> <P> We don't get reimbursed for things like that, but I feel the kids have to see how it happens, so it's not just something they read in a book, Uyemura explained.

Suspicion focuses on possible damage to electronic components that happened when Magellan started orbiting Venus Aug. 10 and on static in the wiring linking its computers, Slonski said.

Officials in North Carolina say the flytrap, the plant with the bristled leaves that clamp shut on bugs, is in a fight for survival. Developers and industry have crowded the carnivore out of many of the wetlands where it once grew (in the wild, it's now found in only 11 counties in the Carolinas). The shrinking habitat and continuing demand overseas have made the plant a poachers' favorite.

Venus may be a terrible place to live, but scientists believe the planet's torrid temperatures, incredible pressures and sulfuric acid rain may be a great place to learn about the solar system's evolution. A robot craft called Magellan, the first American space probe in 11 years, is on its way to survey Venus for clues to the forces that molded all the inner planets orbiting the sun. The $550 million craft will use a powerful radar imaging system to map Venus' surface, where scientists believe the geologic history of the planet is imprinted.

Plans call for Magellan to formally start its $744 million mission to use radar to makes maps and pictures of Venus' cloud covered surface late this month, Wall said.

The spacecraft Magellan bombarded Venus with radar Saturday in the first attempt to make pictures of the planet's cloud shrouded surface since engineers temporarily lost touch with it last month. Most people are sighing with relief, said Jim Scott, Magellan mission director at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We're just happy to get into the position where we wanted to be.

Magellan ended a two week hiatus Saturday and resumed its radar mapping of the surface of Venus. The lull in the spacecraft's $744 million mission was necessary because Earth, the sun and Venus were lined up in a way that hindered communication between Magellan and controllers at National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Magellan engineer Cynthia Haynie said the orbiter began bouncing radar waves off the cloudy planet at 4:11 a.m. PST.

Magellan will resume making pictures of Venus on Nov. 7 or 8 after engineers fix a computer programming flaw that is causing a wobble in the spacecraft's twin solar power panels, NASA said Wednesday. Meanwhile, a Soviet scientist working on the Magellan project praised the American mission, but said more spacecraft should be sent to Venus to better learn how the planet works geologically. Magellan is a beautiful mission.

NASA engineers today struggled to restore radio contact with Magellan after losing touch with the Venus orbiting spacecraft for the second time in five days. Space agency engineers' failure this morning to hear from Magellan after the link broke indicated the craft's computerized emergency systems didn't immediately activate to help re establish communication with Earth, NASA said.

With Magellan safely in orbit around Venus today, exuberant NASA engineers started preparing the spacecraft for a mapping mission meant to reveal what forces shaped the landscape of the hellishly hot planet. We think we'll see lots of rocky surfaces, hills and dales and volcanoes, said Bill Johnson, chief engineer for Magellan's radar imaging system. Geologists hope the $744 million exploration will reveal the way the planet works internally, the way mountains are built and the way volcanoes work, said Steve Saunders, chief Magellan scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Meanwhile, NASA released new photographs from Magellan that showed a lava filled, 20 mile wide meteorite crater on the planet. Magellan project manager Tony Spear said another theory for the lapses in radio contact is that the braking rocket pulled some cables off or burned some cables as it was jettisoned when the spacecraft went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10.

Even if the rocket had not completely separated, it wouldn't prevent Magellan from conducting its $744 million mission to use radar to make maps and pictures, Spear said. Mapping is likely to start no earlier than mid September, two weeks later than planned, he said.

Here are some unusual facts about the Magellan spacecraft and Venus, culled from The Magellan Venus Explorer's Guide and other NASA publications: Getting Magellan to Venus required three main engines and two rockets on the shuttle Atlantis that carried it into Earth orbit, two rockets on the inertial upper stage booster that hurled it toward Venus, and one braking rocket to slow it down for entry into orbit around Venus. But for 99 percent of Magellan's 948 million mile trip to Venus, it cruised without power. Venus is named for the Roman goddess of love.

Once the shuttle is in orbit, the crew will release Magellan from the cargo bay and a rocket will start it on the 466 day trip to Venus.

Engineers have not determined why the spacecraft has suffered two long communications blackouts but were hopeful that its $744 million mission to map the planet with radar would begin this month. Controllers began sending commands to Magellan early Saturday to awaken it from a so called deep safe mode and put it in a state called random access memory control.

Less detailed radar pictures of Venus from other U.S. and Soviet spacecraft and from a radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, revealed signs of faults on Venus and also found tens of thousands of volcanoes, although scientists still don't know if any are active.

Here are key facts about the Magellan spacecraft, which is scheduled to go into orbit around Venus in August: PRIMARY MISSION: To use radar to penetrate the clouds of Venus and make pictures and maps of 70 percent to 90 percent of the planet's surface with 10 times better detail than any previous images. Magellan will reveal signs of forces that shaped the planet, including volcanism, meteorite impacts and possibly wind, water and large scale movements of the planet's crust. EXTENDED MISSION: A single Venusian day the time it takes the planet to rotate once on its axis lasts 243 Earth days.

An alignment of the planets will interfere with the Magellan spacecraft's ability to send pictures of Venus back to Earth for the next six weeks beginning Sunday, NASA says. During late October and early November, the sun was between Venus and Earth, forcing a two week halt to Magellan's $744 million mission to use radar to map the surface of cloud shrouded Venus. This time, Venus itself gets in the way, although mapping can continue, said Steve Wall, Magellan experiment representative at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

This time, Venus itself gets in the way, although mapping can continue, said Steve Wall, Magellan experiment representative at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Because of the relative positions of Earth and Venus as they orbit the sun, a straight line drawn from the spacecraft to the Earth goes straight through Venus for part of each day during the 42 day period, Wall said Wednesday.

NASA decided to suspend the Magellan spacecraft's Venus map making mission today, three days earlier than planned, because a planetary lineup is affecting its navigation and communications with Earth. It will be at least 12 days before Magellan can resume its $744 million mission to use radar to make pictures and maps of cloud covered Venus, said Jim Scott, mission director at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The space agency had planned to halt mapping by Magellan for nine days starting Monday.

Engineers figured that because the secondary antenna sends out a broader beam than the main antenna, they would be less likely to lose contact with the spacecraft if there were another glitch.

Magellan, a robot spacecraft armed with a sophisticated radar, is ready to rendezvous with Venus and begin an eight month exploration and mapping of the Earth's nearest neighbor, NASA officials said Thursday. The spacecraft is scheduled to complete its 804 million mile voyage to Venus on Aug. 10 when it fires a rocket engine to settle into an orbit that dips to within 170 miles of the planet's surface. Officials said the craft would approach Venus at 24,600 miles per hour and the rocket firing will slow Magellan to 18,400 miles per hour, enough to put it into the planet's orbital grasp.
