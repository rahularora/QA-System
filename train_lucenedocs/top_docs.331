The Voyager 2 space probe discovered that a magnetic field surrounds Neptune, suggesting the planet is enveloped by orbiting radiation belts and has an aurora like Earth's northern lights, NASA announced Friday. Further study of the magnetic field should allow scientists to determine the exact length of a day on Neptune, believed to be 17 to 18 Earth hours, and to gain better understanding of Neptune's internal structure, said Mary Beth Murrill, a spokeswoman for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Just as Earth's magnetic field traps the Van Allen radiation belts, Neptune's magnetic field also may help create radiation belts around that planet.

The latest discoveries come from a far off realm, Uranus, relayed by Voyager 2, a marvelous machine launched along with Voyager 1 in 1977 to probe Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 was working so well after exploring Saturn that NASA reprogrammed it to sail past Uranus in 1986 and Neptune next August. Uranus is considered the oddball of the solar system because, unlike the other planets, it lies tipped on its side with its north and south poles alternately facing the sun.

The Voyagers also discovered a ring around Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system and a valuable astronomical laboratory because of the diversity of its system of at least 16 moons. During the flyby encounters, the Voyagers and the earlier Pioneers 10 and 11, found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid hydrogen, topped by a uniquely colorful atmosphere which is mostly hydrogen and helium.

They will hear a simple message recorded by a 7 year old boy from another time and another world: Greetings from the children of the planet Earth.

Geologists may get a glimpse of what Earth's surface was like a few billion years ago when the Magellan spacecraft's radar pierces the clouds of Venus to reveal secrets of an alien terrain. Venus is the last of the inner planets we are exploring in detail, and probably is the most important from the point of view of understanding the Earth, said Jim Head, a member of NASA's Magellan science team and a geology professor at Brown University in Providence, R.I. Magellan fired its braking rocket and slipped into orbit around Venus on Friday after a 15 month, 948 million mile voyage from Earth. Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory monitored the spacecraft's health Saturday so it will be ready by Sept. 1 to use its radar to peer through thick Venusian clouds and make the most detailed pictures and maps yet of the planet's landscape.

Voyager 2 cruised away from Neptune and toward the stars Tuesday, completing an $865 million trek past 60 worlds, a triumphant exploration that might help humans prevent destruction of their own planet. If you want to understand Earth, go look at other worlds, said Cornell University astronomer Carl Sagan, a member of the team that analyzed about 81,000 photographs taken by Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1. Our passion to explore, our deep need to understand our origins, and the very urgent and practical matter of safeguarding our planet are all enormously enhanced by studying other planets.

Because a planet's internal heat drives the geological machinery, however, scientists believe Venus and Earth both give off heat through volcanic activity and movements of gargantuan pieces of rock along the planetary crust, Saunders said. Magellan should help scientists learn if any of the Venusian volcanoes are still erupting and how crustal rock movements differs from that on Earth.

Venus may be a terrible place to live, but scientists believe the planet's torrid temperatures, incredible pressures and sulfuric acid rain may be a great place to learn about the solar system's evolution. A robot craft called Magellan, the first American space probe in 11 years, is on its way to survey Venus for clues to the forces that molded all the inner planets orbiting the sun. The $550 million craft will use a powerful radar imaging system to map Venus' surface, where scientists believe the geologic history of the planet is imprinted.

Voyager 2, discovered broad, flat bands of dust orbiting Neptune and found evidence the planet has southern lights, NASA said today. The probe also detected nitrogen in the atmosphere of Triton, the moon whose pink snow and ice volcanoes were described by excited scientists as unique in the solar system, NASA said. There's dust bands they're broad, said NASA astronomer Rich Terrile, describing the findings from latest photorgraphs.

It's one of the most interesting and provocative worlds in the solar system, says Charles Kohlhase, Voyager spacecraft mission design manager at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

In another finding, the best close up photo yet of another moon, 1989 N1, showed that Neptune's second largest moon has a huge crater about half as wide as the lumpy looking, 240 mile wide satellite. That indicates that a big meteorite once smacked into 1989 N1, one of six moons discovered since June by Voyager, according to Bradford Smith, the leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team. Voyager also sent back heat measurements to help scientists find liquid lakes or oceans on Triton, but the moon almost certainly is too cold to have them, said Torrence Johnson, a scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory here.

In 27 years the human species has flown close by or landed on every planet in the solar system except Pluto, he said.

With Magellan safely in orbit around Venus today, exuberant NASA engineers started preparing the spacecraft for a mapping mission meant to reveal what forces shaped the landscape of the hellishly hot planet. We think we'll see lots of rocky surfaces, hills and dales and volcanoes, said Bill Johnson, chief engineer for Magellan's radar imaging system. Geologists hope the $744 million exploration will reveal the way the planet works internally, the way mountains are built and the way volcanoes work, said Steve Saunders, chief Magellan scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Reiterating President Bush's July statement in support of an eventual permanent base on the Earth's moon and a manned trip to Mars, Quayle declared: We Americans have been opening new frontiers throughout our history and we will continue to do so. Today, space is America's frontier. Lennard Fisk, an associate administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, called the climax of the Voyager mission historic because it's the last time we're seeing a planet for the first time.

Up to four more active ice volcanoes on Neptune's moon Triton were discovered in snapshots taken by Voyager 2, which found the planet itself is swept by 1,500 mph winds the fastest yet seen in the solar system. Because the spacecraft photographed at least two and possibly five of the geyser like volcanoes erupting on only a portion of Triton, chances are that there are a dozen of these things going off globally at any time, said Torrence Johnson, a planetary scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. Confirmation of the first active volcano was announced Oct. 2 after scientists analyzed photos Voyager 2 snapped during its Aug. 24 25 flight past Neptune and Triton.

It was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989, and started orbiting Venus on Aug. 10, after a looping 948 million mile voyage from Earth. The spacecraft's radar makes pictures 10 times more detailed than those produced by Earth based radar or radar on the Soviet Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft, which reached Venus in the mid 1980s.

Voyager's pictures of Neptune's moon Triton which revealed a unique world of icy volcanoes might have been washed out if not for last minute adjustments to the spacecraft's cameras, NASA says. It wouldn't have wiped out the mission, but would have made a lot of photographs embarrassingly overexposed, said Rich Terrile, an astronomer at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It would have been an incredible disappointment.

Magellan will be carrying some of the most sophisticated remote mapping sensors ever sent to another planet. An imaging radar system will be able to detect features on the surface as small as 100 yards, about the size of a football field.

The Magellan spacecraft found that 600 mile wide circular features on Venus are mile high volcanic bulges created as molten rock bubbles up from inside the planet, a scientist said Wednesday. From a bird's eye view, the bulges look like nested sets of concentric rings. Called coronas, the rings are ridges and valleys that form huge circles.

Three new moons were discovered around Neptune by cameras on the Voyager 2 space probe as it hurtled toward the blue planet, Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists said Thursday. The discoveries bring the number of known Neptune moons to six, including long known Triton and Nereid and a moon found earlier this summer by Voyager. Voyager 2 was 22 million miles from Neptune when the moons were confirmed by scientists Wednesday, indicating there may be many more discoveries as the space probe draws closer in the next few weeks.

Magellan, a robot spacecraft armed with a sophisticated radar, is ready to rendezvous with Venus and begin an eight month exploration and mapping of the Earth's nearest neighbor, NASA officials said Thursday. The spacecraft is scheduled to complete its 804 million mile voyage to Venus on Aug. 10 when it fires a rocket engine to settle into an orbit that dips to within 170 miles of the planet's surface. Officials said the craft would approach Venus at 24,600 miles per hour and the rocket firing will slow Magellan to 18,400 miles per hour, enough to put it into the planet's orbital grasp.

Tony Spear, the Magellan project manager, said at a news conference that the only major problem experienced by the $413 million spacecraft during its long journey has been an electrical failure in one gyroscope.

NASA's Galileo spacecraft developed camera trouble today after zooming around cloud covered Venus in a celestial billiard shot that speeded the robot explorer toward its 1995 encounter with Jupiter. Although the glitch threatened to prevent Galileo from snapping five dozen more pictures of Venus tonight and next week, project scientist Torrence Johnson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said it should cause no permanent problems for the mission. Mission director Neal Ausman said the TV camera shutter, after taking 16 planned pictures of Venus early today, clicked open and closed 452 times, twice per minute, apparently because of faulty commands from the probe's main computer.

NASA scientists said Sunday they plan to launch the Rolls Royce of spacecraft from a space shuttle Oct. 12, catapulting the ship Galileo to Jupiter so it can parachute a probe into the giant planet's atmosphere. During its looping voyage toward a December 1995 rendezvous with Jupiter, the spacecraft will fly by Venus, pass Earth twice, see parts of the moon not seen since the early 1960s and make the first close approach to an asteroid, the researchers said. The swings past Venus and Earth will catapult the spacecraft to higher speeds so that it can reach Jupiter with the least expenditure of fuel, the researchers said.

While the robot probe is too far from Neptune to detect winds within the spot, the spot seems to be a hurricane like storm system similar to the Great Red Spot, which has 250 mph winds, said Stone, chief scientist of the Voyager project for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Unlike Earth's hurricanes, which break up after a week or two, Jupiter's Great Red Spot has remained intact at least since its discovery more than 350 years ago a mystery scientists have yet to explain.

The absence of continents on giant gas planets such as Jupiter and Neptune may explain the persistence of the spots, Ingersoll said, adding that continents may help dissipate hurricanes on Earth.

An aging Pioneer spacecraft that gave scientists their first close up look at Venus continues to yield secrets of the cloud shrouded planet 10 years after its launch, NASA says. The Pioneer orbiter has revealed many previously unknown features of Venus, whose thick veil of sulfuric acid clouds has kept Earth's telescopes from seeing its 800 degree surface. It challenges our thinking to try to understand why did Venus evolve in such a different fashion than Earth, project scientist Larry Colin said Friday.

And are there any lessons to be learned there in terms of the direction our own climate is evolving? The probe, with some adjustments, should continue to send data until it burns up in the Venusian atmosphere when its fuel runs out in the summer of 1992, said Colin and project manager Richard Fimmel.

While Venus has been called Earth's twin because it is similar in size and density, the planet is inhospitably hot because of what scientists call a runaway greenhouse effect, or overheating caused when the atmosphere trapped solar radiation.

The probe's solar cells, which power the craft and its scientific instruments, are degrading, partly due to a natural process, partly to bombardment by high energy sun particles, Colin said.
