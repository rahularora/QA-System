Six of the 10 richest people in the world are Japanese but the United States still leads the world in the total number of billionaires, according to estimates compiled by Forbes magazine. For the third year running, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi led Forbes' list of private billionaires even though his wealth wasn't quite as much as it had been 12 months earlier. Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, has a personal net worth of at least $15 billion, over $3 billion less than estimated last summer due mainly to a rise in the dollar against other major currencies, Forbes said Sunday.

Being a woman has not made it difficult to govern Pakistan, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto says, but it may have caused some difficulties for her political opponents and Moslem fundamentalists. I don't often think of myself as a woman prime minister, Ms. Bhutto said in a televised interview Sunday with David Frost. I just think of myself as someone who's leading the government, who's got a job to do, not an easy one, and who would like to have the prayers of well wishers everywhere in completing the task in strengthening the rule of law and improving the quality of life for the people of Pakistan.

Bidders at Sunday's 13th Annual Newport Beach Collector Car Auction, one of the nation's largest car auctions, spent $4 million on 400 cars, the most expensive being a 1965 Ford Shelby 350 prototype that sold for $100,000. Miss Turner's 1984 Mercedes Benz 280 GE wagon, which resembles a Jeep, was purchased by an import car dealer in Springfield, Ill., said auction spokeswoman Christine Main.

Iranians involved in the Iran Contra affair thought George Bush was the most powerful man in the world and the person pulling the strings from behind the scenes, according to a new book. The book is written by Michael A. Ledeen, a former consultant to the National Security Council who played a role in the earliest stages of the affair. He says the Iranians overestimated Bush's importance because the vice president was a former director of the CIA, which they considered to be the root of ultimate power in the United States.

Texas Democrats watched in dismay the past several weeks as Republican presidential nominee George Bush pounded rival Michael Dukakis on gun control, crime and the Pledge of Allegiance. But in the wake of vice presidential nominee and Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's debate success, Democrats say the Lone Star state and its third largest Election Day prize of 29 electoral votes once again is up for grabs. I was kind of down in the dumps a couple of weeks ago.

The Mars candy bar clan is worth $12.5 billion, surpassing the Newhouse publishing dynasty as the richest family in America, Fortune magazine reports. If Fortune's estimate is correct, the worth of the Marses could buy about 25 billion regular size Snickers bars, which if laid end to end would circle the planet Mars nearly 32 times. The magazine's calculation is more than any previous estimate of the wealth of the secretive family, which shuns publicity about itself and its candy bar company, maker of Snickers and M&amp;Ms. Mars's assets are often underestimated because the company is as loose with information as its McLean, Va., neighbor, the CIA, Fortune said Wednesday in an advance press release about its 1988 Billionaires List, to be carried in the Sept. 12 issue available on newsstands next Monday.

The Communist Party has changed its name and embraced democratic aspirations, but its members on Monday retained the head of the old party in a compromise vote. Delegates to the closed session said Rezsoe Nyers was chosen as head of the Hungarian Socialist Party's collective presidency after dissatisfied reformers reluctantly agreed to support him. Hours before beginning the closed session, the party congress adopted a manifesto pledging commitment to democracy and a break with the Marxist Leninist orientation of its Communist predecessor.

Two University of California cancer researchers won the Nobel Prize in medicine Monday and immediately reaped the perquisites of success: box seats at the National League baseball playoffs. We're off to the game just got tickets, a jubilant J. Michael Bishop said shortly after he and Harold E. Varmus learned that they had won this year's prize. The 50 member Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute, Sweden's largest and oldest medical university, cited Bishop and Varmus for their discovery that cancer genes in certain viruses are altered forms of normal animal genes.

The 50 member Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute, Sweden's largest and oldest medical university, cited Bishop and Varmus for their discovery that cancer genes in certain viruses are altered forms of normal animal genes. The research helped scientists understand how cancer begins, and it widened our insight into the complicated signal systems which govern the normal growth of cells, the assembly said.

The operator of the Rocky Flats nuclear arms plant knew as early as 1984 that dangerous amounts of radioactive plutonium may have accumulated in building air ducts but failed to act on the information, a former employee said Monday. James Stone, a utility design engineer at the site from 1980 to 1986, said he raised the probability of such plutonium deposits and the safety hazard they would pose with Rockwell International Corp., which operates the plant near Denver under an Energy Department contract. They said we cannot afford to clean it, Stone said in a telephone interview.

They said we cannot afford to clean it, Stone said in a telephone interview. Stone's suspicion of a buildup of plutonium residue in the ventilation system at Rocky Flats was borne out by a team of independent investigators who disclosed in a report to the Energy Department last week that such plutonium deposits raised a real possibility of an accidental nuclear chain reaction at Rocky Flats.

Metromedia Co. Chairman John Werner Kluge is worth an estimated $5.2 billion, but he had to back into first place on Forbes magazine's annual list of the 400 richest Americans. Kluge displaced Sam Walton, head of the Wal Mart stores discount chain, who divided his $9 billion fortune among himself and his four children and ended a four year reign as Forbes's wealthiest person. Among other notables on the list released Monday, developer Donald Trump compounded his already considerable fortune and financiers Michael Milken and Carl Icahn joined the billionaires club.
