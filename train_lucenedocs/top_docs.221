Dexter King's resignation was announced Thursday by the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, but no reason was given. Civil rights leaders in Atlanta said King stepped down because of conflicts over fiscal and personnel concerns, and there were reports of a rift between King and his mother, Coretta Scott King. Atlanta City Councilman Hosea Williams said the center was encroaching on the leadership position in the civil rights movement of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which the elder King founded.

Besides Idaho, only Arizona, Montana and New Hampshire have not adopted state holidays corresponding with the federal holiday honoring King on the third Monday in January. The Idaho Legislature created a state commemorative day in 1987, and a bill creating a state holiday died in a House committee last year despite arguments its failure would only reinforce the perception some have of Idaho as a haven for racists. Opponents said they objected to another day off for government employees.

Jackson joined Coretta Scott King for a news conference outlining events for the city's King Week celebration, which runs Sunday through Jan. 15, Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

Coretta Scott King has asked a judge to skip a trial and immediately decide whether she or Boston University own papers of her slain husband, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. At issue are 83,000 documents now at King's alma mater that range from letters to Eleanor Roosevelt to the outline of his I Have a Dream speech. A sworn statement and documents turned over by the university support allegations that King never donated his papers to BU, Mrs. King claimed in a request for a summary judgment filed last week in Suffolk Superior Court. It's kind of a shortcut in the case, said Archer Smith, Mrs. King's Atlanta attorney, in a telephone interview Wednesday.

The Arizona House of Representatives has approved a state holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., leaving legislators to focus their efforts on the state Senate. The bill, which would designate the third Monday of each January as Martin Luther King Civil Rights Day, passed the House in a 35 24 vote Thursday. Democrat Carolyn Walker, the chief Senate sponsor, said there may be as many as 17 votes for the bill, which needs 16 to pass.

Evan Mecham, who was impeached last spring for attempting to thwart a death threat investigation and misusing funds, drew fire in 1987 for rescinding a holiday honoring King, a move that prompted a boycott of the state by some organizations that had planned to hold conventions in Arizona.

Martin Luther King Jr. borrowed words and ideas extensively from other sources for his doctoral dissertation and other writings without giving proper citations, a Stanford University historian says. Several of King's academic papers, as well as his dissertation, contain numerous appropriated passages that can be defined as plagiarism, historian Clayborne Carson said in a story The Wall Street Journal published today. The slain civil rights leader's widow, Coretta Scott King, chose Carson to lead the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, which she founded in 1984 to gather his papers from locations around the country and produce a multivolume collection.
