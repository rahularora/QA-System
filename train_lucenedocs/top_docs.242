More than 150 years ago, legend has it, Alamo commander William B. Travis drew a line across the grounds of the old Spanish mission. He asked his men to step over it and defend the Alamo against thousands of Mexican troops. Today, the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, who have cared for the Alamo for 84 years, are emulating Travis' legendary gesture as they battle with legislators and Hispanic leaders who want to wrestle control of the Alamo away from the 6,000 member group.

Hispanic and black leaders are urging Austin school officials to name a new high school after someone other than Alamo hero James Bowie, arguing that Bowie was a slave trader. Gary Bledsoe, president of the NAACP's Austin chapter, said Bowie isn't the kind of person whose name should be on a school. The plain and simple truth, according to some of the most noted Texas historians ... is that Jim Bowie smuggled slaves into North America, sold them at vastly inflated prices, owned then, sold fictitious land grants for Texas land, fraudulently sold land owned by his in laws and committed many other heinous and nefarious acts, Bledsoe said.

A $3.5 million offer for a knife believed to have belonged to James Bowie during the battle of the Alamo was withdrawn because the dagger's owner refused to have it tested for authenticity. Spirit of the Alamo, a non profit fund raising group, dropped the offer, president John Stokes said Saturday. Bartley Dean Moore of Riverside, Calif., said family lore has it that a young Mexican soldier found the knife after the mission fell in 1836.

WASHINGTON ON THE BRAZOS, Texas (AP) A question of crass versus class has Texans feuding over whether to hoist a flag and pole 13 stories high at the spot where the state's forefathers declared independence from Mexico in 1836. The 325 foot flagpole would fly a Texas flag one eighth the size of a football field over a local park. The flagpole, which purportedly would be the world's largest, would be about 245 feet shorter than the San Jacinto Monument near Houston, The Dallas Morning News reported.

Tower fielded questions about his confirmation ordeal as Vice President Dan Quayle conceded the Bush admininistration is currently short of the votes needed to ratify the appointment, and as Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell announced his opposition.

The city has other interesting features not least the Alamo, the fort where 189 volunteers died fighting for an independent Texas rather than surrender to the massed ranks of the Mexican army. But it is the river that sets the tone of the place, winding its way through the heart of the city a few feet below street level.

For a US company doing business with Mexico, probably the next best thing to being in Mexico itself is to be in Texas and better still, in San Antonio, the nearest big city to the border. For although Texas is not the only state to share a border with Mexico, it is easily Mexico's biggest trading partner: and if, as Southwestern Bell fervently hopes, the North American Free Trade Agreement is signed, cross border business will boom, to the company's great benefit. According to Mr Michael Wagner, Southwestern Bell's director of investor relations, the third significant factor lying behind the relocation to Texas was a cultural one.

But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell further dampened Tower's chances by declaring his opposition, even as Vice President Dan Quayle conceded the administration still lacks the votes needed for Senate approval. The president said his appeal to senators has been, Look, do what you've got to do, but remember fair play, remember decency and honor and then remember also historically the concept of advise and consent where reasonable doubt is given historically to the president of the United States who after all is responsible for the executive branch of this government. Bush dispatched Quayle to Capitol Hill to lobby for the nomination.
