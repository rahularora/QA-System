Mr. Weiss said the falloff in third quarter profits was due to a variety of factors, including returns of seasonal merchandise that exceeded expectations; a dismal year for the toy industry and, thus, the company's AmToy unit; smaller than expected sales increases, particularly on non greeting card items; and requirements for higher levels of working capital that resulted in increased borrowing and higher interest expense.

Hallmark Cards today agreed to replace a line of greeting cards that had been challenged in a lawsuit by Blue Mountain Arts, a tiny Colorado card company that had accused Hallmark of copying its card design. The consent decree filed in Denver U.S. District Court ends the legal dispute between the two companies that began when Blue Mountain Arts of Boulder filed a $50 million lawsuit in July 1986 against Hallmark. The card war had been scheduled to go to trial Jan. 2 in federal court here.

Clinton Cards added 86 shops to its chain of 277 greeting card and gift stores in a Pounds 3.5m purchase announced yesterday alongside its interim results. The group, which is controlled by the Lewin family, claims that the acquisition from its principal card supplier, Hallmark, the UK arm of the US group, lifts its share of the UK greetings card market from 7.5 per cent to 9 per cent. The acquisition will lead to the closure of more than 12 stores where Hallmark shops compete with Clinton Cards in England and Wales.

The American Jewish Committee and the National Conference of Christians and Jews criticized such mixed cards as an affront to Judaism, to Christianity, and to serious interfaith relations. To combine the religious and cultural symbols of Hannukah and Christmas in greeting card art is to diminish the sacred symbols of each faith, the organizations said Wednesday in a statement released by the AJC.

Russ Berrie &amp; Co., Oakland, N.J., said a federal jury ordered it to pay $4.3 million to a former licensor, which will result in a charge of about $2.5 million, or 17 cents a share.

The jury, in federal court in Illinois, awarded the damages to Georgia Roulo, a former licensor of the toy, trinket and greeting card firm. Ms. Roulo sued Russ Berrie in 1982, contending that the company's line of Touching You greeting cards infringed on the Feeling Sensitive cards she designed for Russ Berrie to sell from 1978 through 1980. Russ Berrie distributed its Touching You cards from 1980 until October 1987, when they were discontinued for reasons unrelated to the suit.
