A hungry bundle of fluff named Molloko, the only California condor chick conceived in captivity, gobbled minced mice Saturday, and keepers of the endangered species were encouraged by its appetite. The newly hatched chick, which raised the condor population to 28, ate its first meal from the fingertips of a handler at 6 a.m. and ate again at hourly intervals, said Martha Baker, spokeswoman for the San Diego Wild Animal Park. The chick was hungry and ate everything it was offered, Ms. Baker said.

A California condor Thursday laid the first egg ever produced in captivity by a pair of the endangered birds, boosting efforts to save the species, the San Diego Wild Animal Park said. If the egg hatches at the end of its two month incubation, it will be the first California condor ever conceived in captivity, officials said. Only 27 of the birds exist, all in captivity, said park spokesman Tom Hanscom.

The egg may not produce an offspring because the female is old and her mate, a young male, may be sexually immature, park officials cautioned. By taking the egg from its parents at an early point, scientists hope to induce the pair to double clutch, or produce a second egg to replace the lost one.

California condors have been decimated in the wild by lead poisoning, caused by eating lead shot in animal carcasses, biologists said.

The hatchings of two healthy California condors late last week and the possibility of eight to 10 chicks in all this breeding season could accelerate the program to return the endangered species to the wild, a zoo official said. A 5.8 ounce bird named Kareya, from the Karok Indian word meaning creator of all things, emerged at 4:30 a.m. Friday, the first of the vulturelike chicks to hatch at the Los Angeles Zoo, said spokeswoman Cindy Richardson. Its gender won't be known for about three months.

Wildlife officials believe the endangered California condor is on the rebound after the hatching of a fourth bird bred in captivity. Kaduku, whose Konkow Indian name means very strong being, both physically and spiritually, became the 31st known condor when it popped out of its shell Sunday at the San Diego Wild Animal Park without much help from keepers. The chick weighed in at 5.8 ounces.

A California condor chick was coaxed from its egg Sunday as keepers clucked over the year's third successful hatching in an ongoing effort to save the giant vulture from extinction. The chick, named Kaduku, was the first conceived by a pair of 6 year old birds at the Los Angeles Zoo, changing biologists' notions about when condors reach sexual maturity, said San Diego Wild Animal Park spokesman Tom Hanscom. It previously was not known if California condors achieved full sexual maturity at age 6 or 7, Hanscom said.

Four Andean condors that will serve as scouts for reintroduction of the gravely threatened California condor into the wild are headed for temporary pens in a rugged mountain range. The 3 and 4 month old avian pioneers, hatched and reared in zoos, will spend several weeks in mesh enclosures as scientists prepare them for their first flights over the dry mountains and foothills that once supported a thriving population of California condors. The California species a black, vulture like carrion eater with a wingspan up to 9{ feet has dwindled to a mere 28, all in captivity.

A California condor chick emerged from its shell Tuesday, marking the fourth captive hatching in the most productive breeding season for the critically endangered bird since 1984, officials said. Named Shasta for the volcanic California mountain that was once a range for North America's largest land bird, the chick was helped out of its shell by keepers at San Diego Wild Animal Park, said park spokesman Tom Hanscom. The egg was removed from its nest at the park's condorminium soon after it was produced April 9 by the parents of Molloko and Mandan, the first and second California condors to be born and bred in captivity.

Since 1983, there have been 14 successful condor hatchings at the Wild Animal Park and the affiliated San Diego Zoo involving eggs taken from the wild. All of those hatchings occurred with human help, although one of those chicks died of an infection 24 hours after birth. The egg was laid March 3 at the park's condorminium after its parents engaged in the first captive mating in the history of a 15 year program aimed at saving North America's largest land bird.

The first California condor conceived in captivity hatched Friday, its keepers using tweezers and their fingertips to help the newest member of the nearly extinct species break free from its shell, officials said. It's alive and it looks healthy, said Tom Hanscom, a spokesman for the San Diego Wild Animal Park. It's resting now.

Condor keepers hobbled the legs of a newly hatched California condor by wrapping them with a tiny gauze bandage in an effort to straighten out the chick's limbs, the San Diego Wild Animal Park said. The bandage was applied to Molloko on Thursday, six days after the hatching of the first captive bred condor, to correct a leg development problem known as splayed legs, park spokesman Tom Hanscom said Friday. Hanscom said the condition is not serious but it could become a hindrance to the bird if allowed to become permanent.

A tiny California condor chick that scientists say represents the salvation of its species pecked a hole in its eggshell today, officials said. Keepers at San Diego Wild Animal Park are keeping a round the clock vigil over the egg, the first produced by captive California condors under a program started 15 years ago to save the nearly extinct species, spokesman Tom Hanscom said.

And has high speed breeding, which nearly doubled the population to 53, yielded enough chicks to risk releasing any in the wild without weakening the limited gene pool? ; Wallace, who took up hang gliding to better understand some of what the kids will face, is unflappable days before the decision: The worst that could happen is we'd wait another year.

Their path toward extinction has been blamed on development of condor habitat and lead poisoning from eating carcasses of animals shot by hunters.

An egg laid in captivity by an endangered California condor last week is probably infertile, the San Diego Wild Animal Park says. The egg was examined Wednesday under a high intensity lamp by the park's lead condor keeper, Don Sterner, said park spokesman Tom Hanscom. He will leave the egg in the incubator for two more days in the off chance that it is simply slow to develop, Hanscom said, but at this point we don't believe the egg to be fertile.

The first California condor egg produced by a captive breeding pair is fertile, and a chick should emerge from the shell in less than two months, San Diego Wild Animal Park officials said today. Fertility of the egg, laid last Thursday, was confirmed this morning when condor keepers briefly held it up to a high intensity lamp and detected a preliminary stage of development, park spokesman Tom Hanscom said. The egg was returned to an incubator, where it will be kept until the expected hatching between April 28 and May 3.

A Boy Scout who crafted a California condor puppet to feed the dying species' first captive bred chick says he won't mind if the project doesn't help him earn scouting's highest rank, Eagle Scout. Jason Schmuckle, 17, of Vista, worked about 20 hours to make the 2 foot long puppet, which has a fiberglass beak and skull covered by deerskin and painted to match the condor's distinctive red and black markings. Condor keepers at the San Diego Wild Animal Park are using Schmuckle's puppet to feed Molloko, the 2 week old chick that was the product of the first captive mating in the history of the critically endangered species.

Removing the egg from the nest stimulates the endangered birds to produce another egg in a month, officials said. In the wild, a condor pair raises a chick once every other year. ; So far this year, five eggs have been laid at the Los Angeles Zoo, and three more have been laid at the San Diego Wild Animal Park.
