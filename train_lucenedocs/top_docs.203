Mothers who take multiple vitamins containing folic acid early in pregnancy are significantly less likely to bear babies with spina bifida and other spinal column defects, a new study concludes. The birth defects were about one fourth as common among babies whose mothers took the over the counter vitamins than among babies whose mothers didn't take vitamins, according to a report in today's Journal of the American Medical Association. The apparent beneficial effect was limited to women who took the vitamins in the first six weeks of pregnancy, leading the researchers to suggest women begin taking vitamins with folic acid when they first start trying to conceive.

Ready to eat cold cereals provide lots of nutrients, and children who eat them tend to be better nourished than those who breakfast on other foods, according to a study of hundreds of 1 to 5 year olds. University of Missouri nutritionist Gretchen Hill said her study shows kids can get a good breakfast on their own by getting the cereal box and some milk. Hill, who presented her study Thursday during the annual meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, said the research didn't suggest that cold cereal was the only good breakfast.

Mothers who take multiple vitamins containing folic acid early in pregnancy are significantly less likely to bear babies with spina bifida and other spinal column defects, a new study concludes. The birth defects were about one fourth as common among babies whose mothers took the over the counter vitamins than among babies whose mothers didn't take vitamins, according to a report in today's Journal of the American Medical Association. The apparent beneficial effect was limited to women who took the vitamins in the first six weeks of pregnancy, leading the researchers to suggest women begin taking vitamins with folic acid when they first start trying to conceive.

We have more reasons to give thanks than we do to be sorry, said Mabel Martin, owner of a trailer park in Alorton in southern Illinois that was devastated by a Nov. 15 storm that caused an estimated $5.3 million in damage.

The U.S. Supreme Court could still make significant changes in abortion law, despite the out of court settlement of one of three key abortion rights cases on its docket this session. The high court is scheduled to hear arguments Wednesday in cases from Ohio and Minnesota, both of which focus on state laws requiring that one or both parents be notified before a minor gets an abortion. Those cases and an Illinois dispute settled out of court earlier this week were seen by those on both sides of the issue as likely vehicles for the Supreme Court to expand or modify its July ruling allowing states greater leeway to restrict abortion.

Discovery's astronauts set their sights on a Sunday landing for a secret military space shuttle mission that sources said included deployment of a spy satellite. Silence has surrounded most of the classified flight, but NASA did interrupt the quiet briefly on Thanksgiving Day to announce that the shuttle was scheduled to land at 7:02 p.m. PST Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. The crew is doing well and the orbiter continues to perform satisfactorily, Mission Control commentator Billie Deason said in the brief status report Thursday evening.

Pregnant women who eat balanced diets don't need extra vitamins and can safely gain more weight than previously believed, according to guidelines released Wednesday by the Institute of Medicine. The guidelines, based on a review of studies on nutrition, weight gain and pregnancy, said the average woman who gains 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy is more apt to produce a healthy, normal weight baby. The study said also that, with few exceptions, vitamins and other food supplements are of no value in pregnancy.

Kellogg has been planning since June to put its Whole Grain Shredded Wheat on the market this month with the claim it's very simply, the most nutritious shredded wheat you can buy. The company contends the shredded wheat has 33 percent more dietary fiber and more thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, iron, vitamins B6 and B12, folic acid, magnesium and zinc with no sugar or salt than the famous shredded wheat manufactured for 89 years by New Jersey based Nabisco Brands, a division of RJR Nabisco.

The researchers at University of Alabama's School of Medicine in Birmingham found in a study of 464 women that those exposed to the virus were five times more likely to have precancerous changes in their cervical cells, or dysplasia, if they also had low levels in their blood of the B vitamin called folate, or folic acid. Such cell changes can be detected with a Pap smear test. Found early, the precancerous cells can be removed, and the risk of cancer eliminated.

Such cell changes can be detected with a Pap smear test. Found early, the precancerous cells can be removed, and the risk of cancer eliminated. Charles E. Butterworth, a professor of nutrition who led the study, said the vitamin deficiency is most often caused by a poor diet, one lacking sufficient amounts of vegetables, fruits and especially orange juice.

Vaccine for Arthritis Shows Promise in Rats AN ARTHRITIS vaccine works in rats, suggesting a new avenue of research on human rheumatoid arthritis. Human rheumatoid arthritis is thought to be an autoimmune disease in which the body mistakenly attacks its own joint cartilage, causing inflammation and destruction of the joints. To study autoimmune arthritis, a team of Dutch and Israeli researchers induced the disease in susceptible laboratory rats by injecting them with a strain of bacteria.

The NRC report provides only a shallow review of the evidence on the benefits of nutritional supplements and fails to reflect the tide of research that supports those benefits, the trade association said in a prepared statement.

For the first time, consumers would be able to tell from a label what their daily intake of the seven substances should be and what one serving of a particular food would furnish. Though there is a growing clamor for such health related information, the food industry hasn't been able to provide so called nutritional profiles because the government has never set recommended daily allowances for those seven nutrients.

They also are sensitive to Mr. Bush's concerns about reregulation tendencies in his administration. Yet to be resolved, administration officials say, is whether the proposed rules will be silent on federal pre emption or whether the FDA will seek public comment on the issue.

A new study suggesting vitamins taken by women helped prevent certain birth defects in their children needs further scrutiny, doctors say. Medical researchers interviewed more than 3,000 mothers and found that those who took vitamins about the time of conception were less likely to have babies with brain and spine defects than other women. But the researchers are unsure whether to credit the vitamins or some other factor, like diet.

Fourteen percent of all the mothers reported taking multivitamins or their equivalent during the entire six month period, and 40 percent reported using no vitamins.

Women who take vitamins before they get pregnant do not reduce the risk of birth defects, a study concludes. The research contradicts earlier reports suggesting that women who take multiple vitamins before they conceive are less likely to have babies with defects of the neural tube, which develops into the brain and spinal cord. We found that vitamin use was associated with neither an increased nor a decreased risk of neural tube defects, wrote the authors of the latest study.

Because it is so cheap, widely available and has few side effects, niacin is one of the first choice cholesterol lowering drugs recommended by the federally backed National Cholesterol Education Program.

Cigarette smokers need more than 1{ times as much vitamin C a day as non smokers, the National Research Council said Monday in revising its nutrient intake recommendations for the first time in nearly a decade. Smoking seems to increase metabolic turnover of the vitamin, leading to lower concentrations in the blood, the NRC said in the 10th edition of its Recommended Dietary Allowances. The new guidelines say that non smokers need 60 milligrams of vitamin C a day and that smokers need at least 100 milligrams.

The recommendation for pregnant women who do not smoke is 70 milligrams a day.

The average American adult can get along on as little as 500 milligrams of salt a day, far less than the usual diet contains, the National Research Council says. Although no optimal range of salt intake has been established, there is no known advantage in consuming large amounts of sodium and clear disadvantages for those susceptible to hypertension, the council said in an update of its nutritional recommendations. The NRC's 10th edition of its Recommended Dietary Allowances, published today, also says cigarette smokers need at least 100 milligrams of vitamin C per day as opposed to 60 milligrams for adult non smokers.

Worldwide, the food industry is devoting some $2.5 billion annually to finding ways to give flavor to low salt products, add sweetness to foods low in sugar, or introduce a rich and creamy fat sensation without using fat.

Nutritional supplements are fast becoming a fad in orthodox medical circles. Doctors who 10 years ago would have been scornful of healthy adults taking vitamin pills, evening primrose or fish oil are today recommending them enthusiastically to protect against cancer, heart disease and other common ailments. A steady stream of clinical trials is showing that food supplements can bring health benefits to a wide range of people and not just to patients suffering from rare nutritional deficits.

At the same time, it may attract more attention from other large pharmaceutical companies looking for a source of safe new drugs.

Food supplements, which began as public health measures, have escalated into an array of additives that some experts say do more to satisfy marketing than nutritional needs. Especially in the battle for the breakfast table Americans spend $5 billion a year on cereal vitamins and minerals have joined the cereal maker's arsenal of eyecatching shapes, crisp sounds and sugar coating. Sometimes there is a risk of giving customers too much of a good thing, illustrated by Kellogg Co.'s recall in August of 29,000 boxes of Frosted Mini Wheats Biscuits cereal with too much Vitamin A.

Supermarket shoppers, unsure what distinguishes lite bread from regular or high fiber cereals from others, may be getting some help from the federal government. Both Congress and the Food and Drug Administration are considering massive revisions in the FDA's nutrition labeling requirements, which date from 1973, when the vitamin and mineral content of foods was consumers' prime concern. Now, much of the focus of healthy eating has shifted to foods' cholesterol, fat and fiber content areas untouched by the current regulations.

Elevated rates of colon cancer in the nation's Northeast and north central region may be due to an acid rain pollutant that absorbs sunlight, impairing the body's ability to make vitamin D, reseachers say. Preliminary studies have suggested that vitamin D and calcium combine to lower the risk of colon cancer. According to the new theory, sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere absorbs ultraviolet rays from the sun that trigger the production of vitamin D in the skin, researchers said at a press conference Tuesday.
