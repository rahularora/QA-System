I'd be more afraid to be run over or mugged in New York than to walk around in the Arctic, Mr. Jesudason says, but he disapproves when guests like Japanese hiker Mitsuro Oba insist on traveling alone.

Native people of the north are preparing to take on the anti fur movement not on the tundra, but in the marketplace. Two native groups in Alaska and Canada plan to seek out small markets to sell native trapped and sewn fur clothing. But animal rights activists contend the embryonic plans are doomed, and promise to oppose the products as much as they do furs from non native trappers and marketers.

A constant parade of Titanic sized icebergs slowly drifts with the currents of Disko Bay in sight of this west coast fishing port. Spawned by the Northern Hemisphere's most productive glacier 25 miles to the south, these mountains of ice break off with a thunderous roar and begin their silent arctic voyage. The barking of sled dogs, which outnumber the 4,000 people of the town, mixes with the chugging of cutters and shrimp boats and the hum of the fish factories in the tiny harbor.

Father Andrezej is the first of the new Polish priests to arrive in the Mackenzie Ft.

That should come as good news to Denmark, which last year provided semi autonomous Greenland with $347 million, or 86 percent of the island's budget.

First published in 1941, Kabloona describes the 15 month, 20,000 mile journey that its author, Frenchman Gontran de Poncins, made to the Eskimo lands near the North Pole. A vicomte and descendant of French essayist Michel Eyquem de Montaigne, Poncins had become disenchanted with the selfishness of our world, the ungenerosity of man to man, and had taken to wandering in places like China, India and the South Seas to see if he could discover any alternative, according to notes that collaborator Lewis Galantiere wrote for the Book of the Month Club edition. ; Search for contentment; Surely of all things in the world the rarest is a civilized man at peace with himself, de Poncins writes with typical candor in the preface to Kabloona, and his trip to the far north was an attempt to see if that barren area could in some way provide the contentment he sought.

The 78 day standoff between Mohawks and authorities in Quebec left ill feelings that may not quickly fade, but one positive offshoot was that it focused attention on the plight of Canada's native tribes, experts said Thursday. After the surrender of the last Mohawk holdouts on Wednesday, federal and provincial governments were congratulating themselves for avoiding major violence, and creating a new program designed to be more sensitive to Indians. Meanwhile, Indians and other observers warn it won't take much for similar situations to erupt again.

There are about 450,000 status, or registered, Indians in Canada and 33,000 Inuit, often called Eskimos. These native people make up 593 bands on 2,234 reserves covering 6.4 million acres.

A strong earthquake struck the Ungava Peninsula of northern Quebec, Baffin Island and the eastern part of the Northwest Territories on Christmas morning, but no damage or injuries were reported. The quake, which occurred at 9:24 a.m. EST, measured 6.2 on the Richter scale, said seismologist Robert North of the Ottawa office of the Geological Survey of Canada. An earthquake over 6 points is a serious earthquake and can cause severe damage in a populated area, North said.

RAE EDZO, Northwest Territories (AP) Two native groups in the Arctic will become the largest non government landholders in North America under a historic agreement signed by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. The long delayed agreement, signed in this tiny community 200 miles south of the Arctic Circle on the shores of Great Slave Lake, will give the Denes and Metis Indian nations nearly 4,000 square miles of land and special rights to an area the size of Oklahoma. Mulroney said the signing marked a day of justice and heralds new economic and political development for the north.

In a landmark decision Tuesday, a judge found four Eskimos innocent of charges of public mischief arising from protests of low level NATO flights over their traditional hunting grounds. I am satisfied that the four believe their ancestors predate any Canadian claims to ancestry on this land, Judge James Igloliorte told a makeshift courtroom set up in the community hall of this Labrador village. Through their knowledge of ancestry and kinship, they have shown that none of their people ever gave away rights to the land to Canada.

Georges Erasmus, president of the Assembly of First Nations which represents all Canadian Indians, urged Dene leaders not to nail themselves to the cross of the federal offer. Anyone too tired to continue fighting for their rights should step down, he said. The assembly called for a meeting with Mulroney and Indian Affairs Minister Bill McKnight to renegotiate areas such as self government, aboriginal title, taxation and water rights.

ANCSA banned the sale of stock to non natives until 1991, but natives realized their corporations would be diluted and their land could slip from their grasp after that.

From the Great Lakes, it would be pumped to the prairies and desert. The estimated cost of construction alone: $100 billion. The same pricetag was put on a 1964 idea proposed by Ralph M. Parsons Ltd., California engineers, to divert the Yukon and McKenzie rivers through the Rocky Mountain Trench of western Canada into the United States.

<P> Question: I inherited a large coin collection along with some dollar bills about five years ago. The collection involves probably 30,000 coins including some junk silver, a lot of rolls of uncirculated pennies from the '60s and many fairly rare pieces, including American and foreign gold and silver dollars. The collection is much too large and valuable to just load up and take to a dealer for evaluation.

The $62 billion James Bay project is the largest hydroelectric development on the planet, cutting roads, building dams, diverting rivers and changing the face of the earth in an area as big as France. For officials of the Hydro Quebec power company, owned by the government of the Province of Quebec, taming the wild rivers of this frigid and practically unpopulated sub Arctic region is the cleanest, most economic and socially acceptable way of meeting the province's growing energy needs into the next century. For the 10,000 Cree Indians whose ancestors lived in the northern Quebec forest here for centuries and who make up one of the earth's last remaining hunter trapper societies, the 15 year old project is disrupting nature, poisoning the fish, ruining traplines and threatening their traditional way of life.

A Soviet American dog sledding team announced plans Tuesday to symbolically break the ice between Siberian and Alaskan Eskimos during a 1,200 mile goodwill trek that will include the first sanctioned crossing of the Bering Strait since 1948. Ten men and two women, comprising six Soviets and six Americans, plan to depart March 1 from Anadyr, Siberia, on a two month journey visiting 30 native settlements along an old Arctic trade route. The expedition is an attempt to call attention to the common cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples of the Bering region, expedition co leader Paul Schurke, 33, of Minneapolis, said at a news conference at the Russian Tea Room in Manhattan.

The outcome of the two week effort to free two California gray whales may never be known as the massive mammals faced 200 miles of ice clogged waters on the way to their winter home. Indeed, the sentiment among rescuers Friday was that ignorance would be bliss if the whales died soon after more than $1 million and countless hours of labor were spent trying to save them. A lot of people just didn't want to know about their fate, said federal marine mammal biologist Jim Harvey.

A lot of people just didn't want to know about their fate, said federal marine mammal biologist Jim Harvey. Rescuers decided against affixing radio transmitters to the animals. That entailed additional expense, and rescue coordinator Ron Morris said little scientific knowledge could be gained from tracking a pair of young, lost whales.

The two whales that captured the world's attention off Alaska should have been eaten instead of freed from the ice, an Eskimo activist says. In my mind, there's something wrong to save these two whales while you are destroying the life of the human beings of the North, Aqqaluk Lynge, of the Greenland office of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, said Friday at a news conference that concluded a three day meeting on arctic cooperation. To my mind it's a degradation of human values, he said.

UNDATED Anti abortion protesters planned pickets and blockades at clinics across the country today after their weekend of demonstrations kicked off with nearly 200 arrests in four states. The New York based Operation Rescue planned demonstrations in 32 U.S. cities and said as many as 5,000 people could be arrested. Today's protests marked a continuation of the anti abortion campaign that has resulted in about 7,000 arrests nationwide in the last five months.

The Reagan administration has rejected a rice industry request for a federal investigation of Japanese barriers to rice imports, averting a political storm in Japan and threatening one in the United States. The decision announced Friday was something of a surprise and was the first important test of the new, tougher 1988 Omnibus Trade Act that was designed to help restore the competitiveness of American goods on foreign markets. Disappointed U.S. rice industry officials condemned the decision and said in a statement that it hoped the new administration to take office in January will be more concerned about promoting U.S. interests than pleasing foreign governments ... Clayton Yeutter, the special trade representative, said in announcing the decision to reject a petition of rice growers and millers that Japan's virtual ban on imported rice was indefensible and intolerable.

Economists are disputing the Reagan administration's contention that the budget deficit's underlying trend is downward despite a small increase for 1988. The Treasury Department and the White House Office of Management and Budget reported Friday that the imbalance between revenues and spending rose to $155.1 billion for the budget year that ended Sept. 30, a $5.4 billion increase over 1987. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, in a joint statement with the OMB, pointed out that several one time events, including the phase in of the new tax law, cut the 1987 deficit and inflated the 1988 budget gap.

The milk of nursing Eskimo women in northern Quebec has a higher level of PCBs than that of women anywhere in the world, according to a university study published today. PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, have been linked to cancer and skin rashes. The 1987 study at Laval University in Ste Foy, Quebec, obtained by the daily Le Devoir newspaper of Montreal, compared 24 samples of milk from Eskimo women in northern Quebec to that of 48 women from southern Quebec, some from an industrial suburb of Quebec City and the rest from Baie Comeau on the shore of the lower St. Lawrence near an aluminum smelter.

It is a prospect full of both promise and threat, one that has divided the state's natives before and now divides them again.

A Dollars 300m zinc refinery might be built in Greenland to process some of the raw material which at present is shipped from the Canadian Arctic to Europe for refining. Substantial quantities of zinc concentrate are produced in the Canadian Arctic and the supply is expected to increase in 1997 with the start up of Metall Mining's Isok Lake project in the Northwest Territories. Greenland's refinery, which would employ about 350 people and be built near the capital, Nuuk, would use cheap electricity from a hydroelectric facility which is nearing completion and will be in full production next year.
