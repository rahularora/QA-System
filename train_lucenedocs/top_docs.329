The connections are vivid in interviews with Mexican immigrants in Los Angeles, and form a unifying theme in a three year study of Hispanic cultural attitudes by Hayes Bautista, head of the Chicano Studies Research Center at the University of California, Los Angeles. ; Although his study did not separate those of Mexican descent from other Hispanic people, Hayes Bautista said he believed that many of the findings about cultural ties could be generalized to include descendants of Puerto Ricans, Cubans or other Hispanic nationalities who predominate in other areas of the country. ; He said attitudes expressed by more than 1,000 participants in his study about language, culture and self identification led him to the conclusion that Hispanic people are evolving into a bilingual, dual culture.

The rebels indicated in the document that the government accepted the refugees 10 years ago to give the world an image of humanitarianism and political opening. Nevertheless, they added, that image is not carried over in its relations with our own poor and exploited people, who suffer the same policies of genocide and ostracism that are practiced against Indian peoples in several Latin American nations. From the beginning of the conflict, Menchu expressed her concern about the possible repression of the rebels and the conflict's repercussions on the Indian and popular organizations of Chiapas.

The bishops' document mentions that, in the event that their proposal is accepted, within the next 48 hours the bishops promise to ask the government to establish an office to handle social problems in the region. The bishops said they have been trying to contact the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, Samuel Ruiz Garcia, since early this morning. Their efforts have failed so far, but they add they can count on the solidarity of this diocese's pastor.

As far as Hispanics are concerned, the word minority is becoming extinct in some parts of the country, although that may not have hit the policy types yet, says Elvira Valenzuela Crocker of the Mexican American National Women's Organization. About two thirds of the Hispanics in the United States live in just three states. California leads with 34 percent, followed by Texas at 21 percent and New York with 10 percent.

Elderly Hispanics suffer more financial hardships and serious health problems than older Americans in general but are less likely to benefit from Social Security and private pensions, a private study shows. The Commission on Elderly People Living Alone said Wednesday its study of America's 1 million older Hispanics shows they generally are not sharing in the economic prosperity enjoyed by other elderly Americans. The commission, established in 1985 by the Commonwealth Fund philanthropic foundation, said the problems confronting Hispanics in later years reflect cumulative deficits throughout life.

There are reports that certain guerrillas captured by the Army have been executed, the bishop said during a news conference. The bishop also said that it is foreseeable the civilian population will be repressed by the Army, because there has not been a delimitation of the battlefields where soldiers are fighting the guerrilla Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN).

Last year when Campbell Soup Co. launched a major assault on the Hispanic market, it used three different ad campaigns on Spanish language television: one aimed at Hispanics of Caribbean origin, another for Mexican Americans, and a third that mixed elements from the other two. Hispanics, clearly, are not an easy group to target. Yet an increasing number of major companies are courting the Hispanic consumer.

The communique emphasized that the authorities have requested the EZLN members, who issued a Declaration of War against the Army and the Mexican Government on Saturday, to put aside their violent and belligerent position against the civilian population and the municipal authorities. A day after the sudden attack by several hundred guerrillas on the Chiapas municipalities of San Cristobal de las Casas, Ocosingo, Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and Chanal, the government said, it is concerned about the prevailing atmosphere in the municipal county seats, which remained occupied by the EZLN.
