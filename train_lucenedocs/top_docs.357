Brazilian officials, vowing not to be pressured by economic interests, have promised to stem the widespread burning of Amazon jungle that already has destroyed an area larger than California. President Jose Sarney has unveiled a plan aimed mainly at stopping uncontrolled forest burning by farmers and ranchers. We must create nationwide consciousness that we are all passengers in the adventure of Man on Earth, Sarney said Wednesday in a ceremony announcing the program.

The program, called Our Nature, calls for a temporary end to government tax and financing benefits for large scale cattle ranching in the northern Amazon and a ban on exports of unprocessed tropical timber. Environmentalists have charged that the clearing of vast Amazon tracts by the primitive slash and burn method has released hundreds of tons of noxious gases into the atmosphere.

Acrid smoke rises two miles high from the slash and burn fires ravaging the Amazon rain forest as peasant farmers and big cattle ranchers alike try to tame the jungle for food and profit. With tens of thousands of square miles of lush green vegetation put to the torch each year, many scientists and environmentalists view it as an ecological disaster, not only destroying the forest but poisoning the earth's atmosphere. The World Bank has estimated that since 1978 this type of land clearing has destroyed 240,000 square miles of rain forest cover, an area larger than California.

One new decree suspends official credits and tax breaks that had encouraged cattle ranchers to turn forest into pasture. The program also includes a zoning study that would put huge forest areas off limits to ranchers, farmers, loggers and miners.

Fire destroyed nearly 50,000 square miles of Amazon rain forest last year, wiping out a section of land roughly the size of Louisiana, according to Brazilian satellite studies released Wednesday. However, Brazil's Space Studies Institute said the amount of forest cleared by farmers and ranchers was not as great as in 1987, when 80,000 square miles were destroyed. Preliminary results of satellite studies showed that 48,400 square miles were set on fire in the Amazon last year, physicist Marcos da Costa Pereira said by phone from the institute in Sao Jose dos Campos, 60 miles northeast of Sao Paulo.

Conservation groups applauded a decision Friday by the international timber industry to promote environment conscious logging in the Amazon jungle, the world's largest tropical rainforest. The U.S. based World Wildlife Fund said the decision the first of its kind by the timber industry could slow destruction of the Amazon rainforest, a key regulator of the world's weather. The International Tropical Timber Organization, an association of 42 producing and consuming countries, approved a $4 million logging and conservation project in the remote jungle state of Acre, on Brazil's border with Bolivia, 2,800 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.

International pressure is mounting on Brazil to preserve its fast disappearing Amazon rain forest, but the debt ridden South American nation continues to resist what it considers to be foreign meddling. There is growing concern worldwide that destruction of the 2 million square mile rain forest, the world's largest and fastest disappearing, could change global weather with potentially disastrous consequences. Satellite photos of the Amazon show that in the past 10 years, an area the size of Belgium has been slashed, burned and mined away.

The government said Wednesday it needs $2.2 billion a year in aid from industrialized countries to stop the destruction of the Amazon, the world's largest wilderness. Science and Technology Secretary Jose Goldemberg said the money would be used to replant deforested areas, relocate settlers and patrol the Amazon to stop slash and burn devastation of the vast jungle. Scientists say slash and burn destruction of Amazon rain forest by ranchers and farmers releases carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and adds to the greenhouse effect, which increases the Earth's temperature.

That is, rural population density is increasing, and farmers are making a living on smaller plots of land because they are using the land more intensively. (This contrasts with the trend in areas where land is being exhausted; here holdings are being consolidated into large and unproductive cattle ranches. ) Over time, this more intensive land use pattern, if it can be sustained, will decrease the unit costs of providing public services, stimulate a more active rural trading system, encourage closer economic ties between rural areas and rapidly expanding urban areas and reduce the strain on the remaining forested areas.

In a quiet, though dramatic, reversal of policy, Brazil is now accepting foreign offers of help to save the Amazon wilderness, the world's largest, from destruction. The government, which early this year rebuffed a United Nations proposal to swap some of its $112 billion foreign debt for investments in Amazon protection programs, recently told Britain and West Germany it would work with them to curb damage, mostly by burning, to the huge rain forest. In August, Brazil accepted Italian and Canadian planes for local authorities to police the jungle.

In the first 11 months of this year, 60 people died most of them poor farm hands and 403 were injured in battles over land, the commission says. Convictions were achieved in only two cases, the international human rights organization Amensty International says.

Removing the tropical rain forest from the Amazon River basin of South America would change forever the climate of that region and could affect the global weather, a new study says. Once the trees are felled, said Jagadish Shukla, a professor of meteorology at the University of Maryland, the famed dense jungle forest along the Amazon River will be gone forever. You will never be able to regenerate the forests once you have cut them, said Shukla, the co author of a study appearing today in the journal Science.

If deforestation were to continue at this rate, most of the Amazonian tropical forests would disappear in 50 to 100 years, Shukla wrote. He said clearing the forest affects the regional climate in three ways: removing the trees causes sunlight to heat up the soil surface; loss of the trees significantly lowers the rate at which water is evaporated into the atmosphere; and loss of the trees disrupts the wind patterns that carry moist air over South America from the oceans.

Marcos da Costa Pereira, a physicist with the space institute, says, The burning of the Amazon is not only poisoning the atmosphere and affecting the earth's ozone layer, it is also reducing the rain forest's capacity to produce oxygen. He says that although it is an exaggeration to call the Amazon the lungs of the world, a phrase often found in press accounts, the Brazilian jungle is a major contributor of the oxygen breathed by mankind. Along BR364, the 900 mile asphalt highway that slices through the jungle to connect Porto Velho to Cuiaba, capital of the state of Mato Grosso, the charred and still smoldering remains of once majestic Brazil nut, rubber and brazilwood trees stand in mute testimony to man's destructiveness.

Sakon points out that Brazil has a very wide range of ports through which 95 percent of Brazil's exports pass. The traffickers take advantage of that to conceal the drug in logs and even in electrical transformers. Moreover, many ships wait outside Brazil's territorial waters for small boats or helicopters to bring them the merchandise, which will then be sold on the U.S. or European market.

In the scarred, denuded hills northwest of Hanoi, Vietnam is waging another war, one scientists say may prove as crucial to its survival as those against the French and Americans. Over large tracts of Vinh Phu, experimental efforts are under way to regenerate forests that once covered most of the hilly province and to persuade farmers to mix cash crops with trees that bind and fertilize the soil. The lessons learned may help attain a national objective: increase tree cover in the next few decades from the current 20 percent to 50 percent.

We are destroying our environmental balance, said Chea Kong of Cambodia's Agricultural Ministry, estimating forest cover has shrunk from 73 to 50 percent in his country over the past decade. Eradication of flooded forests adjacent Cambodia's Tonle Sap lake has wiped out many fish breeding grounds and, in part, accounts for the dramatic drop in catch in recent years.

Mysterious holes that periodically form in the ice covering Antarctic seas may serve as vents for excess heat and trapped gas, helping to shape the Earth's climate and influencing the greenhouse effect. These ice free regions, some as large as France, weren't discovered until 1974 when scientists began examining new satellite images of Antarctica and the frozen ocean encircling it. Scientists don't know if the holes called polynyas existed before then or even how frequently they develop in the vast ice cover.

Because they are the largest group among the dwindling native peoples of the Brazilian Amazon region, the struggle of the Yanomamis has drawn international attention.

The number of fires set in the Amazon rain forest has dropped from last year but the region is still suffering extensive damage, government scientists said Wednesday. They say the burning increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and adds to the greenhouse effect, which causes a global warming. Marcos Pereira, a researcher at the Space Studies Institute, said experts in the past two months detected 59,000 fires that devastated 12,700 square miles of forest an area larger than Maryland.

An Amazonian nature reserve the size of Connecticut could become an important tourist attraction, helping to show Third World countries they can make more money saving forests than logging them, conservationists say. The Tambo Pata Candamo Reserve in a remote, nearly uninhabited Amazon valley has among the highest numbers of rare and exotic birds and animals of any area in the world, said Charles Munn, an ornithologist with Wildlife Conservation International in New York. Set aside as a reserve, the park could help promote ecotourism as a means for Third World nations to profit from their wilderness areas without destroying them, Munn said.

A new study by the Brazilian Space Research Institute shows the entire Amazon rain forest could be wiped out in 50 to 100 years if deforestation continues at the present rate. Carlos Nobre, an engineer and meteorologist with the institute, said Wednesday the findings were the result of a year long study at the University of Maryland using a supercomputer belonging to NASA. Nobre said he used mathematical formulas to project the effects of deforestation, which he estimates destroys 14,000 square miles of rain forest a year.

The chaotic development that is gobbling up the Amazon rain forest could finally be reined in with a new plan developed by officials of Amazon countries and leading scientists from around the world. That's some of the most encouraging news about the Amazon rain forest in recent years, said Thomas Lovejoy, a tropical ecologist at the Smithsonian Institution and an Amazon specialist. It contrasts markedly with a year ago, when there was nothing to read about conservation in the Amazon, especially in Brazil, except bad news, Lovejoy said in a recent interview.

Many of the areas to be preserved will be open to so called multiple use development, which preserves the forest while allowing tourism and the commercial exploitation of fibers, fruits and medicinal plants.
