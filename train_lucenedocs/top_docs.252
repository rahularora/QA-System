And the federal government, for the last 200 and some odd years, has tried very hard to stay out of that process and leave it to the states and local communities, said Richard Church, president of the Plumbing Manufacturers Institute. Church said it would be dangerous to force manufacturers to bring that technology out before it's completely tested, especially for installing the more efficient water closets as the industry still calls toilets in older houses. We're quite concerned that in specific localities there's apt to be severe problems if 1.6 (gallons per flush toilets) are the only ones available, said Church.

Sen. Wyche Fowler's plan to save water by legislating more efficient toilets isn't going down well with plumbers and toilet makers, who contend the public is more concerned with toilet performance than water consumption. Conservation efforts will ultimately fail if proper regard is not given to the reasonable public demand for sound performance standards in water supply and waste disposal, said George Bliss, assistant director of training for the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters. Bliss testified Wednesday at a hearing before the Senate Commerce consumer subcommittee on legislation introduced by Fowler, D Ga., and Rep. Chet Atkins, D Mass., to set national water efficiency standards for toilets and other plumbing fixtures.

The words dog groomer are taboo at their Tara Lara Academy of K 9 Hair Design because the sisters believe that's like saying the Cordon Bleu turns out cooks.

Worried about the state's continuing drought, water districts have been urging residents to install ultralow flush toilets to save water; some districts are even offering rebates to residents who switch. But that has led to another environmental dilemma as the older toilets are dumped into already backed up landfills. So the bureaucrats came up with the idea for toilet bowl reefs.

In a program with national implications, a small California town is requiring contractors to retrofit existing houses with water saving devices before issuing building permits for new houses. Like many U.S. communities, the south central California town of Morro Bay, population 10,000, is chronically short of fresh water because it depends on shallow ground water basins. Its program aims to save as much water in older residences as new houses can be expected to use.

Carl Woestendiek, who manages Seattle's Solid Waste Utility backyard composting program, says size seems less important than putting in the right 50 50 mix of high nitrogen waste, such as grass, and high carbon waste, such as leaves. He adds that a composter the size of a large trash can breaks down yard wastes in 12 to 18 months. But putting in food wastes, he warns, may attract vermin.

<P> The Santa Monica City Council on Tuesday night agreed to impose additional emergency water conservation measures including limiting the watering of lawns to twice a week and encouraging a voluntary 10% reduction in water usage from last year's level with the hope of avoiding water rationing. </P> <P> City officials hope to help residents achieve the 10% cut in water usage by providing free low flow shower heads and faucet aerators for kitchens and bathrooms, free inspections of lawns to determine watering needs, free adjustments to automatic irrigation systems, and free inspections for leaks for customers whose water consumption exceeds last year's use by 20%. </P> <P> The emergency conservation measures, which become effective next week, will be temporary and will continue until the City Council determines that emergency drought conditions have subsided.

Tanner said the charges would be dropped if Amtrak agreed to stop dumping over Rice Creek, a tributary of the St. Johns River, and in the river itself. Black said agreeing to Tanner's conditions would have made Amtrak a target for similar demands from anyone else wanting to stop dumping in any body of water in Florida. Amtrak's passenger cars dispose of sewage either by dumping directly onto the tracks when toilets are flushed or by spraying the contents of 30 gallon holding tanks along the tracks when the trains are traveling at least 35 mph.

The San Francisco plan is one of the state's toughest: If customers exceed their limit twice in a row, the city installs a device that automatically restricts water flow.
 WSJ910423-0218 
In San Francisco, for example, water department officials say the storms have given them enough water to proceed with a plan to impose a 45% rationing plan as of April 1; if it hadn't rained, they might have had to propose even stricter limits. The San Francisco plan is one of the state's toughest: If customers exceed their limit twice in a row, the city installs a device that automatically restricts water flow. If customers go over the limit three consecutive times, the city shuts off their water completely.

Some water officials fear the rains may complicate the fight against drought. The wet weather may erode the sense of urgency they hoped would compel people to skimp on showers, toilet flushing and lawn watering. A lot of people may ask themselves why they have to put up with this Draconian water rationing when their feet are getting soaked as they walk down the street, said Cheryl Davis, manager of customer relations at the San Francisco Water Department, adding, We're concerned they won't take it as seriously as they should.

Amtrak pleaded innocent today to charges stemming from its practice of flushing passenger car toilets and sewage holding tanks into Florida waterways as trains go over bridges. Assistant State Attorney Paul Meredith said the federal railroad agency submitted its pleas to Circuit Judge Robert Perry by facsimile machine. The plea was entered after Amtrak rejected a settlement offer from district state Attorney John Tanner, who promised to drop three charges of commercial dumping if Amtrak would stop all flushing while its trains cross trestles over creeks and rivers.

Pittsburgh braced for a long term water crisis Monday as a slow moving fuel spill snaked down the Allegheny River, threatening supplies to as many as 1 million people. I think it's very possible the worst of this is yet to come, said the city's public safety director, Glenn Cannon. There's no end to it.
