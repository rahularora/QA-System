BFN [Text] Caracas, 30 May (EFE) Today, Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera carried out his first cabinet change, only 117 days after the start of his government and in the mist of a profound economic crisis. Caldera, who assumed the presidency on 2 February, appointed Alberto Poletto, Luis Carlos Palacios, Ciro Zaa, and Carlos Bernandez as ministers of Development, Central Office of Coordination and Planning [Cordiplan], Transport and Communication, and Venezuelan Investment Fund, respectively. Caldera's restructuring of his cabinet has been interpreted by local political experts as a sign that the president is prepared to make a switch to an economic policy less populist than the one he proposed during the elections campaign and closer to the neoliberal policy implemented by former president Carlos Andres Perez.

The well known banker attributed Friday's decrease in the rhythm of the devaluation, from 5 percent to 2.5 percent, to actions that were coordinated by the Central Bank of Venezuela and private banks. This has managed to positively control the dollar's exchange rate which has prevailed since last week.

Velasquez's opinion, that a step backward will be taken in the process of modernizing our economy. This measure is an attempt to halt speculation.
