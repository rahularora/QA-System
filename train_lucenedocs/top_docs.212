Tone is the colors you put together to create a certain hue of sound of a particular instrument the way you play the instrument, the emotion you put behind it, the technique, phrasing, all the things that are elements of your art or your music that create a sound, he said. Johnson chooses to search for tone with more conventional amplifiers and foot pedals from the '60s and '70s that lack the computer chips found in today's equipment. In his live performances, he spreads a buffet of pedals before his feet.

Every day they take away the offerings left near his granite marker the night before: marijuana butts, lighters, guitar picks. Twenty years after Woodstock and 19 years after Hendrix admirers still come to sit and think about the young man who helped define psychedelic rock.

Bass player Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell, the survivors of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, each published books this year. Jimi's death was the most lucrative act of his sad career, according to Redding, whose book is partly a diatribe against the Hendrix estate. The U.S. Army, which counts Hendrix as an alumnus, kicked off the year by including his Voodoo Chile as part of its amplified get out of that refuge concert in Panama for Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.

The anniversary may be a melancholy event for anyone who remembers the first ear boggling encounter with Foxy Lady, Manic Depression or Purple Haze 'Scuse me, while I kiss the sky from the Are You Experienced? LP in 1967. Serious craziness was the Hendrix experience: a stoned banshee swathed in psychedelic foppery, caressing and bullying and battering his guitar; bending The Star Spangled Banner into weird shapes at Woodstock; amazing the plaster casters; fleeing a concert in Denver in a cloud of tear gas; taking too many downers and choking to death on his own vomit.

In 1970, increasing interest in major compositional works brought about the first of many classical collaborations, 200 Motels with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Later joint ventures included three volumes with the London Symphony Orchestra baroque trio recording of the music of Francesco Zappa (circa 1763) and, most importantly, 'The Perfect Stranger' with Pierre Boulez and his ensemble Intercontemporain. But it is the slickly produced and cruelly executed misanthropic rock anthems of the 1970s and '80s for which Zappa is chiefly remembered: songs populated by perverts ('The Detroit Enema Bandit') and Middle American obsessions ('Jesus Thinks You're a Jerk'), with lyrics intoned by a deadpan Zappa and terrifying solos delivered by stunt sidemen in beautifully arranged composition.

As well as these scabrous musical observations, he will also be remembered for a contrary code of ethics which brought him simultaneously into conflict with the US establishment (over censorship), with hippiedom (over his contempt for drug culture), and with Cold War eastern bloc governments (over his funding of alternative art there).

Another gripe: The pre rock pioneers are apparently limited to three inductees a year; this year's were country and western singer/songwriter Hank Williams, swing and rhythm and blues singer and composer Louis Jordan, and T Bone Walker, the bluesman. Last year the nod went to Jimmy Yancey, Jimmy Rodgers and Robert Johnson. There was no reason, save mathematical symmetry, to prevent Gene Krupa, the original rock 'n' roll drummer, guitar solo stylists like Chet Atkins and Wes Montgomery, or bluesman Willie Dixon from getting in sooner rather than later, and long before Mr. Haley and Mr. Nelson.

Danny Ransom spent the first six months of his career tediously making deformed electric guitars for $10 each. Today, he creates near perfect instruments, veritable works of art, that sell for as much as $4,000 to a list of clients that includes some of the world's best known musicians. The average large scale guitar manufacturer can produce one guitar body and a dozen guitar necks in about seven minutes.

<P> Beyond jazz's mainstream and outside the confines of commercial jazz radio, singer and guitarist James Blood Ulmer continues his idiosyncratic explorations. </P> <P> Ulmer, who plays two shows at the Spirit Club in San Diego this Friday night, has often been linked to jazzman Ornette Coleman and rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix. In truth, he's one of the few true originals around.

Ever developing; His own trajectory is proof of the wisdom of that advice. In the '70s, he combined ragtime and the structural grace of Jelly Roll Morton and Scott Joplin with an abstract, free jazz conception in the trio Air (sax, bass and drums). In the '80s he led a septet that included cello, trumpet, trombone and two percussionists.
