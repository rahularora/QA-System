In March a mummy of a young woman, her Mona Lisa smile frozen in a gypsum mask, was found on Giza Plateau a few feet from a roadway through the pyramids. Other discoveries ranged from gold to fortresses, some found on sites once impenetrable except by camel or donkey, now accessible by paved roads.

Artisans are re creating one of the great moments of archaeology on an island south of Cairo. On Nov. 26, 1922, English archaeologist Howard Carter opened the tomb of the boy Pharaoh Tutankhamun and found a glittering world of delicate statues, inlaid chests, feather light fans and decorated coffins of solid gold. The riches he discovered amazed the world.

Workmen cleaning the dusty tomb of Ramses II's beautiful Queen Nefertari found a fragment of beaten gold jewelry that grave robbers and tourists apparently overlooked for 3,250 years. Resins clinging to the etched fragment indicate it may have been attached originally to her missing mummy, Egyptian and American officials said Tuesday in announcing the find. If the fragment is determined to have belonged to the queen, it would be rare indeed.

Rapidly multiplying bacteria are eating away vivid pictures from the walls of King Tut's tomb, one of Egypt's most visited tourist sites. Specialists have begun applying an antidote they hope can arrest the bacteria, but antiquities officials say the original color never can be restored to the small, pox like black specks and blotches marring the walls. The situation inside the tomb is extremely serious, said Mutaw'ie Balboush, the Egyptian Antiquities Organization's director for upper Egypt.

The author of a new book claims the Jewish prophet Moses was known to ancient Egyptians as Ikhnaton, the ruler and religious reformer. I am convinced that I have identified Moses as Ikhnaton, the prophet, poet and king in the 14th century B.C., who shut the temples of the ancient gods, sent the priests home and declared there was only one god, said Ahmed Osman. His book, Moses: Pharaoh of Egypt, was published in Britain on Thursday by Grafton Books.

Fruits, spices and grains entombed with the ancient Egyptian boy king Tutankhamun for his journey to the afterlife have been rediscovered after 56 years in a musty storeroom, a newspaper reported today. The Times of London said an archeological student discovered the boxes of food remains at the Royal Botanical Gardens. The newspaper said the remains have not been disturbed since they were sent to the gardens in 1932 by Howard Carter, who discovered Tutankhamun's tomb in the Valleys of the Kings at Luxor, Egypt, in 1922.

The author of a new book claims the Jewish prophet Moses was known to ancient Egyptians as Ikhnaton, the ruler and religious reformer. I am convinced that I have identified Moses as Ikhnaton, the prophet, poet and king in the 14th century B.C., who shut the temples of the ancient gods, sent the priests home and declared there was only one god, said Ahmed Osman. His book, Moses: Pharaoh of Egypt, was published in Britain on Thursday by Grafton Books.

I am convinced that I have identified Moses as Ikhnaton, the prophet, poet and king in the 14th century B.C., who shut the temples of the ancient gods, sent the priests home and declared there was only one god, said Ahmed Osman. His book, Moses: Pharaoh of Egypt, was published in Britain on Thursday by Grafton Books. The U.S. rights are under negotiation.

Osman's first book in 1987, Stranger in the Valley of Kings, theorized that the mummy of a royal official named Yuya was Joseph, the biblical figure with the coat of many colors who led the tribe of Israel into Egypt.

Excavators have uncovered another 15 statues of ancient royalty and gods from a pit inside Luxor Temple that yielded five magnificent statues earlier this year. The overall find is as significant as the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922, which yielded enormous amounts of gold and other precious objects, said Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. The Tut tomb was wonderful but gave us information only about the art of the day, Tawfik said Tuesday.

Why so long? Probably because he was difficult, litigious and somewhat greedy in short, 'a troublemaker'. Yet this archaeologist, who never received an honour from British royalty and never went to university but was an honorary doctor of Yale, resurrected the 14th century BC teenage king of Egypt with a patience, determination and skill that still leave professionals gasping.

A student rediscovered a forgotten hoard of grain, dried fruit, spices and insects from the 3,300 year old tomb of the Egyptian King Tutankhamun, archaeologists said Thursday. It obviously is extremely important archaelogically because it's a very large amount of material, said John Evans, director of the University of London's Institute of Archaeology. Very little work has been done on material of this period in Egypt, and I understand that some of the species which have been identified are, in fact, the earliest occurrences, Evans said at a news conference.
