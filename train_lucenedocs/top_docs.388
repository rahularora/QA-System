Christopher Columbus could have told them it wouldn't be easy. Ninety Spaniards sailing in exact replicas of Columbus' three ships, the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria, departed from this southwestern Atlantic port Friday on a six month Mediterranean sea trial. But by Saturday, the explorers, who are preparing for a planned 1992 re creation of Columbus' voyage to the New World, found themselves back in port after they were blown to land by a windstorm.

Replicas of the ships that accompanied Christopher Columbus on his Atlantic crossing have set sail, but this time in search of tourist dollars instead of precious metals and spices. The Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria on Friday began their six month voyage to a dozen Spanish ports to prepare for a 1992 re enactment of Columbus' trip to the New World. The ships have a total of 90 crew members and all but the commander, a Spanish navy captain, will sleep outdoors, as Columbus' crew did on the voyage to America.

At the end, the film's effort to maintain an even keel in all political directions finally yields, as the narrator, with some passion, utters the last line: So let us commemorate and yes, celebrate Christopher Columbus. If this portrait is the worst thing to happen to Columbus and his legacy in the months to come, we will have reason to be grateful.

Early last year, these space fans' imaginations were grabbed by a proposal from the Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Commission. To mark the Italian's discovery, the U.S. group suggested, teams from around the world would build and launch in October 1992 a fleet of three small spaceships unlike any ever seen. Once in space, each of these unmanned ships would unfurl thousands of square yards of gossamer sails that would billow out under the almost infinitesimal pressure of sunlight.

Native Americans, Hispanics and Italians have been squabbling over the revisionist view of Columbus as a conquistador and despoiler who can hardly be said to have discovered America.

Still, his achievements were so great that Columbus became a hero in the history of our civilization, and as such he is today the object of much scorn and ridicule from revisionist writers and teachers who believe that children and adults are better served by learning about every fault and blemish of the people they have come to admire. ; By this time next year, we all will have been enlightened by numerous revelations about Columbus' brutal treatment and enslavement of the Arawak Indians he encountered during his four voyages. I am certainly not suggesting that we shield our children from these facts of history or that we tell them only the myths and not the truths about historical heroes like Columbus or George Washington or Martin Luther King.

FIVE HUNDRED years after his fateful voyage to the new world changed the shape of history, Christopher Columbus is still stirring things up. To some, he is the daring and far sighted navigator of legend who brought civilisation and the Christian religion to a new world; to others, a greedy and small minded opportunist whose actions wreaked devastation on a continent. There is no agreement even on what he looked like.

From the storm that threatened Christopher Columbus in 1494 to last year's powerful Gilbert, the death and destruction wrought by hurricanes have been an intimate part of life in America. Good God, what horror and destruction, wrote a 15 year old Alexander Hamilton after experiencing a hurricane in the West Indies in 1772. The roaring of the sea and wind, fiery meteors flying about in the air, the prodigious glare of almost perpetual lightning, the crash of falling houses and the ear piercing shrieks of the distressed were sufficient to strike astonishment into angels, Hamilton reported in a letter to his father.
