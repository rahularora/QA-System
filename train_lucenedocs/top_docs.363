Gen Cedras and Lt Col Michel Francois, the police chief, have said they will not leave office. The effectiveness of earlier attempts at an embargo have been frustrated by hectic trading across the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which share the island of Hispaniola. The Dominican government has said it will reinforce military patrols at the border, but businessmen in Santo Domingo, the capital, said yesterday that this might not be enough to prevent some soldiers and other smugglers from selling petrol and other essentials to the Haitians.

THE PEOPLE Ninety five percent of Haiti's 6 million people are descendants of African slaves brought to the New World to cut sugar cane. A slave revolt led by Francois Dominique Toussaint L'Ouverture led to independence from France on Jan. 1, 1804, making Haiti the first black republic in history. French is the official language, although the majority of Haitians speak Creole.

But the violence at least in the capital, Port au Prince appears to have subsided and a weekend decision to boost the UN presence in the country has raised hopes that Mr Aristide can return safely.

The weekend gun battle is likely to increase the pressure on the Clinton administration to get US troops out of Haiti as quickly as possible. The exiled president, Mr Jean Bertrand Aristide, whom the US wants restored to power, declared yesterday he would call the Haitian parliament into session on Wednesday to consider the plan to grant an amnesty for the military rulers who ousted him. The military rulers agreed to step down when an amnesty is passed, and the exiled president, who is still in the US, clearly hopes to speed their departure.

Haiti's army backed government has declared a state of emergency after the tightening of economic sanctions against the Caribbean nation and amid intensified rumours of impending foreign military intervention to remove the military and reinstate Mr Jean Bertrand Aristide, the exiled president. The announcement of the emergency by Mr Emile Jonassaint, recently appointed head of the government by the army, coincided with an attempt by several thousand Haitians and hundreds of foreigners to leave the country before the termination of commercial flights, one of several new sanctions against Haiti, takes effect. The US and Canada say they will end commercial flights to Haiti on June 25 to increase pressure on the military rulers who took power in a coup 30 months ago.

Fuel prices jumped from about 110 gourdes (about Dollars 8.50 or Pounds 5.80) a gallon to 135 gourdes since the blaze on Saturday night, according to checks at several sales outlets yesterday. Tens of thousands of gallons of fuel increasingly precious in Haiti since the imposition of the UN embargo in October were destroyed in the blaze that gutted a half block of Rue de Cesars in downtown Port au Prince.

PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti (AP) Critics said Saturday that Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy's decision to discard the constitution approved 15 months ago demonstrates that the army has no intention of returning the country to democracy. The army is sick of this talk of democracy. The truth is they don't want elections, said Paul Latortue, a former senatorial candidate in Haiti who lives in exile in Puerto Rico.

Lt Gen Raoul Cedras, head of the military government in Haiti, resigned his post yesterday and announced he was leaving the country, thus facilitating the return of the man he overthrew in a bloody 1991 coup, President Jean Bertrand Aristide. Mr Aristide's supporters immediately took to the streets of the capital, Port au Prince, to celebrate, forcing the US military to protect Gen Cedras and his family, as well as Gen Jean Claude Duperval, who was appointed interim head of the Haitian military yesterday. At a public ceremony on the steps of military headquarters, Gen Cedras attempted to leave power in a dignified manner, handing over nominal control of the armed forces and police to Gen Duperval, his second in command, as a 40 piece military band played the battle anthem of Haiti's armed forces.

The general's authority over the military, and the military's reign of terror over the population, had been steadily declining over the past week as it became apparent that he had no future as commander. Pro Aristide demonstrations throughout the country have become widespread, often with deadly consequences for the president's supporters. On Friday in the town of St Marc, about 75km north of the capital, at least 10 people died and scores were injured as a bus ploughed into a pro Aristide rally.

Over the next few days, US forces will be under pressure to protect both pro Aristide rallies, sure to increase as the population prepares for the return of its president, and members of the Haitian military, which is in disarray but under unusual orders not to fire on Haitians.

Among those Namphy attempted to transfer was Col. Jean Claude Paul, who was indicted for drug trafficking earlier this year by a grand jury in Miami. Manigat, apparently siding with Paul, said the order was unconstitutional because it was done without consulting him. The dismissal of Namphy seems to have enforced Manigat's authority, said Sylvio Claude, leader of the opposition Christian Democratic Party.
