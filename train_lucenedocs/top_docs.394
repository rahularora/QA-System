The world's largest dictionary of the English language will be published five months from now and everyone who is interested will want to have one if they can pick it up. The second edition of The Oxford English Dictionary known to word buffs as the OED will have 22,000 pages, fill 20 volumes, weigh 137 pounds (62.5 kg) and be priced at about $2,500. We are sure we will sell a lot because the dictionary is the standard work of reference on the English language and any substantial library will have to have it, said Ludo Craddock, promotions executive of the Oxford University Press.

IMAGES OF ENGLISH by Richard W. Bailey Cambridge Pounds 16.95, 329 pages I ONCE saw a notice in a London bus explaining scheduling changes which concluded with the words, 'So the buses run smoother, and there are less delays'. To purists this sentence is a ghastly example of the quasi illiteracy which besets our culture. To the more liberal minded, it is an example of desirable simplification in the direction of demotic forms.

A 15 year campaign to promote Filipino as the national language has stirred controversy in the Philippines where more than 80 languages and dialects are spoken. In 1973, when he was president, Ferdinand E. Marcos mandated a policy of using English and Filipino, a Malay language based on the Tagalog dialect, in elementary and high schools. English had been used exclusively in schools since the United States took control of the Philippines from Spain in 1899 and is still widely spoken by the educated elite.

The 5,000 new words in the second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary say more about the glacial pace of lexicography than about the age of the words. There are freshly minted terms such as AIDS related, antiquark, fax, Filofax and ghetto blaster; words or word senses redolent of the 1960s such as acid, downer, grok and chopper, and jazz age coinages such as Big Apple. There's even one new word from Anglo Saxon: ash, the symbol that combines the letters A and E. The second edition, to be published March 29, reflects more than a century of scholarly labor.

If W3 struck many of us as an ignoble retreat from this ideal in favor of slack standards and terms too new to belong in a dictionary then The Random House Dictionary of the English Language in its first edition (1966, RD1) tried to satisfy both camps, the moldy figs and those who wanted to cast off the fig leaves of lexical modesty. Now we have RD2 (2,500 pages, $79.95). It is bigger (more than 50,000 new entries) and conceptually better.

A hyphen also is expected to help avoid confusion, ambiguity, absurdity, even insult.

In fact, I would go as far as to say that the amount of this vile talk is detrimental to our language as a whole, for it perverts the very fabric that makes up the English language. By this I mean that the use of obscenities is almost always used in place of a more appropriate word that is not obscene and is better fitting.

But not in this campaign. A new word gets into Webster's simply by being used repeatedly in newspapers, magazines and other contemporary writing. Lowe's staff spends most of its time reading and noting new words and new uses on citation cards, and when a term builds up sufficient citations over an extended period of time, it is added to the dictionary.

THE SUCCESS of Cambridge mathematician Alan Turing as a code breaker is one of the legends of the second world war. Around 1944, when the German naval codes had all been cracked decisively by the government code and cypher school at Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, Turing had (in the words of his biographer, Andrew Hodges) 'learned how to build a brain not an electric brain, as he might possibly have imagined before the war, but an electronic brain. ' If Turing were alive today the harsh English law against homosexual men led to his untimely death in 1954 he would surely take a well deserved pride in the universal labour saving which the electronic brain he and other pioneers conceived plays in all our lives.

Heather Hardy, an associate professor of English at the University of North Texas, began the project after receiving a newspaper clipping in 1980 about an Alabama tribe member who was using note cards to create a dictionary of her native language.

The Bible is one of the main tools of the Christian church but tools get blunt and the edges need resharpening. Knowledge increases as the years go by, language changes and style alters, he said. The new Bible, officially published Sept. 28 but already on sale, will be used immediately in Protestant churches but still needs the imprimatur license to publish of Catholic authorities before their congregations can use it, Coleman said.

Britain's army of civil servants got new marching orders Wednesday: use plain English. Citing such authorities as Confucius and Winnie the Pooh, a Cabinet Office pamphlet appealed to the bureaucrats to be clear and concise in talking to the public and to each other. Britain's 500,000 member civil service has never been known for using a word when three would do, as the pamphlet notes in citing this 18th century note from the Commissioners of Excise to the Supervisor of Pontefract: I am ordered to acquaint you that if you hereafter continue that affected and schoolboy way of writing, and to murder the language in such a manner, you will be discharged for a fool.

Loll Rollings, chief of the EC's multilingual program, says fighting the balkiness of EC translators has been hard: They say: 'We get our salary whether we produce six pages a day by human translation or whether we produce 25 by machine,' he contends. On their side, translators say that while the machines may be all right for translating the language of bureaucracy, they don't do well when used on more active prose. Oratory is out because it is on the warm end of the emotional scale, says Andrew Evans of the EC's English translation division.

Working on short, terse sentences Mason recommends training the authors to write text with translation in mind the results can be extremely effective. A human translator using a batch system could translate between 5,000 and 10,000 words a day. Most of the manual work would be at the 'post editing' phase, once the machine had completed its task.

What we have here is a quirk of language: Pronunciation changes, but not spelling. Pronunciation is the ultimate democratic enterprise; it can't be controlled by government fiat or by rich snobs who talk as though they have lockjaw. If enough people say the word harass with the accent on the second syllable, instead of as a homonym of Harris, then that must be acknowledged as an acceptable pronunciation if not the standard pronunciation.
