BFN [Text] Head of Government Roch Marc Christian Kabore on 9 April publicly announced the counter proposals made by the labor unions in response to the government's 5 April proposals. The issue that has set a lot of tongues wagging is certainly that of salary increase, heightened by rumors of a hypothetical 15 percent increase said to have been authorized by the World Bank and the IMF. This has once again sparked off the debate over whether or not to believe the government, which has been telling the whole world that budgetary constraints resulting from the structural adjustment program do not enable it to significantly increase salaries.

In an unusual broadening of their role into social and cultural issues, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have won a commitment from the government of Burkina Faso to take steps to combat female genital mutilation. The commitment is included in Burkina Faso's policy framework paper, a set of medium term economic policy priorities negotiated with the international financial institutions as the basis for receiving assistance loans. The practice of female genital mutilation, sometimes referred to as female circumcision, is widespread in many countries of sub Saharan Africa.

In a special supplement on the papal trip, the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano decried the world's indifference towards Africa's problems. While the eyes of the world are still fixed on the extraordinary events of Eastern Europe, the heart of the church now looks elsewhere ... to the vast territory of suffering that is Africa, the newspaper said. A centerpiece of the pope's trip will be a ceremony Monday in Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso, marking the 10th anniversary of John Paul's appeal for the Sahel in which he declared: I can not remain silent while my brothers and sisters are in danger.

Pope John Paul II told Roman Catholics today to resist abortion and contraception as they try to improve living conditions in this impoverished West African country. Celebrating Mass outside the capital at a national pilgrimage site, the pope said the church and its members should work to build up the country on the basis of respect for the human person and the family. Human life is inviolable, the right to life should be defended ceaselessly, John Paul said.
