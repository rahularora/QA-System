The anger over Salman Rushdie and his novel The Satanic Verses is quick to flare and shared by many in London's Moslem community, from the sweetmeats shopkeeper to the Bangladeshi banker. But while they spare no insult for the author they accuse of blasphemy, many in the city's narrow East End streets don't seek vengeance and reject Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order to execute him. The Imams and Mosque council in Britain issued an appeal to all imams Moslem clergymen to respect British law.

Salman Rushdie said Monday that he has embraced Islam and has given up his push for paperback publication of The Satanic Verses, the book which brought him a death sentence from Iran nearly two years ago. He also pledged, in a statement released by a local Islamic leader, that he would permit no further translations of the book.

Moslems worldwide objected to Rushdie's use of the names of the Prophet Mohammed's wives for the prostitutes in his novel and the implication that Mohammed wrote the Koran, Islam's holy book, instead of receiving it from God. In September 1989, a trade survey found booksellers in England divided on the question of stocking any paperback edition. Forty percent said they would not handle it, 44 percent said they would, according to Publishing News.

Salman Rushdie said today the furor caused by his book The Satanic Verses shows Moslem fundamentalist leaders in a bad light and makes him wish he had been more critical. Frankly, I wish I had written a more critical book, he told CBS This Morning. I mean, a religion that claims, that is able to behave like this; religious leaders, let's say, who are able to behave like this, and then say that this is a religion which must be above any kind of whisper or criticism, that doesn't add up.

Lyrical, scathing, inquisitive and at times bewildering, the novel deals with preconceptions of good and evil, Britain's treatment of illegal aliens, the desire by Indians to become assimilated into British culture and, most notably, the birth of the Islamic faith. Rushdie, a 41 year old Bombay native of Moslem parents, writes in a stream of consciousness style that leaves the reader alternately exhilarated, bewildered and depending on one's religious and political orientation outraged. The novel has been condemned by Moslems for its dream sequences that portray the prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, a coward willing to compromise his faith for general acceptance and a conniving businessman who makes up laws to suit his own purposes.

The new book is scheduled for release next April by Penguin, which also published the Rushdie novel in 1988, setting off worldwide protests, riots, diplomatic standoffs and debates on freedom of expression.

Bradford's Moslems invited Eric Pickles, leader of the city council, to a public burning of The Satanic Verses and were surprised when he refused. The incident illustrates the gap Salman Rushdie's novel opened between Western Europe and its minority Moslems between men like Sher Azam, spiritual leader of Bradford's 60,000 Moslems, and Pickles, the Anglo Saxon businessman to whom he extended the invitation. Azam, born in Pakistan 48 years ago, was equally offended by British outrage at the book burning.

Lyrical, scathing, inquisitive and, at times, bewildering, the novel's subjects include society's preconceptions of good and evil, the British treatment of illegal aliens, the desire by Indians to become assimilated in British culture and, most notably, the birth of the Islamic faith. Rushdie, a 41 year old native of Bombay, India, who now lives in London, writes in a stream of consciousness style that leaves the reader alternately exhilirated, bewildered and depending on one's religious and political orientation outraged. The book opens with the bombing of a jumbo jet by terrorists.

In 1649 Oliver Cromwell, subduing Catholic Ireland, quartered his army in Youghal and was greeted by the prudent townsfolk with the same enthusiasm with which they subsequently welcomed the return to the throne of Charles II. When I was growing up the Protestant congregation was sparse, mustering under a hundred even at Christmas, in a place that could hold over a thousand.

Pro Iranian kidnappers of three Americans issued a statement Thursday vowing revenge on author Salman Rushdie and his publishers for insulting Islam, but did not threaten harm to the captives. The kidnappers, who call themselves Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, made the threat in an Arabic language statement delivered to a Western news agency with a photograph of hostages Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse Turner. They pledged revenge on all those who took part in strong and ferocious campaigns against Islam ... all institutions and organizations that insulted in one way or another the prophet Mohammed and his family through Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses.

Britain's ancient blasphemy laws will not be changed because it would be difficult and could damage relations among religious groups, the Home Office Minister John Patten said in a letter to Moslem leaders on Tuesday. Patten also reiterated the government's lack of authority to ban Salman Rushdie's novel, The Satanic Verses, which many Moslems believe blasphemes Islam. He stressed the British author's right to freedom of expression.

Sheik Mohammed Hossam el Din, a leading Islamic theologian in Cairo, said Khomeini erred in sending death squads after Rushdie because executing him would be virtually impossible under the tenets of Islam. Hossam el Din said in an interview that nobody has been executed in Islam's 1,350 year history as an apostate, which he interpreted as the crime that Khomeini invoked in issuing his sentence against Rushdie. Khomeini said only that the Indian born author deserved to die for insulting Islam.

Iran's parliament speaker said Friday The Satanic Verses had created history's strangest crisis, and he offered a simple solution: Burn all existing copies of the book and ban it forever. A dispatch from the official Iranian news agency did not say whether Hashemi Rafsanjani commented on Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order of Feb. 14 that his followers kill the author, Salman Rushdie, for blaspheming Islam. Unless the novel is destroyed and banned, Rafsanjani said during Friday prayers at Tehran University, it will remain forever a source of rebellion and it would be impossible that peace would come between real Moslems and the supporters of this book.

Rushdie apologized after his book was banned in six countries and removed from the shelves of major bookstores in the United States. The author's statement came a day after Iran's president, Ali Khamenei, said the Indian born Briton could save his life with an apology. Iran's news agency noted the apology but said Rushdie's statement made no indication of his repentence or that his slanderous book would be withdrawn.

Salman Rushdie has been in hiding for 10 days under a death sentence from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, but he has fulfilled at least one literary commitment: a review of fellow novelist Philip Roth's autobiography. In the review for the weekly Observer newspaper, Rushdie is said to hint at a feeling of kinship with the American Jewish author, whose portrayals of his fellow Jews got him into trouble. In the course of reviewing Roth, who himself had a period when he was vilified by the Jews, he (Rushdie) says he found Roth was not just speaking to him but for him, Blake Morrison, the literary editor who commissioned the article, told The Associated Press Thursday.

Roth was attacked in the 1960s for his irreverent, painfully personal descriptions of Jewish life, especially in his novel Portnoy's Complaint.

A leading writer on Islamic militancy said Thursday that the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order to assassinate Salman Rushdie, author of the novel Satanic Verses, had nothing to do with revulsion over the contents of the book. Robin Wright, herself once the target of a Mideast death threat, said that Khomeini, seizing upon the growing fury among Sunni and Shiite Moslems over the book, issued the edict against Rushdie in a bid to gain the leadership of the entire Islamic world. Ms. Wright, author Sacred Rage: the Wrath of Militant Islam, and the upcoming In the Name of God: Khomeini's Revolutionary Decade, said Khomeini also was using the issue to divert attention from domestic problems, just as he created the U.S. hostage crisis in 1979 to mobilize public support for his troubled regime.
