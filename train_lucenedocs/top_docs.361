A swarm of microearthquakes and discovery of a possible underground pool of molten rock provide hints that California's dormant Medicine Lake Volcano might be reawakening, scientists said Friday. However, there is no evidence an eruption is likely, U.S. Geological Survey scientists said. It's suspicious enough to put in a new network (of seismic monitors) but not suspicious enough to cause alarm, said John R. Evans, a seismologist at the agency's western regional headquarters.

The quakes may have recorded the intrusion of new magma into this part of the volcano, Evans, Iyer and Dawson said in a study presented at their agency's Geohazards '88 symposium The possible magma pool is small, measuring only about two cubic miles, compared with a volume of about 200 cubic miles for the magma chamber believed to be beneath the Long Valley caldera near Mammoth Lakes, Calif., Evans said.

Eight years after a volcano scare incited fear, anger and economic gloom in Sierra resorts, residents are nonchalant about renewed underground lava movement that is triggering thousands of tiny earthquakes. Scientists say there is a very small chance of a volcanic eruption. But most of the quakes are too small to be felt, so you don't really think about it, said Pam Murphy, spokeswoman for Mammoth Mountain Ski Area.

Molten rock moving beneath California's Mammoth Mountain ski resort triggered thousands of small earthquakes since May, but the U.S. Geological Survey says the old volcano is unlikely to erupt. We still see occasional bursts of quake activity, but it's much more sporadic in recent weeks than in June, when hundreds of tiny jolts each day rattled the 11,053 foot mountain in the Sierra Nevada, said USGS geophysicist Dave Hill, the scientist in charge of monitoring the situation. In a statement issued Monday, the federal agency said: While eruptive activity as a consequence of this current earthquake swarm cannot be ruled out, observations at many volcanoes in the world suggest the most likely outcome ... is a return to an extended period of relative quiescence.

Some of the quakes were only 1.5 miles deep and often came in rapid fire bursts. Mammoth Mountain has bulged upward about one half inch since May, Hill said. The most likely explanation for the quakes and bulging is that molten rock, or magma, is being squeezed into a vertical crack that extends from 3.5 miles to 6 miles below Mammoth Mountain's south flank, he said.

At 4.1 on the Richter scale, the earthquake on the afternoon of March 20, 1980, was no great shakes. It knocked snow off the north face of Mount St. Helens but went virtually unnoticed in the surrounding counties of southwestern Washington. Nearly 130 miles to the north, the line traced by a wandering pencil on a seismograph at the University of Washington was first interpreted as evidence of a tremor 75 miles southeast of the dormant volcano.

A giant ash plume belched from Mount St. Helens, but scientists said it didn't appear to portend a new eruption of molten rock. Wind carred the ash toward Portland, Ore., 53 miles to the southwest, prompting United Airlines to cancel 21 flights in and out of that city Thursday night. Normal service was to resume this morning, United customer service supervisor Fred Von Pegert said.

Bad weather again prevented flights over the mountain, said Cliff Hall, an operations staffer with the Cascade Volcano Observatory. We're unable to look at what's happened because of the rain and wind and clouds, Hall said. Scientists speculated that steam emissions seen coming from the volcano were caused by groundwater reaching superheated rock beneath the volcano and turning to steam, or from gas released by cooling molten rock.

Voyager 2 found Neptune's moon Triton to be a world in which volcanoes blast nitrogen ice 20 miles skyward and where giant craters once overflowed with ocean size floods of frozen lava, scientists believe. If scientists are correct in their interpretation of Voyager's photographs, Triton is only the third object in the universe where active volcanoes have been identified. It's one of the most interesting and provocative worlds in the solar system, says Charles Kohlhase, Voyager spacecraft mission design manager at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Mount St Helens in Washington state wiped out thousands of acres of productive timberland. Losses from interrupted economic activity are harder to quantify, but may be more devastating.

Mount St. Helens is approaching a landmark of sorts: two full years without any new blasts of smoke and ash, or even burps of lava. The last eruptive episode occurred Oct. 21 24, 1986, when the southwest Washington volcano added a new lobe to the top of the lava dome that sits in its gaping crater. The dome remains dwarfed by the cavernous crater, even though it has built to a height of 875 feet above the crater floor.

Voyager 2's close up photos of Neptune's moon Triton reveal what look like active ice volcanoes that erupt explosively, spewing nitrogen ice particles and gas nearly 20 miles high, scientists said Sunday. I believe they are active, or erupted at least within the past 100 years, said U.S. Geological Survey geologist Larry Soderblom, a member of the Voyager photographic imaging team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. There's 10 or 20 or 30 lots.

Dymond and Collier said nothing they have found so far could settle the question of whether drilling for hydrothermal energy more than seven miles away would affect the lake. California Energy Co. geologist Joe LaFleur said if hot springs do exist, they wouldn't be affected by the drilling. Crater Lake was formed after rain and melted snow filled a crater, called a caldera, formed when the Mount Mazama volcano erupted nearly 7,000 years ago and then collapsed into what had been a chamber filled with molten rock.

People living near a volcano in northern Japan that came to life last month for the first time in 26 years are bracing themselves for another powerful eruption. Scientists studying the volcano said Wednesday there were signs another major eruption was developing. Based on the volume of magma that exists there may be a major, powerful eruption to match those that occurred in 1926 and 1962, said Yoshio Fujii, professor on volcanology and petrology at Hokkaido University.

The Magellan spacecraft has found evidence that ocean sized floods of molten rock once inundated more than half the surface of Venus. NASA scientists said they don't yet know if there was one great outpouring of lava from cracks in Venus or a series of smaller flows, each hundreds of thousands of square miles, that engulfed parts of Venus at different times. The scientists at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported the findings Wednesday.

Saunders said he began to suspect Venus was subject to such catastrophic volcanic activity because Magellan's pictures of Venus show the planet has fewer large meteorite impact craters than Earth's moon, and because the ones we find are all relatively fresh.

Saunders said he began to suspect Venus was subject to such catastrophic volcanic activity because Magellan's pictures of Venus show the planet has fewer large meteorite impact craters than Earth's moon, and because the ones we find are all relatively fresh. That suggests there's a process of very widespread volcanism that occurs from time to time that destroys all the craters and everything else, he said.

He said some dogs were also afflicted with coughing and trembling due to excessive fear. My busiest day was July 14, the day after the eruption, Mochizuki said. Symptoms in animals appeared earlier than in people because animals are more sensitive, and they feel the temblors and noises more strongly.

An underwater volcano erupted Thursday off central Japan, spewing plumes of smoke and ash into the air and creating tremors that shook the Izu peninsula. There were no reports of injuries or damage, but callers jammed telephone lines for hours after the eruption a mile off the coast of Ito city, a seaside resort 62 miles southwest of Tokyo. Hundreds of Ito's 72,000 residents fled, and city officials were considering evacuating people living near the shore, according to the Japan Broadcasting Corp.
