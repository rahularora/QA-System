The nation grew to 249.6 million people in the 1980s as more Americans left the industrial and agricultural heartlands for the South and West. The Census Bureau's first final figures from the 1990 census, released Wednesday, showed the pull of the Sun Belt remained strong, despite efforts by the industrial North to promote growth and the collapse during the 1980s of the oil and savings and loan industries two mainstays of the Southern and Western states. The census figures are used to adjust the number of representatives each state sends to Congress so that political clout is in line with population.

More Americans are once again calling the Midwest their home, but Sunbelt states like California and Florida remain the favored places to settle down, government figures show. The Census Bureau on Thursday released its 1988 population estimates, showing that the West and parts of the South continued strong population growth, while smaller growth rates were reflected in the Northeast. The Midwest appeared to be rebounding after a dropoff in population during the early part of the decade.

The U.S. population stood at 249,632,692 as of the 1990 census, the government said Wednesday in a numerical portrait of a nation growing far more rapidly in the Sun Belt than in the industrial north and agricultural heartland. California, the nation's largest state, added more than 6 million people in the decade, a 26.1 percent increase to 29,839,250 people. Wyoming remained the smallest state, with 455,975 people, down 2.9 percent from 1980.

ADD ALASKA to the short list of states losing population. The reason: a sharp increase in the number of residents moving out. In the early 1980s, a healthy influx of newcomers, plus the highest natural population increase of any state (about six babies are born in Alaska for every person that dies), kept population moving up briskly.

RACIAL differences in the timing of first births are widening, two University of Pennsylvania demographers find. Drawing on birth and other records published since 1979, Renbao Chen and S. Philip Morgan determine that from 1980 to 1987 white women under 30 years old continued an earlier trend toward postponing their first birth, while white women over 30 began showing slightly higher rates of first births than over 30 women of earlier decades, clearly seeking to catch up on postponed fertility. Nonwhite women blacks, Asians and others also tended to have their first children at somewhat later ages than nonwhite women in earlier years.

But at every age from the teens on, blacks and other nonwhites were far more likely to be having their first birth than were white women of the same age. For example, in 1987 a 20 year old nonwhite woman was almost twice as likely to have her first child in the following year as was a 20 year old white woman, while a 25 year old nonwhite woman was about 1 1/2 times more likely to be having her first child than her white counterpart.

Census Bureau Sees Slow U.S. Growth Ahead ACCORDING TO projections published today by the Census Bureau, there will be nearly 250 million people in the U.S. by 1990, up 23.3 million from 1980. If the 1990 census proves these figures correct, the U.S. population will have grown by only 10.3% this decade, the lowest rate in U.S. history except for the Depression years of the 1930s, when it was 7.2%. The projections also indicate record low growth in the near future: 7.2% in the 1990s and 5.3% between 2000 and 2010.

Census Bureau figures released today indicate that seven states are likely to gain seats in the U.S. House of Representatives in reapportionment, while as many as a dozen states will lose at least one seat, forecasters say. The next reapportionment will be based on the final 1990 Census figures, which will be collected in the 10 year census next year. The state population figures released today go up to mid 1989 and represent one last checkpoint before the final, official count.

Florida eclipsed Illinois to become the nation's fifth most populous state during the year ended July 1, the Census Bureau estimated. Florida's steady population gains have moved it from 10th place since 1960. Texas is the only other state among the 10 biggest to move up significantly in the past 26 years; it rose to third from sixth place in 1960, the census agency said.

Much of the GI generation that fought in World War II and returned home to create an economic and baby boom is retiring in relative comfort, a Florida researcher reports. More than half of retirees age 65 to 74 have income at double the poverty level, and 12 percent form an elite with income from at least three sources, according to Charles F. Longino of the University of Miami. But elderly affluence isn't spread evenly across the nation, Longino reports in the June edition of American Demographics magazine.

The Census figures on state population, issued for release Friday, showed Nevadawith the biggest population gain at 18 percent from 1985 to the middle of 1989. Arizona had the second highest growth rate, at 12 percent, followed by Florida and New Hampshire at 11 percent and California at 10 percent. Seven states lost population during the same period, the bureau said: Iowa, North Dakota, Montana, West Virginia, Wyoming, Louisiana and Oklahoma.

The findings are based on two Census Bureau projects: a post enumeration survey conducted in selected areas after the 1990 census and a demographic analysis of state, local and federal administrative records. The census count for 1990 is 248,709,873 nationwide. According to the post enumeration figures, however, the census count should be somewhere between 252,982,000 and 254,989,000.

One year's statistic doesn't always portend a trend, and young adults are still much more likely to live alone today than they were a generation ago. Still, the rise in single member households has been slowing since the early 1980s, when there was a recession.

In the politics of the future, California will exercise more clout than any smoke filled room of politicians ever did. California emerges from the 1990 census as a political behemoth, with 52 House seats, a population bigger than Canada's and 20 percent of the electoral votes needed to be elected president. Add together the congressional representation of 21 states and they still will total fewer than the delegation from California, which swells by seven in 1992, the result of a 26 percent surge in population in the last 10 years.

While public concern focuses on how imports affect U.S. jobs, nearly 4.6 million American workers owe their livelihoods to exports, the Census Bureau reported Thursday. For example, one of every eight people working in manufacturing is in an export related job, the Bureau found. The analysis of employment in 1986 showed an increase of 163,400 export related jobs from the year before.

In 1960, for example, half of all women were married before they were 20, while the median age today is closer to 24.; The share of households, of what we call mom and pop households, is shrinking, said Don Starsinic, chief of the population distribution branch at the Census Bureau. ; And the effect can be seen everywhere, from the prevalence of single serving packages available in the grocery to the popularity of townhouses in the suburbs and the ubiquitous advertisements for singles apartments.

In his letter to Sheila Grimm, regional director of the Census Bureau, Dinkins asked that the bureau review some 11,900 city blocks approximately 43 percent of the city's more than 28,000 residential blocks.

The offspring of the Baby Boomers are continuing their sharp increase of recent years, the Census Bureau reported today. The number of Americans aged 5 and under totaled 18.3 million as of 1987, up from 18.2 million in 1986 and just over 18 million the year before that. Still, the total is well short of the 20.5 million preschoolers recorded in 1961, near the end of the post World War II Baby Boom.

This process would have been a lot easier for us if the areas had been designated by the state or federal government, said US Ecology's Paton, but I believe the controversy will die down when we show we are not out there to try and do harm.

A new study concludes that skewing the Census Bureau's national headcount, as has been proposed in various forms by lawmakers and special interest groups, would make little difference in the allocation of House seats. Population shifts since 1980 are expected to result in the shift of 18 or more seats, various experts agree. But even combining the various suggested adjustments would shift a maximum of just four additional seats among California, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Minnesota, population analyst William P. O'Hare reports.

Historically a nation of youthful orientation, the United States is now thirty something, heading upward, the Bureau reports. Combining to increase the median age of the population are the maturing of the massive post World War II Baby Boom and that generation's relatively low birth rates, which reduce the number of babies to pull down the numbers.

A storm that staggered the Rockies with snow sealed parts of the Midwest inside a thick layer of ice Thursday, pulling down power lines that served more than 90,000 customers in Des Moines, Iowa, and turning roads into skating rinks. Some major Wyoming highways remained closed a third day by deep snow, idling travelers in motels, restaurants, truck stops and shelters, although temperatures rose above freezing. Hundreds of schools were closed because ice or snow made travel hazardous, or because of lack of electricity.

It also turned down the attorney general's demand for information about individuals suspected of being communists during a Red Scare in 1947. And in 1980 the bureau refused to comply with a federal court order demanding addresses for certain city officials.

The typical American household, nearly six members strong when the nation was new, is down statistically to just over 2{ people, a record low, the Census Bureau said Thursday. The decline reflects changes in the age structure of the American population, said Census Bureau demographer Campbell Gibson in a telephone interview. The household is shrinking as families have fewer children, more young people set up housekeeping on their own and the number of elderly maintaining their own households grows.

If present trends continue, census officials expect that half of all Americans will be over the age of 39 by the year 2010, and half younger. The agency's most recent estimate of median age was 32.1, as of last July 1, the highest ever.
