Michigan and Ohio residents awakened to a rainy Thanksgiving Day, with the precipitation expected to spread as far south as Texas, while most of the West and Midwest basked in clear but cooler weather. The rain, spreading from the Great Lakes region, along the inland edges of several East Coast states and into the South, was caused by an unusually cold front of air from the north colliding with a warm front moving up from the South. The conditions also brought rain to Kentucky early today and cloudy or foggy skies to Massachusetts, New York, the Carolinas, Florida, Georgia and Oklahoma.

After a final spell of rain in the Cascade Range today, clearing skies and colder temperatures were expected to ease flooding that caused property damage and prompted evacuations in northwest Washington and British Columbia. Days of heavy rains and melting snow in the mountains caused rivers and streams to overflow, and flood warnings remained in effect this morning. The worst property damage was along the Nooksack River east of Bellingham, where a house and two trailers, a highway bridge and a minor railroad span were swept away.
