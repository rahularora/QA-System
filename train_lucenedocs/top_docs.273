Three top executives at Suzuki Motor Co.'s beleaguered U.S. sales arm resigned suddenly and a fourth accepted reassignment to an unspecified job with the auto maker in Japan. The sweeping changes are a further disruption for Suzuki, which hasn't rebounded from safety allegations last year against its Samurai sport utility vehicle. The moves also come on the heels of Suzuki's inability this year to successfully sell its first car in the U.S.

With sales of its Samurai sport utility vehicle slumping, Suzuki Motor Co. blasted Consumer Reports magazine for using distorted testing to reach the inaccurate and defamatory conclusion that Samurai is unsafe because it tends to roll over in sharp turns. At a 90 minute news conference beamed by satellite from Los Angeles to reporters in Detroit and New York, the company escalated its war on Consumers Union of U.S. Inc., the magazine's publisher, accusing it of biased and seriously flawed testing. Doug Mazza, vice president and general manager of American Suzuki Motor Corp.'s automotive division, said Suzuki, a small Japanese company is being unfairly singled out for criticism.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said there have been 44 reported incidents of Samurais rolling over, involving 53 injuries and 16 deaths. Consumers Union filed a petition with the NHTSA seeking rules requiring that sport utility vehicles be put through road tests for safety, rather than just requiring them to meet design standards.

The Suzuki Samurai, a popular sport utility vehicle, tends to roll over in sudden turns and should be banned, the publishers of Consumer Reports magazine said Thursday.

Boosted by rebates that could cut the sticker price by almost 25 percent, U.S. sales of the Suzuki Samurai set a record in August despite concerns about the four wheel drive vehicle's safety. Official sales figures will not be reported until Tuesday, but Douglas Mazza, general manager of Suzuki's automotive division, said Friday he hoped the total would exceed 10,000 for the month. The surprising turnaround appears to be the result of the generous dealer incentive program by the Japanese carmaker and fading public concern about the rollover issue raised by Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine.

The Suzuki Samurai is so unstable it literally trips over its own feet and rolls over, says the publisher of Consumer Reports, which gave the popular sport vehicle its first not acceptable rating in 10 years. But the American Suzuki Motor Corp. defended the Japanese built Samurai as safe and said there was no justification for the magazine publisher's claim that it should be banned because it tends to turn over in sudden turns. Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, said Thursday the Samurai is too short, too narrow, too light and has too high a center of gravity to be safe.

Concerned because manufacturers and dealers often installed back seats and other passenger related equipment after the vehicles cleared customs as trucks, Mr. Dingell asked the Customs Service to determine whether the Japanese companies were intentionally circumventing the quota.

American Suzuki Motor Corp. said today it has agreed to put safety warnings in advertising for its four wheel drive Samurai to settle a dispute with the attorneys general of seven states. The company said the messages which warn against abrupt maneuvers in the so called sport utility vehicles are to be included in all ads and promotional material. The dispute with the top law enforcement officials of California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Texas and Washington stems from a controversy that erupted in June over a consumer group's allegation the sporty cars were likely to roll over.

In a short report explaining why it turned down the recall request, the agency criticized rollover tests conducted by Consumers Union and NBC News on the Samurai, contending they do not have a scientific basis and cannot be linked to real world crash avoidance needs. The Consumers Union spokeswoman defended the group's tests, saying they were meant to replicate typical driving situations. The agency, however, approvingly cited Suzuki's tests of the Samurai, saying they demonstrated that the vehicle satisfactorily completed industry accepted tests which might be used to assess a vehicle's rollover propensity.

The publisher of Consumer Reports magazine called on Suzuki Motor Co. to buy back its Samurai sports utility vehicles, saying the model has a hazardous propensity to roll over when a driver attempts to avoid an accident. In the July issue of the magazine, Consumers Union of U.S. Inc. will rate the Samurai not acceptable, the first time in 10 years it has so classified a vehicle. At a news conference here, the nonprofit testing group called the vehicle's design inherently dangerous and said it can't be modified to rectify the problems.

Most U.S. companies are ignoring President Reagan's order to pay taxes owed Panama into a Treasury Department escrow account established to pressure strongman Manuel Noriega to resign, U.S. officials say. Reagan last April ordered U.S. companies with offices in Panama to withhold taxes they owe its government and instead pay them into the U.S. escrow account. The idea was that the money would be turned over to Panama once Noriega has resigned or been forced from office.

Last February, Sweden's AB Volvo and France's Renault S.A. announced a broad alliance that will be cemented by cross shareholdings and cooperation on a range of products.

The accidents resulted in three deaths and injuries to eight other people, the group said in a petition filed last week with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.

The group said it has evidence of 11 accidents in which a Samurai rolled over after a skid or a sharp turn. The accidents resulted in three deaths and injuries to eight other people, the group said in a petition filed last week with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. But Suzuki, in an unusually combative response, said the consumer group's charges that the Samurai's high center of gravity made it too easy to tip over were instigated in part by trial lawyers seeking to foster public opinion against Suzuki and perhaps the entire sport utility industry.

This week, Suzuki started giving dealers $2,000 incentives on sales of the sport utility vehicle. The company isn't requiring dealers to cut the Samurai's prices with the incentive, but many dealers say they'll immediately lop a whopping 25% off the Samurai's $7,995 base price.

The U.S. Customs Service ruled Thursday that the tiny Suzuki Samurai sport utility vehicle will continue to be counted as a truck since it enters the country without back seats, which are added later. Suzuki Motor Co.'s Samurais are imported into the United States as trucks because Suzuki doesn't have a large enough allocation under the Japanese government's voluntary export restraints to ship them as cars or sport utility vehicles. This decision doesn't make any sense when people see how these vehicles are being used in the United States, but in this case the Customs Service has no choice, said Customs Commissioner William von Raab.

Under a less publicized quota that was designed to cover station wagons, which are considered trucks in Japan but cars in the United States, the Japanese government also limits exports of sport utility vehicles and minivans shipped to this country to 113,000 to 115,000 a year. Suzuki, which gives nearly all its car allocation to General Motors Corp. for the imported Chevrolet Sprint, built by Suzuki in Japan, also has no sport utility vehicle allocation. Earlier this year, Suzuki told the Customs Service it would be forced to close its U.S. dealerships if the Samurai were classified as a car.

Earlier this year, Suzuki told the Customs Service it would be forced to close its U.S. dealerships if the Samurai were classified as a car. But when that information became public, Suzuki denied it had any intention of closing dealerships and said it instead was aggressively expanding its U.S. dealer network.

When Toshiba Corp.'s top two executives resigned last week, it said a lot about how Japanese managers differ from their U.S. counterparts. The Toshiba executives said they were taking responsibility for a subsidiary's sale of militarily sensitive technology to the Soviet Union. Most U.S. executives probably wouldn't even consider resigning over an issue like that; while both American and Japanese managers are responsible for the bottom line, the Japanese corporate chief is expected to make symbolic gestures and, at times, personal sacrifices that most U.S. executives aren't.

Sales of the Suzuki Samurai broke a monthly sales record by 45.9 percent in August as sharp price cuts helped it stage a comeback from the damage done by allegations that it was an unsafe vehicle. Samurai sales plunged by 70.6 percent in June after Consumers Union charged that the small, boxy, four wheel drive vehicle was dangerously top heavy and prone to rolling over. August sales totaled 12,208, up from the 2,199 sold in June.
