The guy who'll run the league is Dennis Murphy, who helped start the WHA, American Basketball Association and Team Tennis. In charge of basketball operations when there are some, and public relations in the meantime, is Bob Cousy, the old Boston Celtics' flash. Some say basketball hasn't been the same since the 6 foot 1 inch Cooz hung it up back in '63.

Huffy is planning a national television advertising campaign to push the new line in April and May. True Temper Hardware, which Huffy acquired from Black &amp; Decker Corp. in November 1990, started 1991 slowly but had a terrific fourth quarter and December, Mr. Shaw said. Sales were especially strong in a new line of childrens' garden tools and adult pruning tools, including shears and clippers.

Fans across America might eagerly be awaiting the start of the oina season if an American here had not changed a few rules and renamed it baseball, according to a Romanian sports official. Adding his voice to the decades old debate over the origin of baseball, Cristian Costescu said the American pastime derived from the ancient game of oina, which was introduced to the United States by a pair of Transylvanians. Costescu, president of the new Romanian Baseball Federation, says the two immigrants from the Romanian village of Alba Iulia joined the U.S. Army and taught the game to their comrades.

Last Thursday, they got their initial round National Basketball Association playoff series against the New York Knicks off skippingly by winning a track meet, 126 85. In Sunday's second game of the best of five test, the visitors made the going stickier about the consistency of mud but the Bulls prevailed here again, 89 79.

Harwood Cos., a boys' and men's clothing maker, says one customer threatened to fine it up to $100 for a mislabeled $7 garment. Few can blame retailers for such tactics: Their cash flows improve, they save interest and storage costs and also avoid big markdowns in January. In September, U.S. retailers' inventory to sales ratio was 1.57, according to the Commerce Department, down from 1.60 for September 1989 and 1.59 in September 1990.
