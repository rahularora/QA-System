Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO Shanghai and Bangkok will be the subject of a three year study by a group of Japanese scientists to help curb environmental destruction in the face of Asia's rapidly expanding population, officials of the Health and Welfare Ministry said Wednesday [9 March]. The study will be launched later this year and will focus on the impact of urbanization and population growth on consumption of energy, a main source of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases believed to cause global warming, the officials said. Scientists say the change in climate could ultimately turn entire regions into deserts.

Seven babies are born every second in Asia and the continent may be only days away from reaching 3 billion inhabitants, an occasion causing some concern in the world's most crowded corner, experts said Friday. China, faced with a motherlode of maternity, marked the occasion with a ceremony and speeches that urged its citizens to keep practicing birth control. In Tokyo, a group of experts gathered to debate the significance of the approaching milestone, its effects on the family and the growing problem of feeding all those people.

BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO A Japanese Government advisory panel on Tuesday [31 May] proposed a three stage scheme to build a nationwide optical fiber telecommunications network by 2010 as part of efforts to facilitate the shift to an information oriented society in the next century. The scheme would create jobs for 2.43 million people by boosting Japan's multimedia market by 56 trillion yen to 123 trillion yen by the targeted year, said the Telecommunications Council, an advisory body to the posts minister. The council said the telecom project would help correct the over centralization of information in Tokyo, quicken economic restructuring in Japan through the creation of new business and expand leisure time of the Japanese people as a result of an expected diffusion of satellite remote offices.

The amendment was submitted after a 1993 Osaka High Court ruling that the current maximum disparity of 6.48 to 1 violates the constitutional principle of equality for all under the law, the legislators said. The amendment would reduce the maximum disparity to 4.81 to 1, they said. The bill was initially introduced in the upper chamber under the cosponsorship of the Liberal Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party [of Japan], Komeito [Clean Government Party], the Niin Club and the Shin Ryokufu Kai a parliamentary group comprising the Democratic Socialist Party, the Japan New Party, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the Democratic Reform Party.

BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev warned Friday [8 April] that some leading Russian politicians' attempts to stir up nationalistic sentiments among Russians residing in Kazakhstan and other former Soviet republics may trigger an exodus of refugees. If Russians, Ukrainians and Germans residing in Kazakhstan took Russian politicians' campaigns at face value and opted to move to Russia or other areas, they would plunge into a more severe situation than now, Nazarbayev said. Although such an exodus has not yet begun, my biggest anxiety comes from this issue, Nazarbayev told the Japan National Press Club on the final day of his four day visit to Japan.

BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO The Ministry of Finance [MOF] plans to allow a portion of the revenues collected from the consumption tax to be handled by local governments, ministry sources said Monday [30 May]. The ministry will soon offer a compromise proposal to the Home Affairs Ministry, which, along with local governments, has urged the introduction of a local consumption tax.

BFN [Text] Fukui, March 30 KYODO Activists of the international environmental organization Greenpeace arrived Wednesday [30 March] aboard the patrol boat MV Greenpeace in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, to protest the start up of Japan's prototype fast breeder reactor Monju there. During the 10 day port call at Tsuruga, Captain Arne Sorensen and 18 Greenpeace activists will inform local residents of the dangers Monju poses for the environment in videos and a photo exhibition on the boat, spokeswoman Etsuko Ikeda said. The fast breeder operated by the governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. will soon reach what is called criticality, the stage when a nuclear chain reaction is self sustaining.

Hosokawa and Clinton agreed not to damage bilateral relations though they failed to strike a deal on a new framework to slash Japan's trade surplus and increase the share of imports in its markets, he said. The premier said he and Clinton agreed to promote bilateral cooperation on global issues such as the environment, population and AIDS. Hosokawa said he told Clinton that Japan would do what it could if the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on North Korea over its suspected nuclear arms development program.

He also called the planned one time tax reduction an emergency measure, saying permanent reductions of income and residence taxes will be included in the comprehensive tax reform he has pledged to carry out by the end of the year.

The ruling coalition agreed February 8 to implement a one time 6 trillion yen income tax cut for 1994 as a means of stimulating the sluggish economy. The tax reform package will include financing of the tax cut because, at the time of the agreement, Hosokawa was forced to abandon his plan to replace the 3 percent consumption tax with a 7 percent national welfare tax mainly to finance the reduction.
