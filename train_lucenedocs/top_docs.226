The reply states that the solution to the problem of a sufficient amount of water in the Danube branches [on Hungarian territory] lies in the mutually agreed construction of a dam at Dunakiliti. This would make it possible to supply the network of branches in the Szigetkoz area with up to 140 cubic meters of water per second.

BFN [Text] Bratislava, May 11 (CTK) The Slovak Foreign Ministry reiterated its willingness to continue talks with Budapest on the division of the Danube's waters between the Gabcikovo derivation canal on Slovakia's territory and the Danube's old course, in a note extended to the Hungarian Embassy today, the ministry told CTK. The Ministry proposed that talks take place on May 18 19 in Bratislava. It is already the second date proposed by the ministry for talks on the temporary water regime on the river and it would therefore welcome it if the Hungarian side said it was ready for such talks, the note says.

BFN [Text] Vienna, May 9 (CTK) Representatives of the Austrian section of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) warned today of the pollution of the Danube flood plain forests by the Slovak Gabcikovo water project. The area, which is located on a large gravel subsoil, is the second biggest European source of drinking water. The WWF, which is now launching a campaign to establish a national park in the Danube flood plain forests between Vienna and Slovak border, demonstrated the adverse effects of the regulated water flow on nature to journalists from Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic during a several day educational excursion.

Regular floods in this unique landscape are a precondition of its existence, Alexander Zinke from the WWF said. By diverting 80 90 percent of the Danube water into an insulated channel, the old riverbed receives only a minimum amount of water, which will soon entirely change the natural character of the landscape.

BFN [Text] Bratislava June 7 (CTK) Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan today confirmed Bratislava's rejection of the recommendation by a European Union expert commission that more water be diverted into the old course of the River Danube and less into the canal that serves the hydroelectric power project at Gabcikovo Nagymaros. The recommendation was intended as a compromise in the Slovak Hungarian dispute over what water regime should be adopted until the International Court at The Hague delivers its judgement about the disputed hydroelectric project. The Hungarian Parliament agreed with the experts' recommendations, but decided to supply the branches of the river which are drying up by means of pumps rather than by building weirs.

Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN [Text] Budapest, 8 March (MTI) The Hungarian representative in the Danube Commission recently forwarded a letter to representatives of the other member states, Hungarian Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman announced on Tuesday [8 March]. In the letter, the Hungarian Government, citing the February tragedy of the Ukrainian tugboat, reminded the member states of the Danube Commission that the Slovak Government, in serious violation of its international contractual obligations, rechanneled the Danube river flow in a 40 kilometer section from the river's natural bed, previously used for international shipping, and has thus prevented navigation on this section. In order to fully enforce the safety and freedom of Danube shipping, the Hungarian Government considers it necessary for the Danube Commission to call on the Government of the Slovak Republic to continuously provide the necessary water amount in the natural bed of the Danube in order to restore the original conditions of navigation, as was previously demanded by the Hungarian side.

A statement by the Slovak Foreign Ministry addressed to the members of the Danube Commission, received by CTK today, said that Hungary's representative to the Commission had accused Slovakia of failure to honor the official system of announcing emergency occurrences on the Danube. According to preliminary information by Slovak authorities, the accident in the lock at Gabcikovo was due to man's failure as the captain grossly violated regulations guiding passage through the lock.

The statement also points out Hungary's effort to get the Danube Commission entangled in the dispute between Slovakia and Hungary [over Gabcikovo] even though both parties have agreed to settle the dispute before the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The statement also protests against the effort to include Gabcikovo in the agenda of the Danube Commission's deliberations. It stresses that at the next session of the Commission's relevant body, Slovakia will raise the question of seeking solution to the unfavorable navigation conditions caused by the moves taken by Hungary.

CSO <F P=106> [Article by Ann Marsh: Slovak Dam Project Remains a Source </F> of International Tension ] [Text] Water traffic along the Danube river, blocked for more than a month because of a malfunction at Slovakia's Gabcikovo dam, lurched back into motion April 27, clearing the way for hundreds of irate ship owners to complete their deliveries. Caused by a mixture of bad luck, bad blood and bad planning, the breakdown of the dam's lock system has featured the suspected murder of a ship captain, insinuations of espionage and millions of dollars in damages claimed by shipping companies. It also has fulfilled some of the worst predictions about the communist era dam and hydroelectric project, which began operating in 1992.

GERMANY weighed in yesterday behind Hungary's increasingly frantic efforts to stop Slovakia from damming and diverting the river Danube to feed the controversial Gabcikovo hydroelectric barrage. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, issued a veiled warning of the economic price of 'rash decisions' in the dam dispute after Slovakia began at the weekend to block the Danube with quarry rock and concrete blocks. Mr Kinkel said, without explicitly singling out Slovakia, that the European Community's 'goodwill' in providing economic support was in danger.

Gyorgy Tatar claims, moreover, that the Slovak attitude actually confirms our negative stand on the EU recommendation, which, according to Hungarian newspapers, proposes that 40 percent of the Danube water remain in the river's original bed and that Budapest build two small dams on its territory. In this affair, which may seem immaterial, we are, thus, once again in the position of the evil side that does not honor its commitments.

BFN [Text] Bratislava, April 8 (CTK) A note sent today by the Slovak Foreign Ministry to the Hungarian Embassy in Bratislava expresses Slovakia's readiness to resume as early as possible the talks on the establishment of a temporary water regime on the Danube. The Slovak Ministry thus responded to a note from the Hungarian Foreign Ministry of March 28, in which Budapest urged the Slovak government to resume the negotiations immediately. The Hungarian note reacted to Slovakia's rejection of a compromise proposal by European Union experts for the method of division of the Danube's water between the original bed of the border river and a derivation canal built by Bratislava on Slovak territory.

In opposition to this, the Slovak note recalls that the EU experts had also recommended to build weirs in the Danube's original bed to prevent drying up of some river's branches, but the Hungarian parliament recently rejected the weirs' construction.

SINCE last weekend wave after wave of Slovak trucks have been lining up on barges strung out across the Danube river near the village of Cunovo, a few hundred metres from the border with Hungary. Round the clock they have been tipping rock and concrete blocks into the swirling waters. Less deadly than the exchange of tank and artillery fire in Yugoslavia, the frenzied activity along this Slovak section of the Danube populated mainly by ethnic Hungarians is nevertheless one of the most serious flashpoints in the short history of post communist Europe.

Now that Mikhail Gorbachev has seized the full reins of power in the Soviet Union he'll presumably press on with making the Soviet economy more like that of Hungary. So it would be timely to take a look at the furor going on behind the Iron Curtain over the Czechoslovak Hungarian hydroelectric project being built on the Danube which has entangled Austria in an embarrassing mess. The great Danube dams have emerged as a white elephant, characteristic of Stalinist central planning monstrously expensive, of dubious utility, ruinous to the environment and contrary to popular will.

The system is said to be a serious threat to, among other things, the drinking water for three million people, farmlands and forests. Benefits meanwhile will be negligible.

A part of the left lock's bottom gate was torn on Sunday [20 March] night due to a so far unknown reason. The resultant wave under the dam damaged mechanisms on the bottom gate of the right lock, which has been blocked by the wrecked Ukrainian boat Zernograd.

Damming was to have begun yesterday and, under the original schedule, navigation of the river was to stop at midnight. The postponement came amid a fierce row over the dam between Slovakia and Hungary whose government says the project would pollute drinking water and change the international border.

HUNGARY said yesterday it was officially pulling out of the controversial Danube hydro electric scheme, fuelling its fierce row with Czechoslovakia. Budapest said it was abrogating the 1977 treaty governing construction of the power plant at Bos Gabcikovo, and was considering turning to the European Community, the Conference for Security and Co operation in Europe or the international court in The Hague if the Czechoslovaks did not stop building. Environmentalists regard the project as a communist monstrosity, which will force much of the flow into a 17km long elevated channel.

A Hungarian energy official Tuesday was quoted as saying a controversial dam project opposed by tens of thousands of environmentalists could be stopped in the nation's interest. The statement was the latest sign Hungary may pull out of the project, a multimillion dollar plan with Czechoslovakia and Austria to make the Danube River more navigable and build power stations in Czechoslovakia and Hungary. About 140,000 Hungarians have signed a petition calling for a referendum on the project, which has been under fire since it was first agreed to in the late 1970s.

Czechoslovak officials already have invested $1.1 billion in a much larger dam and power station being built as part of the project at Gabcikovo, about 40 miles east of Bratislava.

Tens of thousands of people exercised their new freedom Saturday by forming a 100 mile human chain to protest a hydroelectric dam project on the Danube River, the government news agency said. The CTK news agency said 100,000 people from Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Austria formed the chain across territory in all three nations. Meanwhile, thousands of West Germans and Czechoslovak citizens formed a 2.5 mile human chain across their common border in a gesture of triumph over the waning divisions between East and West, CTK said.

Hungary has called for a special meeting of the eight nation Danube Commission to discuss Slovakia's plans to divert the river across its territory this month, a commission official said yesterday. The Danube forms part of the two states' common border, Reuter reports from Budapest. The move is part of Hungary's efforts to prevent the creation of a billion dollar hydroelectric scheme, which Budapest says would cause an environmental catastrophe and violate Hungary's territorial integrity.

This is technically entirely ruled out, but we can take important steps to this effect, Moravcik said. Bratislava hopes the treaty will confirm the existing border between Slovakia and Hungary, which were set by international conferences following World War One and which have been challenged by certain forces in Hungary. Budapest on the other hand hopes for an extension of the rights of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia.

A government body voted Friday to pull out of a controversial Danube River dam project it said is a symbol of Hungary's mismanaged economic development, the official news agency reported. The decision came in the form of a proposal by an advisory body of the Council of Ministers, but it serves as a strong indication the government and Communist Party leadership will scrap the project. This will delight environmentalists, who have said the Nagymaros dam scheme will destroy wetlands and their unique wildlife, and probably will anger Czecholovakia, which already has spent $1.1 billion on a companion project.

In view of the defective Gabcikovo sluice chambers, the Hungarian Government has called on countries which insist on the principle of free navigation on the Danube, which conduct shipping traffic on the river, and which signed the 1948 Belgrade Convention on the Order of Navigation, to warn the Slovak Government to immediately stop the law breaking action and ensure free passage, Herman said. He drew attention to the Slovak Government's responsibility for the cessation of shipping on the Danube due to a technical and professional error.

HUNGARY yesterday attacked a Slovak plan to divert the Danube river, accusing it of breaking international law, after talks about the controversial hydro electric project broke up in disagreement, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. Slovakia appeared determined to continue with the Bos Nagymaros project, despite Hungary's opposition. Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovakian Prime Minister, even made a veiled threat to complete construction within Slovakia's own territory, according to Hungarian officials.
