Forty years after a copy writer for a small advertising agency took a taffy like substance invented by accident and called it Silly Putty, the toy in the plastic egg is still making an impression. Binney &amp; Smith Inc., Silly Putty's maker, sells more than 3 million eggs a year of the bounceable, moldable, stretchable toy capable of lifting images from newspapers. And this spring, the Easton based company plans to add four fluorescent colors of Silly Putty to the pinkish silicone rubber.

Bush said his $292.1 billion defense budget for 1991 offers a chance to restructure America's defenses in the wake of Europe's revolutionary changes, and he made headlines with last week's proposal to strip hundreds of thousands of U.S. and Soviet troops from the European continent. But the budget proposal also reveals a conservative, take it slow approach in many areas.

Can the cord be removed or is it too much of a job? </P> <P> ANSWER: Removing the sash is not difficult. Merely take off the stop moldings on the inside.
 LA082089-0040 
</P> <P> ANSWER: Removing the sash is not difficult. Merely take off the stop moldings on the inside. Use a chisel or putty knife and work very carefully, especially if you intend to use the moldings again.

Merely take off the stop moldings on the inside. Use a chisel or putty knife and work very carefully, especially if you intend to use the moldings again. If your aim is to replace the sash cord with another of the same type, be sure to observe how the cord is connected so you will be able to replace it without too much trouble.

</P> <P> Can Plywood Be Nailed Directly to Studs? </P> <P> Q: When paneling an extra room with plywood, I can save a lot of time by nailing the plywood directly to the studding. But I read somewhere that it is much better to nail the panels to furring strips that have been attached to the studs.

But I read somewhere that it is much better to nail the panels to furring strips that have been attached to the studs. This seems like extra work. Is it necessary or can I go ahead and nail to the studs?
 LA082089-0040 
This seems like extra work. Is it necessary or can I go ahead and nail to the studs? </P> <P> A: You can nail the plywood right to the studs, but then you risk the studs warping or shrinking later on and causing the wall to be uneven.

The furring strips minimize the possibility of this taking place. In still another method, you put up a drywall and then attach the plywood to it.

He plays a pediatrician whose wife has recently died and left him with three grown daughters, at least two of whom are neurotic, a nurse whose heart is still in Appalachia and a next door neighbor who is a freeloader and free with advice.
