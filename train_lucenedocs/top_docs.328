President elect George Bush's bass fishing trip to a private lake Thursday will take him to a small, historic community that once played host to another vice president, Aaron Burr. Bush's itinerary calls for four hours of fishing with Ray Scott, whose 55 acre lake is near the historic Pintlala site in rolling terrain 15 miles south of Montgomery. We just want to get in some fishing, said Scott, who became a friend, political ally and infrequent fishing partner of Bush's in 1978.

A long hidden cache of personal letters unveiled Monday should give historians new insight into one of the leaders of the famed Lewis and Clark expedition that explored the northern Plains and the Northwest. The 47 letters from Capt. William Clark five of them written during the 1803 1806 expedition into the newly acquired Louisiana Territory are a tremendous find, said James R.

The effort by Oliver North to compel President Reagan and President elect Bush to testify at his Iran Contra trial has renewed a debate, almost as old as the Union, over executive privilege. Can a president, or a former one, be forced to testify in a legal case? Courts have provided little guidance, but constitutional experts said Tuesday that North's legal tactic may succeed.

But the boom also is bringing urban style headaches to rural Camden County.

'Looking for a way out'; In his closing argument, Burr said Robinson, 27, is not the bespectacled yuppie he appears to be sitting at the defense table but an impatient, violent man, tired of the hard life of prison and West Oakland streets and looking for a way to break out. ; The means to that end was through killing Newton, a crack using has been hero of Oakland's black community who used to get drugs simply by declaring I'm Huey P. Newton, Burr said. To Robinson, killing Newton was a way to gain notoriety in the Black Guerrilla Family, a prison based gang, and become a decision maker in its drug sales network, Burr said.

The former head of now defunct People Express Airlines says the labor crisis gripping Eastern Airlines has raised the prospect that the government will try to re regulate the airline industry that it opened up a decade ago a task he says the government is ill equipped to handle.

Chairman Frank Lorenzo, says the government already is failing to oversee the industry adequately and would be unable to do so if it again re imposed stiff regulations on fares. Eastern has been virtually grounded by a two week old strike by its Machinists union, which has been supported by most of the airline's pilots and flight attendants.

In their traveling debates, the candidates pelted each other, relentlessly, with marshmallows while audiences coast to coast wondered if the cavalry would never come. Democrat or Republican, the usual pattern was that the pack would chase the front runner since he had the most votes and some might drop loose.

Democrat or Republican, the usual pattern was that the pack would chase the front runner since he had the most votes and some might drop loose. Issues were as hard to find as passion. Almost invariably, nobody picked on Jackson or the reincarnated Hart because one man's votes were unbudgeable and the other's non existent.

Issues were as hard to find as passion. Almost invariably, nobody picked on Jackson or the reincarnated Hart because one man's votes were unbudgeable and the other's non existent. Jackson, once the voice of protest in the land, took on the role of establishment harmonizer and gently chided the others when they lost their heads and became adversarial.

They were also called traitor, lecher, murderer, thief, drunkard, atheist, pickpocket, syphilitic, gorilla. In the campaign of 1800, John Adams' Federalists described Thomas Jefferson as a mean spirited, low lived fellow, the son of a half breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father ... raised wholly on hoecake made of coarse ground Southern corn, bacon and hominy, with an occasional change of fricasseed bullfrog.
