His appalled family threatened to cut off his allowance, and so he went home, his saved head soon reverberating with Tintern Abbey. The Girondists in the meanwhile mostly headed up the long steps to the guillotine, dispatched there by Robespierre and the Jacobins.

This account of the young Coleridge is a fit sequel to Mr. Holmes's magisterial biography of Shelley (1974). Perhaps its greatest achievement is to have reminded us of how complex Coleridge was, how he managed to salvage an enlivening passion even from disappointment and dissipation. If he does not leap out of these pages brilliant, animated, endlessly provoking and invade your imagination, Mr. Holmes writes in his preface, then I have failed to do him justice.

Few readers, perhaps, will close this book unexasperated by Coleridge's foibles; I think none will come to the end unmoved by his painfully expansive genius.

DOLPHINS by Stephen Spender Faber and Faber Pounds 12.99 (Pounds 5.99 paperback) 46 pages This month, the great cultural monument that is Sir Stephen Spender will be 85 years of age. It is now more than 30 years since the death of Louis MacNeice, 20 since the deaths of WH Auden and C. Day Lewis and 10 since that of Christopher Isherwood. Spender, the last surviving member of that much memorialised generation of the 1930s, has survived them all and he continues to write and review regularly to this day.

His last full collection, The Generous Days, was published in 1971; his Collected Poems of 1985, though containing some new works (including notable elegies to MacNeice and Auden) was largely a re presentation often drastically re worked of older material.

Another, 'Air Raid', captures a moment in 1941 when a bomb, that 'unreasoning fury from an enemy's vision of life', destroys the outer walls of a house, turning what had once been private and inside a bath, a wardrobe, books, the telephone into a public spectacle.

As a spokesman for liberal values, no matter how hopelessly privileged the spokesman may at times seem to be, Spender has also made his mark: to argue for the sacredness of the individual and his impulses is, after all, one of the finest fruits of the romantic movement.

The red building tucked away in the scenic mountains of northwest Virginia looks more like a schoolhouse than the nation's first prefabricated jail made from converted shipping containers. New picnic tables in the back overlook a lush green field. There's plenty of room outside the building for exercise or picnics.

COTTAGE TALES by John Clare Carcanet Pounds 9.95, 158 pages JOHN CLARE: THE POET AND THE PLACE by Peter Moyse Crossberry Press, Helpston Pounds 11.95, 120 pages UNLIKE many other poets of the English countryside John Clare, who was born 200 years ago this week, had a thorough going knowledge of every aspect of rural life and he wrote about it without sentimentality. Given his background, this is not surprising. Born in the small village of Helpston, then in Northamptonshire now in in Cambridgeshire, to parents that Clare himself described as 'illiterate to the last degree', he worked at a whole range of physical tasks as the occasion and the needs of the family demanded: as corn thresher, ploughboy, gardener (at Burghley House, Stamford), lime burner and pot boy at the local inn.

Back home in the early 1770s, equipped with a law degree, he found his voice, or rather his voices his extraordinary and, until Rilke, unchallenged inner oneness with the German language. He began writing remarkable poetry: dithyrambs such as Prometheus that anticipate both the excited, sweeping energy of Shelley and the ecstatic precision of Hopkins; and alongside them simple, stark ballads that remind us of Wordsworth or Coleridge. He started Faust around then and, although he was to go on reworking and expanding it until his death in 1832, this Urfaust involving the original story of the forsaken love, infanticide and execution of poor Gretchen turned out to be the best part of the whole gigantic edifice, bringing Goethe's cheery pantheistic optimism face to face with evil and tragedy.

It's too soon to tell whether the innovation will confound the 19th century historian Thomas Macaulay's conviction that as civilization advances, poetry almost necessarily declines.

THIS week the Poetry Society hosted a tribute to Sidney Keys, a poet who died exactly 50 years ago in the Tunisian Campaign at the age of 20, just two weeks into his active service. The evening was as much a meeting of old friends and an opportunity to exchange reminiscences as an account of the poet's life and work. Keys' editor Michael Meyer and the poet John Heath Stubbs were the presenters.

Sidney Keys, though sentimentalised after his death, has not so much been praised for the wrong reasons as largely forgotten, which is an injustice because his poetry at its best has enduring qualities and his war poetry, though none of it written during his brief period of active service, was driven, like Wilfred Owen's, by an identification with the helpless conscript.

The more immediate mentor of this lyrically educative gang is W.H. Auden, whose easy speech, Mr. Spiegelman says, sounds like meditation at random but actually propounds serious lessons about the state of the world. From Auden, the analysis proceeds from poet to poet, construing their very different work as a rhetoric of instruction and argumentation.

Beyond the attributes of technique there is in Mahon's best poems an endlessly ponderable richness of language, a sense of which may be gained from the opening stanza of his most celebrated piece, 'A Disused Shed in Co. Wexford': 'Even now there are places where a thought might grow /Peruvian mines, worked out and abandoned /To a slow clock of condensation, /An echo trapped for ever, and a flutter /Of wild flowers in the lift shaft, /Indian compounds where the wind dances /And a door bangs with diminished confidence, /Lime crevices behind rippling rain barrels, /Dog corners for bone burials; /And in a disused shed in Co.

TENNYSON by Peter Levi Macmillan Pounds 20, 370 pages SLIGHTLY more than 100 years ago, in October 1892, Tennyson had the biggest, most public funeral of any English poet a spectacular ceremonial in Westminster Abbey with survivors of the Light Brigade lining the aisle. It was an appropriate final tribute to a poet whose work had penetrated every literate household in the land. What other poem has ever become so inextricably interwoven with history and national pride as The Charge of the Light Brigade?

We read once more of the poet's upbringing as the fourth son of a drunken Lincolnshire rector, and of his attendance at Louth Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was one of the earliest members of the Apostles debating society. He went down from the university with the Chancellor's Gold Medal for his poem Timbuctoo but without a degree.

Oliver Hindle is the newest choreographer to be nurtured by Peter Wright with the Birmingham Royal Ballet. His Sacred Symphony for the company last May was a professional debut; now, with funding received by Peter Wright (the 1991 Digital Premier Award), his second creation has been made possible. Dark Horizons is set to Shostakovich's chamber symphony (the eighth string quartet in Barshai's arrangement).

The Romantic poet Lord Byron was born with a crippled foot and a great genius. Perhaps compensating for both, he led a multifarious sex life that resulted in repeated bouts with venereal disease. In 1816 his publisher, John Murray, recognizing that Lord Byron had become almost as famous for his sexual exploits as for his poetry, thought of a way to capitalize further on his celebrity author.

This year's Festival, which has just completed its first week, is immensely successful. The opening day included a memorial reading for Alan Hancox, the Cheltenham bookseller who has long been the Festival's patron saint and occasional director perhaps mainly of local interest, but the readings were by Ted Hughes, Seamus Heaney, Michael Foot and Melvyn Bragg, no modest assembly. Then a debate, about war correspondents' capacity to give the whole truth, between America's Martha Gellhorn, the BBC's John Simpson, and Max Hastings, Editor of The Daily Telegraph, which currently sponsors the Festival.

In the process they have created a substantial market in the US, introduced the newly designed tomes into almost every good bookshop in the uk and, from scratch, sold 750,000 volumes in spite of the worst retail conditions for 20 years.

Celebrations in Rome (where the poet's ashes are buried), many organised by the Keats Shelley Memorial Association with support from the British Council and Penguin Italia, have included a series of readings, lectures and films, and these will continue throughout the year. In Lerici, the May Poetry festival offered an evening boat trip in his memory without, on this occasion, significant loss of life.

Those fond of the fictionalised saga might wish to dip into Wild Spirit the Story of Percy Bysshe Shelley (Hodder, Pounds 15.99); Robert Gittings and Jo Manton have re assessed the importance of Mary Shelley's step sister, Claire Clairmont, in Claire Clairmont and the Shelleys (Oxford, Pounds 20), and Judith Chernaik's Mab's Daughters, a fictional re creation of the diaries of the women in the Shelley circle, is available in paperback (Pan Books, Pounds 5.99).

<P> The alchemist was the forerunner of the modern chemist, just as the astrologer was the forerunner of the modern astronomer. When one considers the growing influence of astrology in recent decades from its role in the '60s counterculture and subsequent infiltration of conventional chatter ( What's your sign? ) to its dramatic elevation to high office in the person of the Reagan White House astrologer should it be so surprising to come across a novel that seriously advocates the idea of better living through alchemy?

Thomas Chatterton was an extreme example of the phenomenon of doomed youth. When he died, by his own hand in 1770 at the age of 17, the precocious Bristolian was the author of a series of pseudo medieval poems and a forged correspondence involving a 15th century monk which was so convincing that it kept the scholars quarrelling for years. According to Keats, who dedicated Endymion to him, he was 'the purest writer in the English language'.

THE SUCCESS of Cambridge mathematician Alan Turing as a code breaker is one of the legends of the second world war. Around 1944, when the German naval codes had all been cracked decisively by the government code and cypher school at Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, Turing had (in the words of his biographer, Andrew Hodges) 'learned how to build a brain not an electric brain, as he might possibly have imagined before the war, but an electronic brain. ' If Turing were alive today the harsh English law against homosexual men led to his untimely death in 1954 he would surely take a well deserved pride in the universal labour saving which the electronic brain he and other pioneers conceived plays in all our lives.

A sense of place can create a potent spell in music. To take English composers alone, it is difficult not to hear in Elgar's music the rolling expanses of the Malvern Hills, in Vaughan Williams the pastoral English countryside, or in Britten's more abrasive style the wind swept, open vistas of the Suffolk coast. In John Casken's music the place is the North of England, the mood invariably grey and chill.

The strings form the basic richness and density of sound; then wind, vibraphone and bells are overlaid to add brilliance to the surface. But the orchestra is large for a work of this kind and Casken is not sparing in his use of it, with the result that the score often sounded overwritten. The voice simply did not dominate as it should, although that was not the only reason why.

The voice simply did not dominate as it should, although that was not the only reason why. Despite trying to suggest some of the images in the poetry, the vocal part lacks a strong profile and Thomas Allen's mellifluous singing of its winding lines gave it none of the punch or variety that might have created one.

The final impression was of a lovely sound world, but vague, somewhat monotonous, without any live contact with the poems.

The orchestral part was in the care of Matthias Bamert and the BBC Symphony Orchestra, who had already given a carefully detailed performance of Debussy's La Mer, and the evening ended with an above average account of Sibelius's Fifth Symphony, which kept its concentration through to a splendid final peroration.

The first, another BBC commission, was unabashed entertainment in the composer's easy listening mode: Variations on the nursery rhyme 'Over the hills and far away , served in a sugary sauce and orchestrated with not so much a nod, as a deep bow to Ravel.

What sounds like American urban aggression propels the outer movements along vigorously, while the elegiac centre brings bluesy improvisation.

It is a concerto strong on impact, well crafted to show off its soloist, professional writing in the best sense.
