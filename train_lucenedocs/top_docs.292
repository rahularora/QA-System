Rupert Murdoch's NEWS CORP., which sold its television interests in Australia just two weeks ago so it could take over the country's biggest media company, is returning to the television business there. Transactions announced yesterday would give News Corp. a 15% holding in television stations in Sydney and Melbourne the country's two biggest cities and in the smaller cities of Lismore and Coffs Harbor. Earlier this month, News Corp. sold its television stations in Melbourne and Sydney, plus some small newspapers, radio stations and a recording concern, to Westfield Capital Corp. for the equivalent of $561.3 million.

The write offs left the bank with pre tax losses of ADollars 2.2bn for the six months to March, compared with profits of ADollars 313m a year earlier. Mr Frank Conroy, managing director, expected the substantial write off to ease investors' fears about Westpac's exposure to corporate failures and the weak property market. At the same time, Mr Conroy sought to strengthen the bank's balance sheet by raising ADollars 1.2bn through a 3 for 10 rights issue at ADollars 3 per share.

Early yesterday, Bond Corp. said it has acquired slightly more than 45% of Bell Group, mainly through stock market purchases, and had won two seats on the Bell Group board. Analysts say Adelaide Steamship Managing Director John Spalvins, one of the country's most active entrepreneurs, wants to be dealt into the split up of Mr. Holmes a Court's assets. His move conceivably could block Bond Corp.'s proposed merger with the Bell companies, analysts say.

THE chairman and four directors of Westpac Banking Corporation, Australia's biggest bank, resigned yesterday in the face of criticism from the markets and financial institutions. Sir Eric Neal, chairman, Sir Neil Currie, deputy chairman, and three other long serving directors had accepted responsibility for heavy losses and bad debts which had halved the bank's share price. Westpac's problems came to a head last week when a ADollars 1.2bn (Pounds 488m) rights issue closed 72 per cent undersubscribed, forcing the underwriters to take up shares worth about ADollars 860m.

SA BREWING, the Australian drinks and manufacturing group, yesterday proposed an ADollars 5.7bn (USDollars 4.3bn) merger with Foster's Brewing, the brewing, pastoral and finance group formerly controlled by Mr John Elliott. The merger would create Australia's fifth biggest company, and largely resolve the financial problems of Mr Elliott's International Brewing Holdings (IBH), a private company which owns 38 per cent of Foster's. Mr Ross Wilson, SA Brewing chief executive, said he had 'initiated and developed' the proposal, which is conditional on the appointment of SA Brewing nominees as chairman and chief executive of the merged group.

An announcement early last week that Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. was withdrawing as lead manager of a one billion Australian dollar ($679 million) bond issue for Bell Resources, which was to have reduced the company's interest bill, has further shaken investor confidence.

Speculation is that Bell Group, whose holdings include media, gold and insurance interests, will seek the rest of Pioneer Concrete Services Ltd., an Australian building products and resources group in which Bell acquired a 17% interest in August. A cash bid probably would have to be made at four dollars a share and would cost Bell Group about two billion dollars. As for Bell Resources, some analysts think it unlikely Mr. Holmes a Court will put up the eight billion dollars needed to acquire the remaining shares.

It has not been a good year for bulls in Australia. Time and again, brokers have forecast a sustained rally, only to retreat hurriedly as the All Ordinaries index resumed its downward trend. At yesterday's close of 1,435.2, the index was 13.1 per cent lower than at the end of last year, and down more than 37 per cent since the all time high of 2,300 in October 1987.

That could have had implications for the stability of Australia's financial system unless State Bank of Victoria was acquired by a stronger bank, he suggested at a news conference. Mr. Keating took the opportunity presented by the bank's problem to pursue his aim of selling at least parts of government businesses to reduce public sector debt. Partial privatization of government businesses is supported by some members of the ruling Labor Party, including Mr. Keating and Prime Minister Bob Hawke, but bitterly opposed by the party's left wing faction, in particular.

Shortly after the rights issue debacle, five directors resigned, including the then chairman, and the bank subsequently reported a net loss of ADollars 1.5bn for the year ended September, after writing off more than ADollars 2.6bn against bad and doubtful loans. The bank's problems were reflected in its share price, which fell from ADollars 4.52 in January to a low of ADollars 2.39 earlier this month, presenting a rare opportunity to acquire a significant stake cheaply. Westpac shares closed at ADollars 2.99 yesterday, suggesting that Mr Packer has already made a small profit on his holding, which was acquired at prices of between ADollars 2.52 and ADollars 2.93.

Directors of ELDERS IXL LTD. today will consider a major shareholder's restructuring proposals, which analysts said could include selling some of the concern's Australian and British operations to its shareholders and the sale of Elders's 18% stake in Broken Hill Proprietary Co., Australia's largest company. A restructuring was proposed by AFP Investment Corp., which controls 20% of Elders's shares and Friday said it obtained options for another 14% from Goodman Fielder Ltd. and 6% from SA Brewing Holdings Ltd. AFP, which said it won't exercise those options unless Elders's directors agree to a restructuring, didn't give details of its proposals. Analysts said a merger of Elders and AFP also is possible.

Bond Corporation Holdings, Mr Alan Bond's quoted flagship, is likely to be relaunched later this year following approval from the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) for a change of name to Southern Equities. The company's impending re emergence contrasts starkly with the fate of Mr Bond, the best known of Australia's 1980s entrepreneurs, who was declared bankrupt last month after losing a year long court battle. Mr Peter Lucas, chairman of Bond Corp from September 1990 until last month, says Southern Equities will bear little resemblance to Mr Bond's company.

CAMPBELL Soup, the US food group, last night claimed victory over Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker, after its hostile takeover offer was accepted by the AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial institution. AMP said it had sold a 6.3 per cent stake in Arnotts, reducing its stake to 2.2 per cent. This reversed AMP's earlier decision to reject Campbell's ADollars 9.50 a share offer, which values Arnotts at ADollars 1.3bn (USDollars 870m).

But the reshaping of Australia's media industry will continue, as the scramble to set up television networks intensifies with the sale of Herald's stations and the impending sale of those owned by News Corp.

Fairfax also acquired most of Herald's smaller newspapers in the state of New South Wales, as well as News Corp.'s Tamworth, New South Wales, paper, for a total of $30.1 million.
