For sports chauvinists, which is to say most of us, the great thing about U.S. Olympic Trials meets, like the one for track and field in progress here, is that Our Boys and Girls always win. We also always take second, third, fourth and all the other places. There are no tricky foreign names to unscramble, no East Bloc types to ruin the fun.
