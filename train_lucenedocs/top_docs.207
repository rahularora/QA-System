D'outre Manche, not quite 'Across', as we have it, but 'Beyond the Channel', with its faint hint at a somewhat greater psychological barrier, is a fascinating and even shocking exhibition. Here is no full and scholarly study of its subject and period British art up to the time of Queen Victoria drawn from the wealth of French public taste and connoisseurship. But, rather, a parade of historic French attitudes and assumptions upon the art of our fog shrouded and barbarous land, that amounts to a confession.

The clipper schooner Pride of Baltimore II departed on its maiden voyage Sunday, more than two years after the original Pride sank in a sudden storm, killing four crew members. Like its predecessor, the vessel is modeled after those that sailed the Chesapeake Bay in the 19th century and will visit other cities and foreign countries as Maryland's and Baltimore's goodwill ambassador. In order to meet U.S. Coast Guard safety requirements for carrying passengers, Pride II is almost one third larger than the original Pride and 64 tons heavier.

Archaeologists searching Fort McHenry for underground drainage conduits have stumbled upon a long trench presumably used by infantrymen the night the British attacked Baltimore in 1814. The bombardment of Fort McHenry inspired Francis Scott Key to write the poem The Star Spangled Banner, later adopted as the national anthem. The trench, originally about three feet deep, is about seven feet below today's surface level and is more than 100 feet long.

TOMORROW morning, those selecting the British Lions' rugby squad to tour New Zealand this summer will announce their choices. Gentlemen, you need not bother. I have picked the party for you.
FT931-2254
Gentlemen, you need not bother. I have picked the party for you. Take the day off.
FT931-2254
I have picked the party for you. Take the day off. Although it is never easy to pick Lions' teams, I believe the 1993 party is easier to select than, say, those of 1983 and 1989.
FT931-2254
Take the day off. Although it is never easy to pick Lions' teams, I believe the 1993 party is easier to select than, say, those of 1983 and 1989. Players from England which is vying with New Zealand to be the second best rugby nation in the world obviously should form the core of the party.

Players from England which is vying with New Zealand to be the second best rugby nation in the world obviously should form the core of the party. Some ground rules. First, I am selecting solely on ability.

The new laws have encouraged the up and under as an attacking tactic. Full backs who are safe under a high ball are essential. Gavin Hastings is one and so, generally, is Jonathan Webb.
FT931-2254
Full backs who are safe under a high ball are essential. Gavin Hastings is one and so, generally, is Jonathan Webb. And while neither is entirely reliable with the boot (look at Webb against Wasps last Saturday), there will be other goal kickers in the party.

FT931-2254
The Underwood brothers are scorching attackers and deadly finishers. Ieuan Evans, provided his shoulder is all right, would be a good vice captain. He has led Wales well since he was appointed captain 18 months ago.
FT931-2254
Ieuan Evans, provided his shoulder is all right, would be a good vice captain. He has led Wales well since he was appointed captain 18 months ago. The fourth wing is a toss up between Ian Hunter of Northampton and Ireland's Simon Geoghegan.
FT931-2254
He has led Wales well since he was appointed captain 18 months ago. The fourth wing is a toss up between Ian Hunter of Northampton and Ireland's Simon Geoghegan. Geoghegan is the better wing, Hunter the more rounded player who can play full back as well.
FT931-2254
The fourth wing is a toss up between Ian Hunter of Northampton and Ireland's Simon Geoghegan. Geoghegan is the better wing, Hunter the more rounded player who can play full back as well. Since versatility is an asset on tour, I prefer Hunter.
FT931-2254
Geoghegan is the better wing, Hunter the more rounded player who can play full back as well. Since versatility is an asset on tour, I prefer Hunter. Will Carling and Jeremy Guscott are unchallenged as the first choice partnership in the centre.
FT931-2254
Since versatility is an asset on tour, I prefer Hunter. Will Carling and Jeremy Guscott are unchallenged as the first choice partnership in the centre. Scott Gibbs, the sturdy young Welshman, should go.
FT931-2254
Will Carling and Jeremy Guscott are unchallenged as the first choice partnership in the centre. Scott Gibbs, the sturdy young Welshman, should go. He is a rock solid tackler, as is Scott Hastings.

Scott Gibbs, the sturdy young Welshman, should go. He is a rock solid tackler, as is Scott Hastings. I give my nod to Hastings, though not by much over the Bath club's promising Phil de Glanville.
FT931-2254
He is a rock solid tackler, as is Scott Hastings. I give my nod to Hastings, though not by much over the Bath club's promising Phil de Glanville. Stuart Barnes and Rob Andrew are as clear a choice as stand off halves as Carling and Guscott outside them.

I give my nod to Hastings, though not by much over the Bath club's promising Phil de Glanville. Stuart Barnes and Rob Andrew are as clear a choice as stand off halves as Carling and Guscott outside them. They complement one another.
FT931-2254
Stuart Barnes and Rob Andrew are as clear a choice as stand off halves as Carling and Guscott outside them. They complement one another. Barnes has an edge on a firm pitch because of the way he can get his line moving.
FT931-2254
They complement one another. Barnes has an edge on a firm pitch because of the way he can get his line moving. He demonstrated this brilliantly at Twickenham against Scotland.
FT931-2254

The competition between them will be keen. Gary Armstrong is the obvious first choice at scrum half. Will the other be Dewi Morris, whose tendency to play as a ninth forward can be so useful, or Robert Jones, the quick passing technician?
FT931-2254
Gary Armstrong is the obvious first choice at scrum half. Will the other be Dewi Morris, whose tendency to play as a ninth forward can be so useful, or Robert Jones, the quick passing technician? Jones could have lost his chance by operating behind a beaten pack for most of the season.

FT931-2254
He will benefit from regular competition, which he does not get with Preston Grasshoppers. Martin Bayfield should go along with Martin Johnson, who is known and respected in New Zealand. Candidates for the fourth place as a lock include Gareth Llewellyn, who has blossomed this season as captain of Neath; Neil Francis of Ireland; and the Scots, Doddie Weir and Damian Cronin.

Flankers? Peter Winterbottom picks himself because he is one of the best in the world. I think Neil Back deserves a chance to demonstrate his phenomenal workrate on the open side.
FT931-2254
Peter Winterbottom picks himself because he is one of the best in the world. I think Neil Back deserves a chance to demonstrate his phenomenal workrate on the open side. Mike Teague is another New Zealand style forward, a man who blossomed on tour in Australia four years ago and could do so again this summer.

I think Neil Back deserves a chance to demonstrate his phenomenal workrate on the open side. Mike Teague is another New Zealand style forward, a man who blossomed on tour in Australia four years ago and could do so again this summer.

He deserves a chance. Now, having picked the team one must address the ticklish question of the captaincy. It is true that Carling is the most successful captain in world rugby.

Now, having picked the team one must address the ticklish question of the captaincy. It is true that Carling is the most successful captain in world rugby. But that does not take in to account that he does not seem entirely at ease with it and, more to the point, what goes with it the media and all that.

Michael Scott, Ireland's foremost architect who designed his country's shamrock shaped pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair, has died at the age of 83. Scott, who died Tuesday at home, designed some of Dublin's best known modern buildings, including the state broadcasting company's headquarters, the central bus station, and the home of the Abbey Theater, Ireland's premier playhouse. The World's Fair building, named best pavilion by an international jury, won him global recognition, and Mayor Fiorello La Guardia awarded Scott honorary citizenship of New York.
