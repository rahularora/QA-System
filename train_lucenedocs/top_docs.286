In an emotional reunion 44 years later, George Bush paid tribute to the his World War II Navy flying comrades and the submarine crewmen who nicknamed him Ellie after pulling him from the drink. Fireworks lit up the sky over the Lincoln Memorial as Bush, about to become the nation's 41st president, spent half an hour of quiet reflection Wednesday night with about three dozen of his war buddies. He spoke with great feeling about what the squadron and the Finback's crewmen meant to him, said retired Rear Adm. Lawrence Heyworth of Virginia Beach, Va. Mrs. Bush's eyes kind of teared up a little.

Archeologists digging just three blocks from the White House have unearthed thousands of relics from Washington's notorious old red light district, where Civil War prostitutes earned their nickname entertaining Gen. Joseph Hooker's troops. Shoveling beneath an asphalt parking lot just south of Pennsylvania Avenue in the shadow of the Commerce Department this summer, investigators found perfume bottles, gaudy buttons, costume jewelry, garter hooks and a long forgotten cellar full of whiskey and beer bottles. There was even a tiny, antique Bromo Seltzer bottle for treating a morning after malaise.

There was even a tiny, antique Bromo Seltzer bottle for treating a morning after malaise. Besides these artifacts of the hookers' trade, the investigators discovered a wide assortment of everyday objects left by common laborers, immigrants, runaway slaves and other poor folk who once inhabited the crime ridden neighborhood known as Murder Bay in the mid 19th century.

George Bush may be the Big Elephant in the inaugural parade next week, but his buddies on a World War II submarine remember him as Ellie the Elephant, the fun loving young Navy pilot they rescued from the Pacific Ocean 44 years ago. Surviving crew members of the USS Finback are looking forward to a nostalgic reunion with Bush here next Wednesday, two days before they watch him take the presidential oath of office on the West Front steps of the Capitol. Inaugural planners have passed the word to several Finback veterans that Bush is setting aside time to meet with them at Blair House, across the street from the White House, to swap war stories and renew old acquaintances.

Surviving crew members of the World War II submarine Finback are looking forward to a nostalgic reunion with George Bush, the young Navy pilot they dubbed Ellie the Elephant after rescuing him from the Pacific Ocean more than 44 years ago.

The ruling by Judge Mariana Pfaelzer comes at a time of controversy about police brutality in Los Angeles in the aftermath of the videotaped beating of motorist Rodney King last month. On Friday a Los Angeles Superior Court jury awarded about $8.8 million in damages to another man, wounded in 1987 by an off duty police officer. That award is believed to be the highest police related damage assessment in city history.

Ally Milder needs all the help she can get for her campaign to unseat Nebraska Democratic congressman Peter Hoagland. But she has no intention of asking Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward Derwinski for a return visit to Omaha. The former Illinois congressman said Monday that Milder's concern was understandable in the aftermath of his reference to illegal aliens as wetbacks, a remark he conceded was a dumb mistake.

And so on Friday, at ceremonies marking the 30th anniversary of the traffic enforcement division, the department will reveal all via mannequins adorned with uniforms past, present and future.

Minnesota's education commissioner is urging schools to drop Indian nicknames, but an Indian leader says that's not necessarily a good idea. If your school district has an Indian mascot, emblem or symbol, please report your progress toward removing them, Commissioner Ruth Randall and state Board of Education president Marjorie Johnson said in a letter this week. They called the names offensive to persons of American Indian culture and reminded districts of a board resolution adopted last year encouraging removal of Indian mascots.

The guy had a bathing suit before but it was hard to see, said Don Pierce, manager of Naegle Outdoor Advertising Co. in Raleigh. Pierce said the company, which owns the three billboards in Greenville on which the ad appeared, decided to change the sign after talking with the advertiser and the advertising agency that developed it. The original ads for the Carpet Bargain Center had the face of an area television announcer imposed on a reclining body that was clad in flesh colored briefs.
