The world's first test tube tiger cub pounced and growled during her National Zoo debut Tuesday before settling down with a big bottle of milk. The 20 pound bouncing Bengal is one of a litter of three cubs produced by in vitro fertilization in an effort to save endangered tiger species. Mary Alice, the only surviving cub, was born by Caesarean section April 27.

This was a gesture to show China's determination to outlaw the trading in tiger bones, rhinoceros horns, and all products containing them, in pursuance of the international treaty on the preservation of endangered animals. But there is a high economic price to pay on the part of the mainland in doing this and the production of a large variety of Chinese medicines will be affected for the time being.

This was a gesture to show China's determination to outlaw the trading in tiger bones, rhinoceros horns, and all products containing them, in pursuance of the international treaty on the preservation of endangered animals. But there is a high economic price to pay on the part of the mainland in doing this and the production of a large variety of Chinese medicines will be affected for the time being. Tiger bones and rhinoceros horns are fine, natural medicinal materials used in traditional Chinese prescriptions and have always been expensive.

In 1986 the China Administrative Office in Charge of Endangered, Rare and Precious Animals and the Heilongjiang Provincial Government invested over 10 million yuan (about 1.2 million U.S. dollars) to establish a breeding center in a mountainous forest at Hengdaohezi in Hailin County, Heilongjiang, to raise Siberian tigers in captivity.

BFN [Text] Harbin, April 3 (XINHUA) Wild Siberian tigers, which were thought to be on the verge of extinction until recently, are being sighted more and more frequently nowadays in northeast China, due to expanding local forest coverage and meticulous human protective measures. Miao Liping, a worker with the Dongfanghong Forestry Bureau in Heilongjiang Province, and other passengers on a bus saw a female Siberian tiger and three cubs drinking from a spring near the Qiyuan Forest Farm not so long ago. The cubs were each about one m long and 50 cm tall.

To zoo breeders, those charged with the perpetuation of the endangered species in captivity, the decision to bring the gorilla to New York was a simple one: The animal, which had been captured as a baby in the African wilds three decades ago, had never been bred with fertile females. Its genes, uncluttered by the sort of inbreeding that frequently fouls captive populations and turns their delicate lineage into something described as genetic spaghetti, remained isolated from the population of 302 gorillas scattered in cages throughout North America. ; And at age 32, he was practically elderly.

Ten rare species of animals, including the Asian elephant and the black gibbon, will disappear from China in 40 years if the population keeps growing at its current rate, the World Wildlife Foundation says. The foundation's report said that because China must concentrate on providing food, clothes and shelter for its growing population, it lacks the funds to protect endangered species. The report, quoted by the overseas edition of the official People's Daily, said other animals facing extinction are the argali, a wild sheep; Huanan tiger; Northeast tiger; Bactrian camel; crest ibis; black neck crane; Chinese alligator and globefish.

BFN [Text] Beijing, March 30 (AFP) China's forestry ministry denied Wednesday claims by a British organization that it was allowing the illegal trade of tiger bones despite promises to stamp it out. The position of the Chinese government is very clear and very firm: since May 29, 1993, the law prohibits the possession, trading and use of tiger bones and rhinoceros horns, said ministry spokesman Su Yan by telephone. Both substances are used in traditional Asian medicine and are often thought to be aphrodisiacs.

' Zoos hope to correct this problem by becoming increasingly involved in 'in situ' conservation that is, conservation in the wild.

In a lush patch of Brazilian rainforest a group of golden lion tamarins discover the joys of swinging between trees. Brought up in the Los Angeles zoo and recently introduced to the wild, they form part of one of the world's most successful experiments in saving a species from extinction. The project brings together first and third world nations, private and public sectors, environmentalists and farmers, as well as several scientific disciplines.

The rhino horns were part of the 825 kilograms confiscated by the Zhanjiang municipal government from smugglers and illegal trading. As 595 kilograms of rhino horns were identified as having been seized before China joined the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) of wild fauna and flora in 1980, they were exempt from being destroyed.

Though no rhinos are found in the wild in China, the Chinese Government has listed it as one of the key wild animals for national protection, banning its sales, purchase, transportation and import and export, he said. It was the second time for the Chinese Government to burn rhino horns in public this year.

Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN [Text] Zhanjiang, Feb 7 (XINHUA) Some 230 kilograms of rhino horns were set on fire today in Zhanjiang, a booming town of south China's Guangdong Province as part of the efforts by the Chinese Government to perform its international obligations to stamp out smuggling and poaching and protect wildlife. The rhino horns were part of the 825 kilograms confiscated by the Zhanjiang municipal government from smugglers and illegal trading. As 595 kilograms of rhino horns were identified as having been seized before China joined the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) of wild fauna and flora in 1980, they were exempt from being destroyed.

Without intervention, experts say it will vanish within 40 years. The goal of the program is 500 breeding adults in captivity and three wild colonies in 20 years using high tech influences, such as radio telemetry collars and possibly even in vitro fertilization and embryo implants. With captive breeding, four founders adults at the top of distinct family trees and six kittens chosen for their bloodlines will be captured and sent to Miami's MetroZoo, the private White Oak Plantation, Tampa's Lowrey Park Zoo or the Jacksonville zoo in March or April.

One of the first red wolves to produce offspring since the endangered species was reintroduced to the wild has died, and her mate apparently has taken charge of the 9 week old pup, officials said Wednesday. The wolf, thought to have succumbed to disease or infection, was discovered Saturday at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge near Manteo, said refuge manager John Taylor. The pup was nowhere to be found.

However, Hosking, who left here Saturday after a four day visit at the head of a CITES delegation, indicated that while the Chinese authorities had taken important steps to counter the illegal trade in rhinoceros horns and tiger bones, question marks remained over enforcement.

The director of the country's largest zoo denies a Chinese newspaper report that inflation has stopped his tigers from eating live chicken and his elephants from munching bananas. Beijing Zoo director Feng Youlian was quoted in Tuesday's edition of the Guangming Daily as saying his animals have never known hunger. He criticized an Aug. 8 report in the official, English language China Daily, that said the 3,000 animals, birds and fish at the zoo have fallen on lean days because of inadequate funding and sharp rises in food prices.

Helicopters carrying water filled Bambi buckets have helped officials control a fire that threatened to destroy the world's first project to restore rare captive monkeys to the wild in Brazil. We were probably days away from the extinction of a species, said Benjamin Beck, associate director of the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The fire was fought with two helicopters belonging to the Brazilian federal police.
