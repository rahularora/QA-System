Lloyd Bentsen, cast in the role of conservative on the new Democratic ticket, has decided not to bury his differences with the more liberal Michael Dukakis, but to praise them. Before millions of Americans who watched Thursday's convention on prime time television, the Texas senator served notice that he does not believe Democrats must march in lockstep to win the White House. His speech was not as dynamic as that of the presidential nominee, and it did not rouse the crowd to the heights attained by Dukakis' oratory.

Barbara Bush is finished with the radiation treatments for a stubborn eye ailment that has impaired her vision but will not know for at least two months how effective the treatments have been. The first lady underwent the last of 10 radiation treatments on Friday, said Anna Perez, Mrs. Bush's press secretary. After receiving the 10 minute radiation dose at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Mrs. Bush returned to the White House and took her daily swim in the outdoor, heated swimming pool, said Ms. Perez.

But Mr Hatch also reported that his constituent mail was running heavily against Ms Baird and yesterday she acquired another influential opponent in the person of Ms Barbara Jordan, the black Texas University law professor known for her high principles. 'The ethical high ground for Zoe Baird is to request that her name be withdrawn,' Ms Jordan said.

Gramm is the latest Texan to come to the fore as both parties battle for the Lone Star State's 29 electoral votes in the November election. The state's senior senator, Lloyd Bentsen, is the Democratic nominee for vice president; Bush is an adopted Texan who calls Houston home, and at the Democratic National Convention, Texas state Treasurer Ann Richards gave the keynote address, Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower spoke during prime time, and former Rep. Barbara Jordan seconded Bentsen's nomination.

Sheri L. Taylor, 34, of Highland Park, was committed involuntarily Thursday to psychiatric treatment at Rush Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center, but spokeswoman Debbie Jenkins said no update would be made until next week. Documents filed Friday in Cook County Circuit Court showed Ms. Taylor had signed for voluntary admission to the hospital's psychiatric unit, agreeing to stay if necessary up to 30 days, when she will be reevaluated. Police said Ms. Taylor was taken into custody late Wednesday at the Highwood convenience store where she worked.

Barbara Bush said Tuesday she is keeping silent on abortion because speaking out would create controversy whichever way I go, and detract from her work on illiteracy, the homeless, hunger and AIDS. I think that should be left to the people who are courageous enough, number one to run for office, and number two who can do something about it, she told three reporters at a White House reception for disabled award winners. Asked about the focus on abortion in recent elections notably the governor's races Tuesday in New Jersey and Virginia she said that she is not a single issue person and indicated voters should look at other factors instead of the abortion matter.

<P> At least 100 Ventura County firefighters have been dispatched to help battle the disastrous Santa Barbara fire, but officials said they have managed to maintain comprehensive fire protection throughout the county. </P> <P> The idea is that we get everybody we possibly can to cover the local stations, said Sandi Wells of the Ventura County Fire Department. We don't leave any part of the county uncovered, ever.
