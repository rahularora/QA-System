Acts of persecution and harsh anti Semitism among Nazi collaborators were relived and re examined Monday, 50 years after the start of a notorious crackdown that led to the deaths of more than 73,000 French Jews. We must not blame the (Nazi) occupation for what was the sole responsibility of the legitimate French government. The laws met only utter silence from the French people, said former Justice Minister Robert Badinter, who presided over the daylong symposium on The Vichy Laws.

IF THE deranged killer of Rene Bousquet, the former Vichy government police chief, acted criminally in the eyes of the French authorities, it must also be said that he acted conveniently. Bousquet's murder on June 8 came barely a month before France's first annual day of official remembrance for victims of Vichy's 'racist and anti semitic persecutions. ' As a result, when prime minister Edouard Balladur delivered his remembrance day speech in Paris on July 16, he was no longer obliged to explain how the man who had organised many of those 'racist and anti semitic persecutions' was still leading, at 84, the comfortable life of a retired banker barely a mile away on the Avenue Raphael.

' Those who attended the seminars were reminded that Nazi Germany had been able, with only 3,000 members of its own security services operating in France, to secure the arrest and deportation from France of 75,000 Jews and 40,000 resistants, as well as to supply itself with 650,000 French forced labourers.

France observed the 50th anniversary of the formation of the collaborationist Vichy government Tuesday and honored the Parliament members who opposed Marshal Philippe Petain's ascension to power. Petain, a grandfatherly World War I hero, was installed as all powerful leader of the Vichy regime by a 569 80 vote on July 10, 1940. Three of the legislators who voted no survive, and two attended commemorations at Vichy's Grand Casino, where the vote was taken.

Socialists are dismayed that this latest blow to the reputation of their one time leader will further contaminate their own damaged credibility. But not even his rightwing critics have crowed too loudly, for no political clan is quite comfortable when the Vichy era is under discussion.

Savagely attacking Poland a half century ago, Adolf Hitler's armies sparked a conflagration that killed more than 50 million people and spread worldwide in history's costliest war. World War II drew in every major power, leaving behind a bitter legacy from fighting and Holocaust that shape the thinking of nations to this day. The reverberations range from the tensions between the capitalist West and communist East to lingering uneasiness over the possibility of ever reunifying the two Germanys.

There was a key meeting in Gibraltar, on December 4, with Morton present, for those to be involved in Darlan's removal. Henri d'Astier, an equivocal figure serving on Darlan's staff, was recruited to operate covertly with the British and given funds by OSS; his brothers, Jean Bernard and General Francoise d'Astier, were with de Gaulle; the latter was sent to Algiers for discussions with an unwelcoming Eisenhower but also to warn Henri that the Gaullists should lie low, The final role was played by Bonnier, one of a small group of young anti Darlan Frenchmen, who had been given uniforms, rations and pay by 'Brandon'.

Suppose Edward Heath, the British prime minister from 1970 to 1974, had been mixed up with Oswald Moseley's fascist movement in the 1930s and had helped draw up a list of undesirables to help an eventual occupying power.

THE FRENCH may not have won a battle this important in Spain since they took Barcelona in the War of the Spanish Succession 277 years ago. A Catalan court has ruled that the French mineral water giant, Perrier, had a rightful claim to a small fee for every litre of water sold by the only producer of naturally carbonated water outside of France, Vichy Catalan. Although Perrier will earn a mere Dollars 1,040 a year from the ruling, the victory is an important legal foothold from which to press its attack on Europe's fastest growing mineral water market.

PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand and four senior government ministers today begin a four day tour of Israel and Jordan, in an attempt to rebuild France's weakened influence in the Middle East. He will visit Israel for the first time since 1982, when Mr Mitterrand was the first serving French president to do so, thus opening a reconciliation between the two countries. Paris has been eager to forge closer ties since the June election victory of an Israeli Labour administration, committed to progress in peace talks with the Arabs.

In recent days Francois Mitterrand has been behaving like a man clearing his desk, putting a gloss on his presidential record for posterity, and emptying out dusty drawers before the historical cleaners arrive to uncover more murky incidents in his past. One of his doctors affirmed yesterday that the president, whose 78th birthday falls next month and who has been suffering from prostate cancer for at least two years, was 'fine'. And indeed on Thursday Mr Mitterrand was in Berlin to take the farewell to his country's troops there, and he was back in Paris yesterday to greet President Jiang Zemin of China, with whom he will sign some big figure trade contracts today.

MR JEAN MARC Vernes, the French financier, yesterday announced he had withdrawn from negotiations with Nestle, the Swiss food group, to buy part of the Vichy mineral water business. Nestle was last summer instructed by the European Commission to sell a number of the mineral water brands, including Vichy and Saint Yorre, that it had acquired in its bruising bid battle for Perrier, one of France's best known water companies. Mr Vernes, chairman of the Vernes bank and the SCI investment concern, had been discussing the possible purchase of some of the brands under the Vichy umbrella, together with Mr Raul Gardini, the Italian businessman who is involved with SCI.

A dawn raid on a sleepy priory tucked into the old quarter of Nice ended more than 40 years on the run for France's last known World War II criminal at large. The gaunt, pajama clad old man taken away last May by police was Paul Touvier alias Lacroix, alias Berthet, alias Gaillard the former head of a pro Nazi militia unit based in Lyon to hunt down resistance fighters and Jews. Fifty years after war devastated Europe, Touvier's capture has rewakened terrible memories of France's collaboration with cruel and genocidal acts of its Nazi conquerers.

Raising the old bugaboo about Jewish control of the media while slamming Jews protesting the presence of a Carmelite convent at Auschwitz, Cardinal Glemp seems to have forgotten what happened to Jews there, just a short drive from Krakow.

Jews aren't about to let him forget the Nazi mass murders of their people, and that's right. It's their moral obligation, but they also must devote energy to memorializing the noble non Jews who risked their lives to protect Jews.

Touvier, whose trial starts Thursday in Versailles, west of Paris, will be the first French national to be tried for crimes against humanity. He is accused of ordering the reprisal execution of seven Jewish hostages on June 29, 1944 when he was intelligence chief of the pro Nazi French militia in the eastern city of Lyon.

President Francois Mitterrand has distanced himself from the modern French Socialist Party he founded and projected a new centrist image in his effort to defeat conservative Premier Jacques Chirac in the May 8 runoff. Mitterrand is very much an insider in French politics despite his leftist label. The bald, avuncular incumbent is a veteran of four presidential elections, has held many Cabinet posts and enjoys one of the highest status symbols in French society as a former fighter in the World War II resistance.

According to the magazine, the Department of French National Museums learned the works existed in 1975, but was not interested because the works did not come from national collections.

We searched our archives and did not find proof that the department had ever received a list of works from Berlin, Ms. Poujade said. Ms. Poujade said that French museums are considered depositories of state property which they are expected to conseve and display in good condition.

WHEN the votes were counted in the French National Assembly on Wednesday, Mr Philippe Seguin, the maverick champion of old style Gaullist values, was jubilant. In the quixotic hope of throwing out the Maastricht Treaty of European Union lock, stock and barrel, he had just delivered a mammoth diatribe, lasting nearly 2 1/2 hours, designed to prove the whole exercise was incompatible with the constitution and the soul of France. He failed by a wide margin but chalked up a bigger score than anyone expected.

He has made a harsh, brilliant picture one that's captivating about a character who, viewed from the most sympathetic angle, would seem disagreeable. Yet this woman, Marie Louise Giraud, carries historical significance, both as one of the last women to be executed in France and as a symbol of the Vichy government's hypocrisy. While Vichy collaborated with the Germans during World War II in the deaths of thousands of Resistance fighters and Jews, its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor.

She was untrained and, in one botched job killed a client. Her remorse was shallow and brief. Although she was kind and playful to her children, she was dreadful to her war damaged husband; she openly brought her lover into their home.

Her remorse was shallow and brief. Although she was kind and playful to her children, she was dreadful to her war damaged husband; she openly brought her lover into their home. As presented by Mr. Chabrol, and played with thin lipped intensity by Isabelle Huppert, Marie Louise (called Marie Latour in the film) was not a nice person.

Most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory.

I mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot, and this one has Gregory Peck, in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who wants to die the way he wants to die.
