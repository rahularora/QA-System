An American inventor and wildlife researchers at Kruger National Park say they have achieved a major breakthrough in conservation an immunization system that can stop epidemics in free ranging animals. The breakthrough is the bio bullet, a vaccine in a biodegradable projectile that can be fired by an air rifle from a helicopter. It has been used for three years to immunize animals ranging from warthogs to elephants against diseases that have nearly wiped out species in the park, a 7,800 square mile reserve.

The dog population in Kruger is one of the densest so far recorded in Africa, and the extensive network of roads is frequently used by packs on the move. 'Morning and evening are the best times to look for dogs,' Gus told me. 'That is when they hunt, for they rest in the heat of the day and then their low profile and disruptive coloration make them almost impossible to spot.

I found a dwarf mongoose den by the roadside and was able to watch the lightning activities of its delightful inhabitants as they foraged through the undergrowth and then rocketed across open areas for fear of raptors.

According to a paper to be published this week in Science magazine, a new finding by Montagnier points strongly to lab contaminations. Both sides now seem to agree that a particularly fast multiplying strain of the virus apparently contaminated samples in Montagnier's lab. Unaware the contamination had occurred, the French lab sent the samples to Gallo's lab.

Their spindly necks and legs belie the gracefulness they reach in the air, black spotted wings and outstretched bodies in effortless flight which concludes with a running splash in the shallow waters.

The remaining Arabian Tahr are found in the sultanate's northern Hajar mountain range and in mountains in the neighboring United Arab Emirates.

The big eared dogs have intricately patterned coats, each one distinct enough so individual animals can be identified from photographs. Once scientists know how many wild dogs there are and how they move, they will begin drawing up conservation plans. South Africa's National Parks Board and the private Endangered Wildlife Trust have started a contest to get tourists to take pictures of the animals and send the prints in with information on location, pack size and number of young.

An outbreak of anthrax in Kruger National Park has killed more than 200 animals, including buffalo, impala, jackals, lions and elephants, the park's head of research said. Vossie de Vos told the South African Broadcasting Co. on Tuesday that an innoculation campaign had started against the disease.

Actress Jessica Tandy, one of several artists supporting government financial support for the arts, says the movie for which she won an academy award this year owes a debt to the National Endowment for the Arts. The 80 year old performer, winner of the best actress award for her lead role in Driving Miss Daisy, told a congressional panel Tuesday that the movie was based on a 1987 play that had received money from the endowment. The endowment has come under close scrutiny since last year when conservative lawmakers pointed out that a few exhibits receiving NEA funds contained art that many would consider objectionable, sacrilegious or obscene.

The Himba, whom Louw pays to elect game wardens, have lived an isolated nomadic existence for centuries. When they came into contact with whites last century, some adopted Victorian dress which they have worn ever since. Others did not change their customs, but continued to coat their naked bodies in a beautifying and protective red dye.

Aristotle Onassis plotted with photographers to publish candid, nude photographs of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis so she would stop complaining about tamer shots taken by papparazzi, according to a new book. He figured if she appeared in the nude, nothing else they did could ever offend her again, the late lawyer Roy Cohn is quoted as saying in A Woman Named Jackie, an upcoming unauthorized biography of the former first lady written by C. David Heymann. It is being serialized in the weekly Star, a supermarket tabloid.

Woofling whistling music after Ennio Morricone; lunging visuals a la Sergio Leone; screen wide as a water melon slice; a girl; a town; a lot of chases; a crowning gunfight. Robert Rodriguez's El Mariachi touched its lighted cigar to festival fuses this year and blew several happy audiences, including mine at Berlin, right out of their seats. As often in cinema see Metropolis, Casablanca, L'Avventura, Airplane] the most ridiculous plots are the most inspired.

The activities at Abu's Camp are not restricted to elephant riding, and keen fishermen may take a mokoro (a canoe punted by a local guide) out on to the water where the catches can be prolific. Game drives are also on offer, and one afternoon I escaped with a driver and a safari truck to look for the wild dogs again.
