MR Manuel Esquivel, prime minister of Belize, is to ask Britain for further assurances of military support if the Central American country is threatened by neighbouring Guatemala. Mr Esquivel, who will visit Britain between Sunday and Wednesday of next week for discussions with government officials, said he was increasingly concerned at continued instability in Guatemala, where the congress and the supreme court have rejected a demand from President Ramon de Leon Carpio that they resign. 'All this could provide an opportunity for those elements in Guatemala which always want to raise the issue of Guatemalan claims to Belize,' Mr Esquivel said.

Belize says neighbouring Guatemala has revived its claim to Belizean territory, despite an interim agreement reached two years ago between the two Central American countries, Canute James reports from Kingston. The Belizeans say Guatemala's 130 year old claim was revived in a letter sent this month by the government to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, saying that an end to Guatemala's claim on the former British colony would come only with a final treaty. The latest Guatemalan statement coincides with the dismantling of a 1,500 strong British garrison which had been stationed in Belize to discourage the Guatemalan military from invading in pursuit of the territorial claim.

BFN [Text] Yesterday, in an appearance before the Congress of the Republic, Foreign Relations Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman confirmed that Guatemala still maintains its territorial claims over Belize and plans to allow the people to voice their opinion on the issue by means of a referendum. During a meeting with the Foreign Relations Committee, the minister explained that no unexpected readjustments to the guidelines of the dispute with the Belizean people are expected to take place during her term as minister and that they are prepared to resort to any legal means in order to resolve the dispute. As established by the Constitution, after the Belize Council has been established, one of the points to be put on its agenda will be to request the Supreme Electoral Tribunal to call the Guatemalan people to a referendum so they may voice their opinion on the issue.

GUATEMALA'S Congress has cleared the way for the resolution of a 130 year old territorial dispute with Britain and Belize, in which Guatemala was claiming the former British colony with which it has a common border, writes Canute James. Guatemalan legislators have ratified a recent ruling by a constitutional court supporting the decision of President Jorge Serrano to recognise Belize's political independence and to establish diplomatic ties between the two countries. The decision by the Congress is likely to end the dispute, although a referendum must be held in Belize before the treaty is ratified.

Until the dispute is settled, Guatemala cannot accept nor does it accept boundaries that are equidistant to states, adjacent coasts, or coasts that face each other if they negatively affect its sovereign right to 12 maritime miles, she emphasized. Ruiz said the government is willing to adopt control measures to prevent the violation of its laws and its customs, immigration, and health regulations. She confirmed that the country's economic zone comprises an area beyond its territorial sea and adjacent zones, which extend 200 maritime miles beyond the boundaries used to measure the width of its territorial sea.

She explained that she had stopped the organization from accepting inaccurate proposals that attempted to obtain statements of support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belize, thus, ignoring the existence of the territorial dispute. Confronted with such attempts, her delegation acted to safeguard the country's interests and was able to get the NAM Declaration to be more balanced, limiting it to calling upon Belize and Guatemala to discuss and resolve the dispute, which had not been achieved at this forum previously.

TWO important developments are putting strains on the traditional harmonious relations between Belize's diverse ethnic groups. In the last decade, the country has absorbed between 30,000 40,000 migrants, the equivalent of 20 per cent of its population, from elsewhere in central America. Meanwhile, emigration to the US continues among Creoles, the group that traditionally dominates the business and political elites.

The first of a string of Central American peace parks intended to save critical wilderness areas and end decades old border disputes has been launched in Costa Rica and Panama, officials said Wednesday. The park has been established in the misty mountains of the La Amistad Biosphere Reserve, which includes the largest tract of undisturbed cloud forest in Central America. The reserve straddles the border of Costa Rica and Panama.

THE Guatemalan government yesterday moved to tighten its control over the country, a day after President Jorge Serrano suspended the constitution and closed down congress and the supreme court. Although Mr Serrano said early on Tuesday that his move would not affect freedom of expression, the government was yesterday controlling radio and TV broadcasts. It has sent censors to monitor newspapers, while police surrounded the offices of the two largest morning papers.

THE award this month of the Nobel Peace Prize to one of the most vociferous opponents of the Guatemalan government has added to an array of problems faced by President Jorge Serrano. The government has been sharply criticised for its handling of the award to Ms Rigoberta Menchu, a human rights activist and an energetic critic of successive Guatemalan governments since she fled to Mexico in 1981, following the death of her father, mother, and brother at the hands of the armed forces. The government, seemed tobe caught unprepared, and was quickly forced into an embarrassing U turn.
