This is the final movement in the Voyager symphony of the outer planets, said Voyager project scientist Edward Stone, referring to Voyager's previous exploration of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. We're in for a good ride, and it's great everybody can share in the discoveries that are going to unfold in the next week, Stone said during a late morning news conference.

Stone said that on Jupiter, and possibly Neptune, the cloud bands help create the jet streams and then are blown by them. Jupiter's clouds are pushed to high altitudes by winds stirred up by heat within the planet. They try to fall back to lower elevations by moving north or south.

They try to fall back to lower elevations by moving north or south. But the planet's rotation deflects the falling clouds to form jet streams, he said. Voyager is still too far from Neptune to determine if the bands contain dark high altitude clouds or if they are broad ribbons of clear sky that allow Voyager to peer at dark clouds lower in Neptune's atmosphere, said Rich Terrile, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory astronomer.

Neptune usually is the eighth planet, but because of Pluto's elongated orbit Neptune will be the ninth and outermost until 2007. Scientists expect Voyager to discover at least 10 small moons, said deputy project scientist Ellis Miner. Some moons may confine or shepherd the 5 to 12 mile wide incomplete rings, called ring arcs, orbiting Neptune, said physicist Ed Stone, NASA's Voyager project scientist and a vice president at California Institute of Technology.

Up to four more active ice volcanoes on Neptune's moon Triton were discovered in snapshots taken by Voyager 2, which found the planet itself is swept by 1,500 mph winds the fastest yet seen in the solar system. Because the spacecraft photographed at least two and possibly five of the geyser like volcanoes erupting on only a portion of Triton, chances are that there are a dozen of these things going off globally at any time, said Torrence Johnson, a planetary scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. Confirmation of the first active volcano was announced Oct. 2 after scientists analyzed photos Voyager 2 snapped during its Aug. 24 25 flight past Neptune and Triton.

Voyager should be some 33,400 miles above Neptune's clouds when it crosses the ring region, so it is unlikely to be destroyed by an unseen arc, he said.

The spacecraft will measure gases that cause greenhouse effect warming of Earth's atmosphere, and study high altitude water vapor that helps create and destroy Earth's protective ozone layer, Johnson said. Galileo also will be the first spacecraft with modern instruments to study the far side of the moon, which is always pointed away from Earth, he added.

The Galileo space probe, heading for Jupiter on a six year roundabout journey, will fly past the planet Venus late Friday and early Saturday and gain momentum for the second leg of the trip back toward Earth. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said Galileo will be 10,028 miles above Venus' cloud tops when it makes its closest approach at 9:59 p.m. Pacific time, Friday. Although the space probe's instruments will be recording information about Venus Earth's closest planetary neighbor the data won't be played back for scientists until October.

Discovery of a magnetic field around Neptune suggests the planet is enveloped by radiation belts, but NASA hopes they won't damage the Voyager 2 spacecraft as it flies past the planet. Right now I don't think anyone is terribly alarmed, said Norm Haynes, Voyager project manager at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Similar radiation belts at Jupiter disrupted Voyager's internal clock, causing some of its instruments to make measurements at the wrong time.

NASA's Galileo spacecraft developed camera trouble today after zooming around cloud covered Venus in a celestial billiard shot that speeded the robot explorer toward its 1995 encounter with Jupiter. Although the glitch threatened to prevent Galileo from snapping five dozen more pictures of Venus tonight and next week, project scientist Torrence Johnson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said it should cause no permanent problems for the mission. Mission director Neal Ausman said the TV camera shutter, after taking 16 planned pictures of Venus early today, clicked open and closed 452 times, twice per minute, apparently because of faulty commands from the probe's main computer.

The 2.8 ton spacecraft made its closest approach to Venus at 9:59 p.m. PST Friday. It was supposed to pass 10,028 miles above the furnace like surface of the second planet from the sun, but actually came three or four miles closer, said mission science and design manager Bill O'Neil. We have clearly achieved the sole objective of going to Venus: a trajectory that will help us ultimately reach Jupiter, he said.

NASA scientists said Sunday they plan to launch the Rolls Royce of spacecraft from a space shuttle Oct. 12, catapulting the ship Galileo to Jupiter so it can parachute a probe into the giant planet's atmosphere. During its looping voyage toward a December 1995 rendezvous with Jupiter, the spacecraft will fly by Venus, pass Earth twice, see parts of the moon not seen since the early 1960s and make the first close approach to an asteroid, the researchers said. The swings past Venus and Earth will catapult the spacecraft to higher speeds so that it can reach Jupiter with the least expenditure of fuel, the researchers said.

Of particular interest will be the dynamics of a weather system that produce the ever changing bands, whirls and plumes seen from Earth and from the two Voyager spacecraft. The weather includes storms up to 25,000 miles across that have raged for centuries. Among them is the mysterious Great Red Spot, which the Voyagers determined is a tremendous atmospheric storm similar to Earth's hurricanes.

Among them is the mysterious Great Red Spot, which the Voyagers determined is a tremendous atmospheric storm similar to Earth's hurricanes. The Voyagers also found that Jupiter, 318 times more massive than Earth, is a whirling ball of mostly liquid hydrogen, topped by an atmosphere that is mostly hydrogen and helium.

The spacecraft Galileo grabbed Earth's gravity coattails Saturday and arced around the planet on a fleeting visit home 13{ months into a six year voyage to Jupiter. Taking pictures and exploring with instruments, Galileo used Earth as a gravity slingshot, hurtling 597 miles above the western Atlantic, the point of closest approach. The encounter, at 12:35 p.m. PST, increased the craft's speed by 11,600 mph, giving it a speed of 79,000 mph relative to the sun.

En route to the giant gaseous planet, Galileo will observe two asteroids.

Galileo's route to Jupiter was drastically redesigned and lengthened from three years to six because Earth and Jupiter are no longer aligned as ideally as they were in 1986 and because Galileo's new solid fueled booster is less powerful.

The Galileo space ship cruised on the next leg of its 2.4 billion mile, six year trip to Jupiter after engineers replaced faulty computer commands that made the craft act like a mad shutterbug. Galileo snapped 16 planned photos of Venus on Saturday, but for about five hours the shutter on the spacecraft's electronic camera opened and closed 452 times when it wasn't supposed to do so. None of those unintended exposures were recorded.

NASA has made that probe a high priority mission because the sun has been relatively neglected in space exploration.

The Voyager 2 spacecraft has discovered a 6,200 mile wide dark spot on Neptune, and scientists believe it's a giant storm similar to Earth's hurricanes and Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The width is about one fifth of Neptune's 30,700 mile diameter, just as the 16,000 mile wide Great Red Spot is about one fifth the size of Jupiter, said Andrew Ingersoll, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology. Voyager 2 was launched from Cape Canaveral in 1977, visited Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986.

We're trying to reshape the trajectory slightly so we move closer and closer to our aim point near Earth on Dec. 8, said Neal Ausman, mission director at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Galileo's tiny rocket thrusters, which are small enough to fit in the palm of a hand, started firing at 11:10 a.m. PDT and will fire roughly 3,000 times by the time the maneuver ends Saturday afternoon, laboratory spokesman Jim Wilson said.

Neptune's icy volcanic moon Triton is the coldest body ever measured in the solar system, NASA said Monday, and the planet itself has something in common with Los Angeles: smog. The Voyager 2 space probe also discovered auroras vaguely like Earth's northern lights on Neptune and Triton, scientists said. Looking backward 3.2 million miles, Voyager 2 on Monday snapped a series of family portraits of Neptune and Triton, appearing as crescents as they were backlighted by the sun.

Pioneer 10, the little spacecraft that won't quit, is still searching for a 10th planet five years after leaving the known solar system and 16 years after leaving the launch pad, NASA scientists said Monday. Disturbances in the orbits of Neptune and Uranus suggest that a mysterious Planet X may be orbiting beyond Pluto, John D. Anderson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said as NASA observed the fifth anniversary of Pioneer 10's dash past Pluto's orbit. Pioneer 10, launched in 1972 and now over 4 billion miles from home even though it was guaranteed for only 21 months, also is searching for long gravity waves proposed by Albert Einstein, and the boundary of the sun's influence.

One photo shows the crescent moon, while another shows Mare Orientale, a 550 mile wide meteorite impact crater on the far side of the moon, which is always pointed away from Earth. Because of the way the moon orbits Earth, only five eighths of its surface can be seen from Earth.

NASA has started testing sensors aboard Galileo, five days after the spacecraft successfully fired its thrusters for a second course correction on its journey to Venus and Jupiter. We're testing all of the scientific instruments to ensure they are ready to observe Venus when Galileo whizzes past the cloud shrouded planet Feb. 9, said Jim Wilson, spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. On Friday, Galileo fired its thrusters during a 2{ hour period so that it will fly about 6,200 miles above the Venusian cloudtops, Wilson said.

Since then, it has been sending back recorded photos that revealed Triton's volcanic activity. Soderblom compared the new type of ice volcanoes to sulfur spewing volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io. But he said the volcanoes on Triton are produced when liquid nitrogen in underground pools rises to the surface, where reduced pressure means it's got to explode and will shower ice particles and gas.

On Sunday, NASA also revealed more surprises about Triton's apparently inactive caldera like volcanoes, which measure up to hundreds of miles wide and fill with what Smith described as flows of viscous ice, possibly water ice, that gushes up from below.

So eruptions from Triton's calderas once produced a sea of ice like lava in repeated eruptions, resulting in massive, oceanic scale flooding, Soderblom said.

Smith said he believes the newly discovered nitrogen ice volcanoes erupted within the past century because they are located on Triton's huge south polar ice cap. A year on Neptune and Triton lasts about 165 Earth years. So if the ice cap had gone through a summer, evidence of volcanic deposits would have been erased as the ice cap receded, he added.

Astronomers at the U.S. Naval Observatory are narrowing their solar system search for a 10th planet, a mysterious, phantom giant that has long captured the speculation and interest of stargazers. Speculation about the existence of another planet evolved because something, perhaps a massive object orbiting the sun on the outer edge of the solar system, is giving a gravitational nudge that disrupts the predicted orbits of Uranus and Neptune, said astronomer R.S.
