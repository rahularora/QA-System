EDITOR'S NOTE The island of Madagascar split from the African mainland more than 150 million years ago and went on its own evolutionary course. But the island's many animals and plants which are found no place else in the world are now threatened with extinction by the encroachment of man. As smoke continues to rise from the dwindling forests, environmental groups are digging in to do battle.

This island off the East African coast is to today's naturalists what the Galapagos Islands off South America were to Charles Darwin, a study in evolution. But the island's unique and diverse plant and animal life is under grave threat as man continues to torch the forest to clear the land in what one newspaper calls a kind of national pyromania. As a result, heading off the destruction of Madagascar's fragile habitat has become the premier goal of many international environmental groups.

After Madagascar split from the African mainland more than 150 million years ago, its plants and animals went on their own evolutionary course. Some became extinct, like the pygmy hippopotamus, elephant bird and giant lemurs. There was a tremendous explosion of different forms from very, very few ancestors, says Dr. Martin Nicoll, a zoologist who represents the World Wildlife Fund here.

To get to the forest, near Mananara in northern Madagascar, an island country off the east coast of Africa, you need to hike three days, long and strong, Meier said. Nothing is dry after a few kilometers because you need to cross many big rivers and creeks containing leeches.

Environmentalists are mobilizing to save what is left of Brazil's once vast Atlantic forest, the nation's picture postcard front door. One of the species of trees near extinction is the brazilwood, or pau Brazil, which gave the country its name. When Portuguese explorers discovered Brazil in 1500, the Atlantic forest covered about 170,000 square miles along a 3,000 mile coastal strip.

He mentioned specifically the muriqui, South America's largest primate, of which fewer than 100 remain; the Golden Lion Tamarin, another endangered monkey, with about 400 left; the increasingly scarce red tailed parrot; the rare and valuable jacaranda tree, and the almost extinct pau Brazil. Today, with few exceptions, the only place you can still see pau Brasil is in a botanical garden, lamented Mesquita.

Seidensticker says brain studies have yielded evidence that certain kinds of large bats found in Africa and the South Pacific may be descendants of prehistoric primates akin to lemurs or mouselike shrews. The theory is that these bats are really flying primates, he says, and connected somehow in the evolutionary chain to the early primate ancestors of monkeys, apes, gorillas and humans. But Dr. Charles Handley, a leading authority on bats and other mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, says this theory is a hot potato of scientific controversy that has won few adherents.

It seems that tigers only attack their prey from behind. So three years ago, wildlife officials began issuing rubber face masks for Sunderbans workers to wear on the backs of their heads.

The Senate's rejection of tougher auto pollution controls deals environmentalists a setback on the compromise clean air bill. This is the one that we thought was the most significant of the attempts to strengthen the clean air bill in the Senate, said Richard Ayres, executive director of the Clean Air Coalition. By a 52 46 vote Tuesday night, the Senate defeated a proposal to require tougher tailpipe emission controls on automobiles, greater use of clean fuels by fleet operators and production of 1 million cars capable of burning alternative fuels.

A government trying to get a handle on how many of its citizens live in shadows and hideaways wrapped up an unprecedented 14 hour survey today to count the homeless. Offers of free meals, blankets and parties helped lure the homeless to counters carrying clipboards and flashlights.

The Bush administration was wrong to place so much importance on capturing Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega after U.S. troops invaded Panama, CIA Director William Webster says. Actually, Noriega was not a factor from the time the first paratrooper landed in Panama, Webster said Tuesday night during a question and answer session with students at American University. Webster's remarks seem to criticize President Bush, who made the arrest of the military leader the focal point of the invasion of Panama in December.

About 25,000 Namibians cheered wildly at a sports stadium as the South African flag was lowered in Africa's last colony just after midnight, replaced by the red, green and blue banner of newly independent Namibia.

Random House, 225 pp., $21; TWENTY years ago, Peter Mathiessen observed that of all the African animals the elephant was the most difficult for man to live with, but that its passing if this must come would be the most tragic of all. At that time, millions of elephants still roamed the bush and the forests of east, central and southern Africa, and the passing of the species seemed unlikely. Today, with its number authoritatively estimated at about 700,000, the African elephant is officially designated a threatened species.

For each species of plant or animal lost to extinction, you're losing the potential for another 20,000 to 30,000 variants in the future.

The destruction of millions of acres of tropical jungles each year by peasant farmers and others is a problem for the developed nations as well as the Third World and requires economic and educational solutions, say scientists at a leading plant research institution. The Missouri Botanical Garden, known for its man made tropical atmosphere in the so called Climatron designed by Buckminster Fuller, is working to halt the decimation of the world's real tropical jungles. The outlook is pretty grim, said biologist Peter H. Raven, director of the garden.

AFRICA'S blazing sun rarely penetrates the thick evergreen canopy of the Okumu rain forest, one of the last protected areas of primeval rain forest in Nigeria's southern equatorial belt. Amid huge mahoganies, irokos and other tropical hardwoods which stretch up to the light through dense green foliage, it is possible to imagine what it was like before man walked the earth. As you slash your way through matted vegetation, which appears to have rioted in a frenzy of anarchy, the stillness of the forest is suddenly broken by cracking branches.

Helicopters carrying water filled Bambi buckets have helped officials control a fire that threatened to destroy the world's first project to restore rare captive monkeys to the wild in Brazil. We were probably days away from the extinction of a species, said Benjamin Beck, associate director of the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The fire was fought with two helicopters belonging to the Brazilian federal police.

The chaotic development that is gobbling up the Amazon rain forest could finally be reined in with a new plan developed by officials of Amazon countries and leading scientists from around the world. That's some of the most encouraging news about the Amazon rain forest in recent years, said Thomas Lovejoy, a tropical ecologist at the Smithsonian Institution and an Amazon specialist. It contrasts markedly with a year ago, when there was nothing to read about conservation in the Amazon, especially in Brazil, except bad news, Lovejoy said in a recent interview.

From the Great Seal of the United States to the folklore of Native Americans, birds of prey have been powerful symbols of freedom, dignity and strength. But eagles, hawks and other raptors also send another message. Because of their position near the top of the food chain, they serve as environmental monitors, warning of impending danger like canaries in a coal mine.

The government has shifted course from the policies adopted in a 1975 socialist revolution and now follows the advice of Western donors on economic policy. But a U.S. embassy economic report says no economic reforms will work in the long run without corrective action against Madagascar's single greatest self inflicted problem: the destruction of its environment. The government also has broken out of the virtual self imposed isolation since President Didier Ratsiraka came to power in 1975.
