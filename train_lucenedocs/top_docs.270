THE Venezuelan cabinet approved at the weekend a Dollars 1.7bn heavy oil project to be carried out by Conoco, a subsidiary of EI du Pont, and Venezuela's national oil company, writes Joseph Mann in Caracas. The project calls for producing and upgrading very heavy crude oil from Venezuela's Orinoco oil belt, the world's largest known accumulation of heavy oil and bitumen. This is the first time a foreign company will be allowed to participate as a direct investor in Venezuela's oil production sector since the republic nationalised its petroleum industry in 1976.

Arco International Oil and Gas has signed a letter of intent with Corpoven, a subsidiary of PDVSA, Venezuela's national oil company, covering the development of a heavy oil project requiring total investments of Dollars 3.5bn. The plan is to produce and upgrade heavy crude oil from Venezuela's Orinoco Belt for export, reaching shipments of 200,000 barrels a day by 2004. The Orinoco Belt, located north of the Orinoco River, holds the world's largest known reserves of heavy oils and bitumen.

IN the mid 1980s, Venezuela's PDVSA and BP developed a new fuel called Orimulsion. Orimulsion, now registered by PDVSA as a trade name, is an emulsion made up of approximately 70 per cent natural bitumen by volume, and 30 per cent water, plus a surfactant, or additive to keep the mixture stable. It is being marketed as a fuel for electric power generation plants and other industrial facilities that generate power.

VENEZUELA'S national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), faces some serious difficulties which are not of its own making. PDVSA, with 1991 gross international sales of Dollars 22.3bn, is squeezed between weak oil prices and steep taxes and investment requirements. While the company remains well managed, efficient and profitable, the current situation has produced serious cash flow problems and has forced PDVSA to acquire nearly Dollars 5bn in debt, having been debt free only a few years ago.

The plan, which was announced by Mr Gustavo Roosen, president of national oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), assigns a key role to foreign investment in Venezuela's oil and gas sectors for the first time since the country nationalised all private oil companies in 1976. Of the Dollars 48.5bn in projected capital spending, PDVSA plans to invest Dollars 29.1bn or 60 per cent of the total directly, while private companies mainly foreign investors are expected to supply the remainder of about Dollars 19.4bn.

Until this moment, the minister has not ordered any increase and our production is still limited to our OPEC quota of 1.945 million barrels per day of crude, a ministry spokesman told The Associated Press. However, a new order could be given later on, depending on OPEC agreements, he added. Venezuela will not make any unilateral hikes, and in any case, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is awaiting word from Arab leaders on the success of their peace efforts before changing the level of output, the spokesman said.

Now, Mr. Perez envisions a major new role for foreign companies especially multinationals such as Exxon Corp. and Royal Dutch/Shell Group, with their technology and deep pockets in a $40 billion plus plan to speed development of Venezuela's vast energy base. The heart of the expansion plan is a 40% leap in oil producing capacity, a net gain of a million barrels a day, in just five years.

Still, with their reactivation by foreign firms, we expect to increase Venezuela's production by 150,000 to 200,000 barrels a day, says Celestino Armas, minister of energy and mines. One company interested in the fields is Benton Oil &amp; Gas Co. of California, a small oil and gas producer.

The current combination of stagnant world demand for oil and excess production capacity is forcing Venezuela to look beyond its oil sector for growth. The state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, has allocated more than $4.6 billion for 1986 90 to developing other energy resources such as petrochemicals, natural gas, coal and bitumen. For the same period, the company budgeted $4.7 billion for domestic oil exploration and development and $1 billion for upgrading oil refineries.

VENEZUELA'S production of crude oil in 1991 averaged 2.488m barrels a day, the highest level on record since the country's petroleum industry was nationalised in 1976, official sources said in Caracas. The 1991 production figure, which includes crude oil and small proportions of condensates and natural gas liquids, represents an increase of nearly 11 per cent over 1990 production of 2.249m b/d. Exports of crude oil and refined products in 1991 averaged 2.08m b/d, up more than 10 per cent from the previous year's average of 1.88m b/d.

The government is sponsoring a bill in Congress to permit foreign involvement in a proposed $3.5 billion liquefied natural gas project, Mr. Sosa Pietri said. That project, which is expected to require the development of offshore gas reserves, would be an important new outlet for Venezuela's 106 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Mr. Sosa Pietri said that five or six foreign companies have made firm offers to join a Petroleos affiliate in the project.

The resources are non renewable, and their exploitation is not worth the human sacrifice, and the extinction of fauna and flora we have not even begun to study. But the concerns of environmentalists may have become known too late. Signs in Puerto Ayacucho, the capital of the territory with a population of 40,000 along the Orinoco River, already advertise to buy gold.

Indians have moved to Puerto Ayacucho from their forest homes and roam the streets at night after frequenting drinking establishments. Much of the mining in the territory's national parks, especially in Yapacana Park at the confluence of the Orinoco and Ventuari rivers, is done by Indians, generally of the Piaroa and Guajibo ethnic groups, said Rafael Garcia of the National Parks Institute.

The Brazilians dredged riverbeds and cut down all vegetation within 600 feet of the river. Scientists estimated the damage would take hundreds of years to repair. The public outrage, not only over the environmental damage but the assault on national sovereignty, led for calls for the creation of a national park along the Sierra de Parima and the headwaters of the Orinoco, and the use of national guard troops and student volunteers to man the park system in Amazonas.

CSO <F P=106> [Article by Ana Diaz] </F> [Text] China is a very important client for sales of Orimulsion (R) and negotiations with Bitumenes del Orinoco (Bitor), PDVSA's [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.] marketing subsidiary for the fuel, have been concluded with agreement on the export to China of 5 million tons a year over the next five years, according to Carlos Borregales, the company's director. Beginning in 1995, the thermoelectric plant at Daga will use 1.2 million tons of the fuel. Borregales, together with the president of Intevep [Institute of Venezuelan Petroleum Technology], Gustavo Inciarte, and the manufacturing director of Venezuelan Petroleum, Otto Martinez, explained to the Finance Commission of the Senate, chaired by Virgilio Avila Vivas, measures taken by Venezuela to prevent protectionist treatment against Orimulsion (the United Kingdom) and reformulated gasolines (the United States).

It will install a new smokestack scrubber to reduce emissions produced from burning the bitumen, which has a high sulfur content. Orimulsion is a mixture of water and extra heavy bitumen, a tarlike crude.

But analysts say that the revision, which on paper catapults the South American nation to fourth place from No. 10 in oil reserves world wide, is unlikely to make much headway in persuading its OPEC partners to give it a bigger share.

The UK took an internal policy problem to the European Union and requested that Orimulsion, a new fuel developed by Venezuela, be inaccurately classified. [end recording]

Re your May 1 article, U.S. Begins to Take Notice as Venezuela Lifts Its Estimate of Proven Oil Reserves : Not long ago Venezuela was the prime stereotype of an old played out oil province. Reserves were running out, as all over the world; soon we would be back begging at the Persian Gulf. But the running out of reserves reflected only the lack of an inducement to invest.

A military transport plane crashed and exploded in the hills west of the capital shortly after takeoff Tuesday morning, killing all 24 people aboard, officials said. Investigators said fog and rain was probably to blame for the crash of the Spanish built twin engine Aviocar, which was carrying 13 Venezuelan navy men, eight civilians and three crew. Rescue officials said the craft, en route to a port on the Orinoco River, crashed just outside the hamlet of La Sabaneta (Little Blanket) 15 miles west of Caracas.

The world oil glut has suddenly got bigger, postponing the day of any severe shortages into the next century. Based on authoritative new estimates, proved international oil reserves increased spectacularly within the past year as much as 190 billion barrels, or 27%, despite the drilling downturn. That's enough new oil to satisfy global needs for an additional nine years, based on current use of 20 billion barrels annually.

All the agreements that the Venezuelan Government has to establish with the Brazilian Government should include a specific agreement with the Roraima State Government, because we believe Roraima State has become an excellent supply center, or logistics support center, for illegal miners, meaning the garimpeiros. In addition, this has to be discussed at length because the latest information we have, based on investigations that have been conducted, is that the garimpeiros are not just involved in illegal gold mining activities. They also act as scouts and guard beachheads for drug trafficking activities, and the illegal landing strips built by them are later used for drug trafficking.

National Power, the electricity generation company, is to apply for government permission to build equipment which will enable it to burn Orimulsion, the controversial bitumen based fuel, at its Pembroke plant in west Wales. The company's application, expected to be lodged within weeks, is a blow to providers of other fuels including coal and gas. Burning Orimulsion at Pembroke could displace up to 5m tonnes of coal a year.

Venezuela's national oil company has developed a programme to open its exploration and production sectors to private capital for the first time since the oil industry was nationalised in 1976. Petroleos de Venezuela, PDVSA, plans to seek tenders on profit sharing contracts, under which private companies will be allowed to explore about 10 geographical areas onshore and offshore. Successful companies must finance all exploration themselves.

A prominent National Guard official, who has been working against drug traffickers for several years, has reported: People don't talk about them because they fear retributions, but seeing how the drug traffickers are increasing their ties in the region and apprehensive that their quiet existence in the Amazons may turn into violence like in Colombia, they are now cooperating and we have been informed of the drug traffickers' paths in the south.

CSO [Excerpt] The two major projects to modernize and expand the production capacity of the Amuay and Cardon refineries, which will make it possible to increase production of reformulated gasoline by 100,000 barrels per day, call for investment of 130 billion bolivars this year, according to a PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.] report which includes additional information about other aspects of this industry in Venezuela. The report says: The dynamics of the market for hydrocarbons, the new environmental regulations of the industrialized countries, and the premise that we will continue to be a top oil producing country lead PDVSA to continue to plan considerable investments in the medium and long term to upgrade its national refineries in order to adapt the variety of refined products Venezuela sells to the changing demands of the world market. In most industrialized countries, the governments have established deadlines for compliance with environmental protection standards without reducing gasoline octane ratings.

BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 19 April. A study by oil specialist Leonardo Montiel Ortega indicates Venezuelan refineries overseas, far from being profit makers, produce net losses of more than $96.3 million. These losses are due to the $.86 price differential at which Venezuela sells its crude to the refinery Citgo in the United States.

A South Carolina newsprint manufacturer is planning a joint venture with a Canadian company to build and manage a $350 million newsprint plant in northeast Venezuela, officials say. Bowater Inc., whose pulp and paper group is headquartered in Greenville, is working on an agreement with Abitibi Price Corp. of Toronto that should be completed this month. Bowater and Abitibi Price each will control 24.25 percent of the plant, and the Venezuelan government will control the rest, said Bowater spokesman Arthur King.

Venezuela ordered the state owned oil monopoly Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) to start placing extra petroleum on the market, company president Arturo Sosa Pietri said Thursday. He said PDVSA was ordered Wednesday afternoon by the government to begin selling additional oil above the country's OPEC quota of 1.94 million barrels per day. At a ceremony to celebrate the oil monopoly's 15th anniversary, he also hinted that Venezuela's oil supply should be considered as an energy alternative to oil from the Middle East.

They had to paddle 200 miles upstream on the Paraguay River in Brazil because high winds had blown water plants into a solid mass that blocked their path, and later spent 17 days without touching shore on the same river because of floods. From the Arctic Circle to Asuncion they logged more than 17,000 miles, leaving about 4,000 miles to go around Cape Horn to Punta Arenas.

It was sunny, but chilly, on Monday when about 100 well wishers saw them off. Their planned route is down the Paraguay, south on the Parana to Buenos Aires, then down Argentina's Atlantic Coast to the Straits of Magellan and around the cape to Punta Arenas.

CSO <F P=106> [Article by Adela Leal] </F> [Text] The failure of shareholders to make the capital investments required to undertake new projects and expand others, and the management's inability to make the necessary corrections to adapt to new market conditions are the main causes of the deep crisis that has the basic enterprises in the Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana (CVG) holding company on the verge of collapse. This assessment can be deduced from the report by an ad hoc congressional committee that looked into the financial statements of the enterprises from 1987 to 1992. The committee was chaired by Deputy Ramon Jose Medina, who was accompanied by Abdon Vivas Teran (the current minister president of the FIV [Venezuelan Investment Fund]), Gustavo Marquez, Freddy Lepage, Rafael Rodriguez Acosta, Amarilis Valor, Ildemaro Martinez, and Margot Siso.

VENEZUELA'S decision to allow private companies to produce oil from a series of inactive fields is not only an important break with the past but also the first concrete example of private capital investment in the oil production sector since the country's petroleum industry was nationalised in 1976. Mr Alirio Parra, energy and mines minister, announced on June 19 that Royal Dutch/Shell and smaller companies from Japan, the US and Venezuela would invest Dollars 720m (Pounds 390m) over the next 10 years to produce crude from five groups of inactive fields. The private companies are assuming the entire financial risk no oil, no return.

All output will be turned over to subsidiaries of Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA.

Soldiers raided illegal gold mines in the Amazon jungle and arrested more than 300 people, mostly foreigners, Foreign Minister Reinaldo Figueredo said Saturday. Most of the illegal miners detained in last week's raids were taken to Puerto Ayacucho, a jungle outpost on the Orinoco River about 400 miles south of Caracas, where they were to be tried on charges of damaging the environment, authorities said. Since last year, the federal government has made more than 1,000 arrests in attempting to staunch an invasion of miners crossing the unmarked jungle border between Brazil and Venezuela.

The Venezuelan government announced a single exchange rate of 170 bolivars to the US dollar late on Tuesday, following more than a week of deliberations on new foreign exchange controls. On June 23, the last day of trading, the bolivar stood at about 200:Dollars 1, down from 106 at the end of 1993. The imposition of exchange controls came after months of heavy pressure on Venezuela's international reserves, caused by a crisis in the banking system, much rumour and a marked deterioration in the economy.
