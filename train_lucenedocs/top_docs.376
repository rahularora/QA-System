This Media General Associated Press poll is based on telephone interviews Nov. 10 20 with 1,084 adults in the continental United States. The phone numbers were selected randomly by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.

The phone numbers were selected randomly by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a 3 point margin of error, meaning that if every adult American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20.

As a substitute for the Republican plan for a tax cut that would raise federal revenues, House Democrats are now officially offering a plan for a tax increase. Revenues aside, they just prefer high taxes. Democrats of the now dominant variety may have to agree that cutting the capital gains tax to 19.6% would raise revenues in the initial year (in our view also over the long term).

As it has developed over the past few months, the battle over a capital gains cut has produced for the American electorate a rare opportunity to understand the two ideologies now competing for their assent. Turning the 33% proposal into law would not only bust George Bush's promise not to raise taxes but also would displace the competing philosophy of government established by Ronald Reagan over the eight years of his presidency.

Turning the 33% proposal into law would not only bust George Bush's promise not to raise taxes but also would displace the competing philosophy of government established by Ronald Reagan over the eight years of his presidency. The House Democrats have decided conclusively that the party's identity will sink or swim on the issue of taxes.

The House Democrats have decided conclusively that the party's identity will sink or swim on the issue of taxes. They want more. The Democrats believe that the government is the most important institution in the nation's life, that the government exists to create programs and raise whatever taxes are necessary to fund those programs.

The Democrats believe that the government is the most important institution in the nation's life, that the government exists to create programs and raise whatever taxes are necessary to fund those programs. It is really the most remarkable thing to see one of this country's major political parties espousing such a vision in the late 20th century.

By contrast, Ronald Reagan's support for tax cuts and his opposition to increased federal spending were based on his belief, stated at every opportunity, that the federal government and its great panoply of programs were smothering private initiative in the United States.

Americans overwhelmingly favor the U.S. Soviet medium range nuclear missile treaty but share fears in Congress that Moscow cannot be trusted to comply, according to a Media General Associated Press poll. The poll also found that Americans view Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev nearly as favorably as they do President Reagan, and Gorbachev out polls Reagan among college educated Americans. Seventy three percent of those polled in the national survey supported the accord to eliminate medium range missiles, and as many said they would back a treaty to cut each nation's long range arsenal in half.

Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's opponents scorned what they called a cynical offer to negotiate his resignation and kept Panama shut down Tuesday with a general strike intended to force him out. An estimated 90 percent of offices and industries were shut by the strike, which appeared to be gaining support on its second day. Most shops and stores were closed, public transportation was halted and many government employees did not go to work.

As George Bush seeks to overcome his negative ratings in presidential campaign polls, he might draw hope from recent history: Ronald Reagan suffered equally low ratings in his races and overcame them to win. But this year there is an important difference, poll analysts say. While Reagan won by beating opponents who were viewed even less favorably than he was, Bush faces a far more popular opponent in Gov.

When President Bush looks for votes on Capitol Hill to sustain a minimum wage bill veto or win passage of his savings and loan bailout plan, his clout is limited by the fact most congressmen ran far ahead of him in their districts last November. House members and political analysts differ among themselves on the impact of Bush's lack of coattails. But there is no argument that while Bush was carrying 40 of the 50 states, voters by the millions were opting for divided government by choosing a Republican president and a Democratic Congress.

President Daniel Ortega has accused the United States of ordering thousands of rebels to re enter Nicaragua and sabotage reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Joan. Meanwhile, it was reported today that some U.S. charities trying provide humanitarian relief to Nicaraguans hurt by the hurricane claim they are being hampering in their efforts by the Reagan administration. Taking advantage of the damage, the trauma, the Yankees have already ordered the infiltration of 3,000 mercenaries into Nicaraguan territory, Ortega said Friday in a nationwide radio and television address.

Americans want the United Nations, not national governments, to control nuclear and chemical weapons and to take the lead in keeping peace in the world, according to a poll released Wednesday.

In conflicts among countries where the United States has an interest, U.N. forces should be used in an effort to accommodate all parties, said 49 percent of the nearly 2,000 adults surveyed.

The Defense Forces of Panama have orders to refrain from using lethal or destructive weapons at any time against the armed forces of the United States or against U.S. civilians or against property or installations of citizens or the government of the United States, the communique says.

The U.S. economy during the 1980s was a study in contrasts: the deepest recession since the Great Depression followed by the longest peacetime economic expansion in history. It was a decade in which the spiraling inflation, economic stagnation and successive oil shocks of the 1970s were replaced by new headaches huge budget and trade deficits, and fears the United States was becoming a second rate economic power. It was the decade when Americans went on a spending spree, financed by foreign capital.

The president said the legislation could have damaged U.S. relations with China, which has condemned the action and threatened to curtail exchange programs if it becomes law. The Senate voted 62 37 Thursday to override the presidential veto, four votes short of the two thirds necessary.

The statement referred to Reagan's obsession with the space based defense system known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, and said the signatories were upset at the wars he has promoted in Central America, the bombing of Libya, the invasion of Grenada and the sending of troops to the Middle East . We call for the U.S.A. to announce a disarmament program and to cease interfering in the affairs of other countries, the statement said.

Shultz said Wednesday. The idea is to prevent hostage holders from taking off with their victims, Shultz said in a U.S. Information Agency telecast and at a White House news conference.

Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said Friday that Oliver North was the scapegoat for crimes committed by the U.S. government and the person who really should be tried is former President Reagan. North was convicted Thursday of three felony counts in connection with the Iran Contra case, which shadowed the last two years of the Reagan administration. Ortega, on a swing through Western Europe, also told a news conference that he hoped to improve relations with Washington.

EDITOR'S NOTE Elliott Abrams is a man not given to compromise or mincing his words. That has made him a sizable band of political enemies, especially in his handling of Central American policy, where the administration's efforts have not notably prospered. Undaunted, the assistant secretary for inter American affairs means to soldier on until the end of President Reagan's term.

Elliott Abrams is Ronald Reagan's point man in the one area where the president's vaunted good luck seems to have deserted him. On no issue have Reagan's policies come under more sustained assault than in Central America Abrams' turf but Abrams' campaigns against cocaine smugglers and what he considers Cuban style communism there haven't gotten very far. In the process, he has become a lightning rod for policy opponents' wrath, and he has often found himself the target of corrosive taunts on Capitol Hill and in the bureaucracy as well.
