However, the acquisitions did include other units, such as a plastic molding business, which have been sold previously. But analysts consider Clorox's performance in the paint business mediocre. The two businesses were almost destined to fail, says James Wilbur, analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham &amp; Co. One reason, he suggests, was Clorox's marketing approach that put too much emphasis on advertising brand names.

Contemporaries called Meurent 'a female gorilla' and marched through the Salon with sticks and umbrellas to attack her portrait.

The top price was $119,000 for a painting of a fish wearing a rope of pearls by the Belgian surrealist, Rene Magritte.

The chimera that artists, especially younger ones, no longer paint, or if they do they certainly do not paint people, hovers over much current chatter about the visual arts. It is, of course, so much nonsense. The human figure is still the chosen subject of many young painters, although they may not approach it in the traditional manner of, say, Lucien Freud, whose lifetime contemplation of the model in the studio will be celebrated at the Whitechapel Gallery this autumn.

A 1942 Diego Rivera portrait of a Mexican woman burdened with a huge basket of flowers brought a record $2.9 million at Christie's International PLC's major Latin American auction in New York, and record prices were paid for works by more than a dozen other Latin American artists. The interest in Latin American art comes at a time when the auction houses are eager to find a new hot market amid the slump in Impressionist and other traditional art markets. While the auction houses have been phenomenally successful in selling collectibles lately, toys, rock n' roll memorabilia and comic books only fetch so much.

There's bunting everywhere, shining in the still familiar clean aqua, hot magenta and rich chrome yellow hues said by the planners of the 1984 Games to represent the Southern California spirit. Brightly colored pennants hang on the walls between billboards promoting spark plugs, chewing tobacco and bail bond agencies. The faded, scratched victory stands, which still have the Olympic rings and star symbols visible, are planted in the race track infield amid plastic pink flamingoes.

The theft of Norway's most famous work of art took a bizarre twist this week when two ex communicated, anti abortion activist priests from the country's state Lutheran church hinted they may be connected to the crime. Edvard Munch's 'The Scream' was stolen last Saturday from Norway's National Gallery in Oslo. The painting had been moved to the first floor of the gallery to allow easier access to a collection of Munch's emotionally charged works during a special exhibition coinciding with the Lillehammer Winter Olympics.

The public reaction to the work of young artists can provide a measure of our response to the complex and difficult universe of modern art. Perhaps because their work is by definition 'unknown', its display can give licence to express an underlying anxiety about the contemporary art world, that perplexing place where constant contradictions reduce even sophisticated and erudite commentators to occasional bursts of bile and which nevertheless these novitiates still choose to enter. Their work bears the burden of our own anxiety, wary consumers, faced with a new and unknown product.

The sunflower painting was acquired by Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. of Tokyo. The bridge painting, in muted grays and blues, is an extremely subtle and quiet painting that requires contemplation, Mr. Burge said. Nonetheless, Christie's expects this work easily to exceed the second highest price ever paid for a work of art, $11 million, in December for a painting by Edouard Manet.

Roy Miles has the leading contemporary Russian artist, Sergei Chepik, who works in a traditional format, while Marlborough Graphics is offering new etchings on the theme of nursery rhymes by Paula Rego. Anyone wanting to see the cutting edge of contemporary art can visit the Tate, where the short listed artists for the Turner Prize are currently on show, but in the main this is a time of retrenchment, of massaging back to life nervous traditional buyers while hoping that enough of the new rich, who are surely out there, will catch the collecting bug. The art world has experienced so many false dawns of a market revival that it has almost given up hope of a substantial upturn.

Over time, the siding's paint weathers, developing a dead pigment layer on the surface. Particles of dead paint are washed off by rain and accumulate along the siding's bottom edges. ; Wash the siding periodically with a solution of 1/3 cup detergent, 2/3 cup triphosphate (such as Soilax), 1 quart Clorox and 3 quarts of warm water.

A 19th century painting set in ancient Rome of a young woman about to bathe has been sold at auction for $153,450 nearly 20,000 times its 1956 purchase price of $8. It certainly does reflect an extraordinary change in taste, but that isn't unique in art, said Sotheby's Simon Taylor after the sale Tuesday of Diadumene by Sir Edward Poynter. The auction house had expected more because of the vogue for once neglected Victorian works.

Christie's auction house held its first ever sale of Spanish paintings on Friday, and a lighthearted picture within a picture fetched the highest individual price of $233,000. The 170 paintings from the 19th and 20th centuries reaped a total of $2.1 million, with prices well beyond expectations, said a Christie's statement. The most expensive work, Raimundo de Madrazo y Garreta's En El Estudio (In the Studio), reverses the role of portraiture, Christie's said.

Clorox Co. said Henkel Corp., a unit of Henkel KGaA of West Germany, is converting its $9 million of 12% Clorox subordinated debt into 1.2 million common shares. The transaction increases to 26.5% from about 25% Henkel's stake in Clorox's shares outstanding. Clorox, a maker of household grocery and food service products and architectural paints and stains, said Henkel's move is consistent with the West German company's previously stated goal of increasing its Clorox ownership to 30%.

More than 750 objects never intended for a museum gallery are being displayed at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis as part of the Graphic Design in America show that opened Nov. 5 and will travel to New York, Phoenix and London after its debut. The magazines, newspapers and maps; banners, buttons and flags; film and television clips; posters, signs and symbols; and trinkets from Andrew Jackson's presidential campaign, the 1939 World's Fair and the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics were designed to make a quick impact before being discarded. Graphic design deals with information that's not meant to be preserved forever, except if it's in books, said Walker design curator Mildred Friedman, who organized the show.

<P> Jerald Silva's masterfully painted watercolor nudes are caught somewhere between Ingres' psychological portraits and strictly formal figure studies toying with light, form and technique. Confusion arises because the female figures are so often bland individuals at the mercy of the artist's technical display. Yet occasionally they survive the assault with dogged inner strength.

WHAT DID Titian feel in the autumn of 1510 on hearing that Giorgione had died of plague? Perhaps he mourned for 'Big George' who, as Vasari wrote, 'taught everything he knew with love' and revolutionised painting in Venice, even though he was still in his early 30s when he died. Yet Titian must have reflected that there now was no rival to stand in the way of his acceptance as supreme painter of Venice.

Room after room of the Grand Palais is hung with masterpieces from Venice's golden age, among them some of the best loved paintings of the Italian Renaissance, such as Titian's 'Flora' from the Uffizi and his 'Venus at her Toilette' from Washington. Titian dominates, but this is not to say that it is his show alone. The Royal Academy's Splendour of Venice in 1983 4 produced not one Giorgione, but some fine paintings from his circle.

A private Latin American collector paid nearly $25 million at auction for an early Pablo Picasso painting of a mother kissing her son's upturned face, setting a record for a 20th century work of art. Maternity, from the artist's blue period, sold Monday at Christie's for twice its estimate, making it the third highest price ever paid for a work of art, behind Vincent Van Gogh's Irises and Sunflowers. The 1901 oil on canvas was one of 28 post Impressionist and modern works on sale from the collection of William Goetz, a Hollywood motion picture executive, and his wife Edith, the daughter of film mogul, Louis B. Mayer.
