A single round of treatment with an experimental new medicine appears to be highly effective against a rare form of leukemia and may help fight other kinds of blood cancer as well, says a study published today. The new drug was developed at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif., where doctors tested it on patients with hairy cell leukemia. In almost every case, the medicine erased all signs of the disease.

Dr. Kinlen, who directs the university's Cancer Epidemiology Unit, examined leukemia deaths from a U.S. study that had tracked veterans' smoking between 1954 and 1969. The earlier study tallied overall deaths from various causes, including 723 deaths due to leukemia. Dr. Kinlen found veterans who had smoked more than 21 cigarettes a day were the most likely to die from myeloid leukemia, the most common form of the disease in middle aged people.

A form of blood cancer that strikes children appears to be sometimes linked with genetic damage that hinders the body's ability to make interferon, according to a study published today. The researchers speculate that genes that oversee the body's production of interferon, a disease fighting substance, may play a role in warding off the development of cancer. The researchers speculate that the interferon genes may act as regulators that stop the body's cells from becoming cancerous.

The death rate from leukemia was nearly 60 percent higher among smokers of more than 10 cigarettes a day than among non smokers, according to a study published Friday. While no direct link has been established between smoking and leukemia, research published in the British Medical Journal showed that the leukemia death rate among people who smoked fewer than 10 cigarettes a day was 34 percent higher than among non smokers. For smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day it was 57 percent, and for smokers of 21 or more cigarettes 63 percent, the study showed.

His research is part of a new effort by scientists to find a role for interferon by combining it with the drugs that have long been used to attack cancer. Oken said interferon might provide a knockout punch after cancer has been weakened, but not destroyed, by medicines. The work may also represent a revival of the fortunes of interferon, which has been on a roller coaster of public acclaim and disdain for a decade.

Chemotherapy drugs that were used to treat ovarian cancer may have sharply increased the risk of leukemia, a study has found. Researchers found that among women treated between 1960 and 1985, the risk of leukemia was 12 times higher in those who received chemotherapy rather than surgery alone, according to the study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. Although the study did not measure the benefits of treatment, chemotherapy drugs given during that time frequently failed to stop ovarian cancer.

Alpha interferon, a natural disease fighter already used to treat leukemia, can now be used to battle Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that primarily attacks AIDS patients. The Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that alpha interferon was shown in tests to be effective against Kaposi's and now is approved for treatment of the cancer that has become common among AIDS victims. Alpha interferon is a disease fighter that is present in the body naturally in small amounts, but has been artifically produced in large quantities in recent years through the use of gene splicing techniques.

Once those are done, it will begin a larger review of its effectiveness. Though the synthetic vitamin wiped out obvious signs of the leukemia, the disease frequently came back, apparently because some cancer cells were resistant to the drug. Degas said it may be necessary to combine the treatment with standard chemotherapy to try to obliterate the few remaining cancer cells.

Excess mortality due to leukemia and Hodgkin's disease in young people who lived near potential sites was similar to that in young people who lived near existing sites, researchers wrote. Ms. Darby said: There was a 16 percent increase in childhood leukemia mortality in areas near nuclear installations compared with the rest of the country after adjusting for factors such as urban rural status.

When the same analysis was carried out for areas near potential installations, there was a 14 percent increase. We carried out this study because estimates of radiation received by children living near nuclear installations are extremely low, and it has been suggested that increases in the number of deaths are not caused by the presence of the installations, but by some other feature of the districts in which they tend to be built, she said.

Researchers, using an intricate manipulation of genes and transplantation of bone marrow, have produced a mouse that suffers from a vicious form of human leukemia, giving scientists a new way to test therapies against the killer disease. In a report to be published Friday in the magazine Science, researchers at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research said they have discovered a way to give chronic myelogenous leukemia, CML, to laboratory mice. CML is a form of leukemia that usually attacks adults and is only rarely cured.

More evidence emerged that a cancer virus is contaminating the nation's supply of banked blood. Researchers in New York City reported evidence that some hospital patients who had received multiple blood transfusions had been infected with the virus. This follows other, tentative reports in recent months hinting that 1% to 4% of blood donors in some localities and as many as 9% of drug addicts tested in New York City may be infected with the virus.

Researchers are quietly conducting a large scale sampling of the nation's blood supply to see if a rare virus capable of causing cancer and, possibly, a mysterious nerve disease is being spread among Americans. The virus, until now, has been confined to small areas of Japan, the Caribbean and the Mediterranean. It is, however, similar to the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS.

Now, scientists are increasingly concerned that the virus, which can cause a form of adult leukemia, is being transmitted like AIDS: through an exchange of blood by hypodermic syringes, sexual practices or transfusions.

Scientists say they took a step toward improving bone marrow transplants for people with cancer and radiation sickness by purifying, or isolating, a type of cell crucial to development of blood and immunity in mice. Isolation of the special cell type, called a stem cell, eluded researchers for 30 years until achieved by doctors at Stanford University Medical Center in Northern California and Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia. The research is outlined in Friday's issue of the journal Science.

Researchers have been unable to definitively link fallout from atomic explosions in Nevada during the 1950s to the higher than normal leukemia rate in neighboring Utah, although a new study does suggest a link. Weapons tests in Nevada by the old U.S. Atomic Energy Commission may have caused the higher cancer rate in the neighboring state, but the evidence is weak, according to a study conducted by University of Utah researchers to be published in next week's Journal of the American Medical Association. The excess of acute leukemias in southwestern Utah is probably not due to chance and may be attributable to fallout radiation.

Dr. Peters's work adds to the body of evidence that some still unexplained process may be increasing the risk of cancer, said George Hidy, who heads the environment division of the Electric Power Research Institute, an industry financed group that paid for the study. The results of the University of Southern California study had been widely awaited because of a large sample size some 232 children with leukemia and an equal number of healthy children as well as detailed readings of electrical and magnetic fields that were a part of the research's design. But while the research appeared to offer important affirmation that physical proximity to electrical transmission equipment may increase the risk of leukemia, it didn't answer why.

A lot of people die of pneumonia, says Dr. Golde, the UCLA researcher, who is working with GM CSF.

Thirty five million Americans report suffering from arthritis and 6 million admit they haven't seen a doctor about it, according to a nationwide survey released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control. People are seeing (pain killer) ads on TV and treating their arthritis themselves and very possibly doing damage to themselves, said Steve Erickson, spokesman for the Arthritis Foundation. The problem will probably get worse if pain relievers are the only treatment, he said.

At least 14 deaths and 1,269 cases of a rare, painful blood disorder known as eosinophilia myalgia syndrome have been attributed to the health food supplement L tryptophan, the Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday. The disorder, marked by an abnormally high number of white blood cells, causes severe muscle pain and can cause death. The median time between use of L tryptophan and the onset of symptoms was 152 days.

Researchers using an intricate manipulation of genes and transplantation of bone marrow have produced a mouse that suffers from a vicious form of human leukemia, giving scientists a new way to test therapies against the killer disease. In a report to be published Friday in the magazine Science, researchers said they have discovered a way to give chronic myelogenous leukemia, CML, to laboratory mice. CML is a form of leukemia that usually attacks adults and is only rarely cured.

A study of airline cabin environment found that, even with the smoking ban that takes effect in 10 days, passengers and crew still face a health risk from increased radiation from the sun and stars. The study released Thursday by the Transportation Department recommends that airlines schedule cabin crews in ways that will reduce their risk to cosmic radiation, especially those crews who regularly fly near the North Pole and South Pole or at higher altitudes. The study found the risk of cancer death from cosmic radiation comparable to the risk of death from exposure to smoke filled cabins, although estimates of cancer caused by cosmic rays had a wider range because of uncertainty over the effects of low doses of radiation.

Lyon, an University of Utah epidemiologist who is working on the current study, published a paper showing a 2.4 fold increase in childhood leukemia in the areas of southern Utah heavily dusted by fallout. Meanwhile, nearly 1,200 people living downwind of the tests sued the federal government, claiming that exposure to fallout caused sickness and death. In 1982, U.S. District Judge Bruce Jenkins ruled the government had failed to warn residents of radiation hazards.

If the finding can be translated into drugs to treat humans, an expert said, it would be of tremendous benefit to cancer patients who now must endure the characteristic mark of chemotherapy baldness. Yunis said his team made the discovery while testing cancer fighting drugs on lab rats that had been injected with leukemia cells. Half of the rats were treated with a drug called cytosine arabinoside, or ARA C. The rest were treated with a combination of ARA C and an experimental drug called ImuVert.

The Food and Drug Administration is allowing wider distribution of a leukemia drug that has been shown effective in patients who aren't helped by other treatments, an FDA spokesman said Tuesday. The drug, fludarabine phosphate, is being used to treat patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which is the most common form of adult leukemia. The drug is believed to slow or interrupt reproduction of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow, blood and liver of people with the disease.

A college student with leukemia whose search for a compatible bone marrow donor drew celebrity support and 50,000 volunteers underwent a last ditch transplant using her mother's marrow. Allison Atlas, 20, opted for the surgery Thursday although her mother's tissue is not a perfect match. She said she wanted to try the life saving procedure while she was still relatively strong.

A biologist said Wednesday that a newly discovered herpes virus spread by casual contact might be a sixth cancer causing virus and appears to work with the AIDS virus in wiping out the immune system of AIDS victims. Robert Gallo, the National Cancer Institute's chief of tumor cell biology, said more evidence was needed before the highly contagious Herpes 6, or human B lymphocyte virus, could be blamed for causing certain types of cancers. Gallo spoke at the annual meeting of the American Society for Microbiology, which convened here Sunday.

The rate of leukemia among young people living near a nuclear complex in a barren area of northern Scotland is nearly twice Britain's national rate, a report published today says.

This is twice the number expected on the basis of the national rate, the report says, adding that the likelihood of such a high rate occurring by chance is about one in 12.
