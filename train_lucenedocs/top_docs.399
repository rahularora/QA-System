The British pound surged in a powerful rally yesterday, as the Bank of England abandoned a long struggle to contain the currency's value in favor of a more anti inflationary strategy. The pound was quoted at $1.8182 in late New York trading yesterday, up 2.5% from $1.7745 Friday. Traders attached more significance, however, to sterling's breakthrough above the 3.00 West German mark level.

Profit hungry currency traders this week will be focusing on the British government to see if it finally acts to keep a lid on its fast rising currency. The British pound already has climbed 5% against the dollar and 2.8% against the West German mark in the past seven trading days. So dealers and analysts are trying to guess at what point the British government will do something to stem the rise if, indeed, it does anything at all.

Meanwhile, Britain's economy is robust, its interest rates high, and the Bank of England appears to have abandoned intervention to hold sterling down. But last week also was marked by what appears to be a public conflict between Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her most senior Treasury official over exchange rate policy. In late New York trading Friday, the pound advanced to $1.8565 from $1.8460 late Thursday.

The U.S. dollar was narrowly mixed and the British pound stronger as both currencies seesawed in foreign exchange trading yesterday. Dealers attributed the wide swings to short term speculative moves generated by interbank trading that didn't represent any change in the long term outlook for either currency. It's basically the exchange market trading with itself, said James M. Pugh, vice president of corporate foreign exchange at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York.

The British pound's surge halted yesterday as the Bank of England was widely rumored to have intervened in currency markets to cool speculative interest in the currency. Although the central bank's rumored selling of pounds for West German marks appeared to be effective, sending sterling lower, dealers said that the British currency still holds considerable investor interest and could rebound. Meanwhile, against a backdrop of bad economic news, the U.S. dollar fell against most other major currencies as it continued its lethargic trading in a narrow band.

The bank said in its quarterly report, issued late Thursday, that it would prefer a different monetary policy mix from its current one, saying: a combination of a stronger currency and lower interest rates doesn't represent an ideal response to current (inflationary) concerns and a different balance would be desirable.

Unable to profit from the dollar's volatility, traders have bought sterling to earn its higher yields. Yesterday, three month Eurosterling deposits yielded 8 5/16%, in contrast to 7 3/8 for similar dollar investments, and 3 9/16% for three month Euromark deposits.

High yielding currencies continued surging yesterday, prompting the British and Australian central banks to intervene in foreign exchange markets to restrain the rise of their currencies, dealers said. The dollar was slightly weaker against most other major currencies. However, according to some dealers, the dollar is benefiting indirectly from so called cross trading between non dollar currencies.

Profit taking and rumored central bank intervention reversed a brief but sharp rally in sterling yesterday immediately after the British government released its budget proposal. The pound began soaring around midday New York time as British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson presented the U.K. government's proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning in April. As Mr. Lawson concluded his remarks, the pound was already under selling pressure from traders taking profits on the currency's quick runup.

The dollar was mixed against most major currencies in light trading yesterday as dealers awaited the latest word on the U.S. economy and monetary policy, scheduled for tomorrow. Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker are scheduled to testify before separate Senate panels tomorrow, and comments by either official could move currency rates, traders said. People want to see whether Volcker and Baker are dancing to the same tune, said Peter Rogers, vice president and chief foreign exchange dealer at Banca Nazionale Dell'Agricoltura, New York.

The British pound continued its surge in foreign exchange trading yesterday but ran into resistance from the U.S. Federal Reserve. The dollar, meanwhile, fell in moderately active New York trading despite the Fed's attempts to prop it up and limit the pound's gains. According to dealers at several New York banks, the Fed sold #70 million ($131.8 million) of the British currency in afternoon trading after sterling climbed to its intraday highs of $1.8825 and 3.1250 West German marks.

The British pound surged more than 1% against major currencies in response to the British government's new budget. Sterling's advance was especially significant, traders said, because it coincided with a drop in British interest rates following yesterday's formal proposal of the fiscal 1988 budget. Lower interest rates tend to reduce demand for the currency.

Major British banks raised their base rates one half percentage point to 8.5%, the second boost in four days, as U.K. authorities scrambled to stanch the pound's recent decline. Separately, West Germany's central bank reportedly exchanged at least $2 billion for marks through covert channels in the foreign exchange market in the last week of May. A further increase in U.K. base rates had been expected since Friday's boost to 8% from 7.5%, their lowest level in a decade.

That prompted National Westminster Bank PLC, Britain's biggest bank, to announce a half point base rate cut.

The British pound's rally paused, and the U.S. dollar also eased in quiet foreign exchange trading yesterday. Trading was subdued by concern about possible central bank intervention to prevent exchange rates for both the pound and dollar from venturing beyond the levels of recent dealings. Anxiety about central bank intrusion into currency markets is caused by last month's exchange rate stabilization agreement among the U.S. and its top five economic allies, traders said.

The dollar firmed in thin trading as dealers generally sat out the session or squared positions ahead of today's report on the U.S. merchandise trade balance for August. The trade report, widely considered the most influential piece of economic data for exchange rates, isn't expected to contain good news for the dollar, many market participants say. Estimates of the U.S. deficit for the month range from about $13 billion to $15.5 billion.

The dollar was mixed yesterday after rebounding from a sell off in Europe that sent it to a five month low against the West German mark. Meanwhile, West German monetary officials said they wouldn't intervene to block a further slight decline in the dollar's value. The remarks by the officials, who didn't want to be identified, tend to support the belief of many currency traders that officials of major industrial nations have lowered the range of dollar exchange rates that they would find acceptable.

As the dollar remained confined in a narrow trading range, Japan's finance ministry proposed a sharp buildup of funds available for intervention in the foreign exchange markets. Traders have attributed the dollar's timid movements in recent days to fears of a reappearance of heavy, coordinated central bank support of the U.S. currency.

Traders believed that British interest rates are still much more attractive than those in the U.S., West Germany or Japan and that the rate cut ultimately will stimulate economic growth in the United Kingdom.

Traders said the dollar probably would have had a broad decline if not for the Mideast developments, which fueled interest in the U.S. currency as a haven for international investors.

The British pound, leader of the recent rally in high yielding currencies, is beginning to look too pricey, some foreign exchange dealers say. Although sterling isn't headed for a sharp downturn soon, several factors may stymie any significant advances, the dealers maintain. We don't see a lot of upside potential for sterling from here, but we don't think sterling is about to collapse either, says Geoffrey Dennis, international economist at James Capel &amp; Co., a London broker.

The dollar strengthened on the back of yesterday's report on U.S. merchandise trade that showed a smaller deficit for January than most analysts expected. But a sustained advance by the dollar remains unlikely, traders said. Meanwhile, the Bank of England cut a key interest rate, prompting rate reductions by British commercial banks.

The British pound rose sharply against the U.S. dollar and most other major European currencies yesterday in an otherwise lackluster trading day. The dollar was higher against most major currencies besides the pound, but it failed to break out of its narrow trading range of the past two weeks. The U.S. unit's recent sluggish movements against its major counterparts, combined with higher interest rates offered for sterling denominated investments, were largely responsible for the pound's rise, dealers said.

The dollar firmed in sparse holiday trading on Friday's news that West Germany will impose a 10% withholding tax on most income from investments and bank deposits.

Unlike the European currencies, the yen didn't benefit indirectly from the pound's recent strength, and therefore, the Japanese currency wasn't pressured by yesterday's selling of sterling, traders said.

The British pound is likely to remain the focus of attention on the foreign exchange market this week as the U.S. dollar continues to play a reduced role in trading, dealers predict. The dollar rose against most other major currencies Friday, aided by U.S. emloyment statistics that were slightly better than expected. Nonetheless, the currency continued to trade within a narrow range.

Currency traders are debating whether the British pound's declines Thursday and Friday signal an end to investors' recent hearty appetite for high yielding currencies. They also wonder whether the dollar's fall against the yen and West German mark Friday indicates a new willingness to push the U.S. unit lower and test central bankers' determination to support it. It's a confused market, Anne Parker Mills, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said.

It's a confused market, Anne Parker Mills, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said. She and other analysts this week will be trying to determine the impact of several events: the announcement of the new British government budget tomorrow, the approach of the March 31 end of Japan's fiscal year, central banks' unexpected willingness so far to intervene to keep their currencies from rising too far against the dollar and growing worries about Third World debt.

In selling dollars yesterday, the trader said, the Bundesbank could have registered a sizable foreign exchange profit. I think they'd be thrilled if the dollar went higher, he said.

In addition, he said, any Bundesbank move to sell dollars and buy marks would help West Germany's efforts to control its rapidly expanding money supply.

A remark by Japan's central bank chief that the U.S. Federal Reserve has acted to avert a further drop in the dollar pushed the currency to the top of its recent trading range against the Japanese yen. Separately, officials in London said the Bank of England's underlying reserves fell $230 million in June. The drop, which private analysts hadn't been expecting, apparently reflected intervention by the British central bank to support the pound after the Conservative Party government's election victory June 11.

Public opinion polls in Britain that showed the ruling Conservative Party widening its lead over its rivals caused the British pound to rally in otherwise dull foreign exchange trading yesterday. The dollar was narrowly mixed in thin trading, and traders said the market could be quiet for the rest of the week while finance ministers from major industrial nations meet in Washington. They cautioned that the calm could be disturbed at any time, however, by leaks or disclosures about the talks.

The dollar continued climbing in foreign exchange trading yesterday as dealers weighed the significance of the U.S. Federal Reserve's intervention to support the dollar last week. Neither the Fed nor other major central banks were seen intervening in currency markets yesterday, traders said. But last week's apparently coordinated dollar purchases by the Fed, the West German Bundesbank, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England left many dealers with the impression that the major monetary powers were embarking on another period of close cooperation to support the U.S. currency.

For the third consecutive day, some major central banks fought off a bullish charge by the dollar, substantially limiting the U.S. currency's gains. The intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the West German Bundesbank seemed to represent a stepped up effort to contain the dollar in its surge prompted by fears of a widened Persian Gulf war. Yesterday's action appeared more coordinated than the earlier efforts.

A mild rally in the dollar Friday ended two weeks of lethargic trading and stirred speculation that the U.S. currency will strengthen in the short run. The speculation is largely based on charts of recent trading activity and observations that despite widespread bearish sentiment, selling pressure hasn't been enough to push the dollar sharply lower. The momentum, or lack of it, has been a little frustrating on the downside, said Teri Reid, a corporate foreign exchange adviser at Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank, Chicago.

A rumor of central bank selling of dollars snapped the foreign exchange market out of a summer lull, stifling a modest rally in the U.S. currency and leaving the dollar a little lower for the day. The British pound also took a beating in the market, prompting the Bank of England to come to its rescue by buying sterling in the open market, traders said. Although activity was sudden and hectic, the swing in exchange rates wasn't large by current market standards.
