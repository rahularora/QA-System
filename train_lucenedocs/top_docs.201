Up to 10 spacewalks a week will be needed to maintain outside components of the proposed Space Station Freedom unless there are major design changes, a study says. The study, by astronaut Bill Fisher and Johnson Space Center engineer Charles Price and released Friday, showed that in peak maintenance years with the present space station design, two astronauts working together would have to spend up to 6,462 hours a year in space suits repairing and replacing parts. Other years, the maintenance would require fewer space walks, the study said, but over the 35 year lifetime of the station the time spent on repair space walks would average about 3,276 astronaut hours a year.

We appreciate the good words from everybody, replied Discovery Commander Loren Shriver. After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to park Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble. The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it does good work, Shriver said Wednesday.

Czechoslovakia's transition from a communist to private enterprise economy will be swift and thorough in order to avoid the halfway reforms that are causing economic chaos in the Soviet Union, the Czech finance minister said Thursday. Partial reform of a distorted economy ... is much worse than a non reform, and delays to prepare a comprehensive blueprint mean postponing it to eternity, Minister Vaclav Klaus said. Such a cautious approach leads very soon to chaotic disintegration of the economy, as we see in the Soviet economy just now, Klaus added in a speech to the World Bank's second annual conferening the problem to see what was wrong.

But, with two astronauts standing by to take a spacewalk if necessary, a second set of radio commands freed the panels, and the satellite was successfully deployed high over the Soviet Union, Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology reported in its Dec. 12 issue. The panels are needed to absorb sunlight which powers the satellite's batteries.

A new NASA report concludes that the planned $37 billion space station will require nearly 75 percent more maintenance than earlier predicted, a newspaper reported today. The conclusion prompted the space agency to set up a special team to search for ways to reduce maintenance of the 500 foot long station, The New York Times said. The newspaper quoted NASA engineers it did not identify by name as saying the station, intended as a centerpiece for study of the solar system by spacewalking astronauts, must be redesigned.

US astronauts successfully completed the first of five spacewalks planned to repair the Hubble telescope. The mission is viewed as critical both to restore public support for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and to prove astronauts can do the type of work needed to assemble a planned space station.

In hush hush surroundings, Kennedy Space Center workers are readying the shuttle Atlantis for launch on Thursday with five astronauts and a Defense Department satellite set to spy on the Soviet Union. The secrecy contrasts markedly with the Discovery flight earlier this fall, which was heavily publicized by NASA every step of the way as the nation's return to space following the Challenger disaster. Hundreds of thousands of spectators watched Discovery take off and land, but Atlantis will be off limits to the public.

Durrance said he started working on the Astro project in 1982 and was finally picked to fly on a shuttle mission to operate the observatory two years later. My feelings about the Astro are great.

The former test pilot made his first shuttle flight August 1989 on a secret Defense Department mission. Richards, 44, said before the flight that he believed a successful mission would help people forget about NASA's recent troubles, which include hydrogen leaks aboard the Atlantis and Columbia space shuttles. Right now, we don't look so good, he said.

Space shuttle Atlantis lifted off into a windy sky at the last possible minute Friday a spectacularly public act to carry into orbit a $500 million secret satellite that can pierce darkness or clouds to vastly enhance America's capacity to spy on the Soviets. Not a word was heard outside the NASA and Air Force control rooms from commander Robert Gibson or the four other military crewmen who are carrying out the highly classified mission to deploy the 18 ton satellite Lacrosse. Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldridge, who observed the liftoff from the control center, thanked the launch team, saying let me tell you that you have made a great contribution to the nation's national security.

Installing a donut shaped device on the outside of the Hubble Space Telescope is one idea that NASA scientists are discussing to partially correct the instrument's focusing flaw. Officials said Tuesday that a donut could be installed by spacewalking astronauts to partially close the eye of Hubble. This would sharpen the telescope focus slightly, but could present other problems, NASA experts said.

Officials said Tuesday that a donut could be installed by spacewalking astronauts to partially close the eye of Hubble. This would sharpen the telescope focus slightly, but could present other problems, NASA experts said. Meanwhile, James Beggs, the NASA administrator during the era that the Hubble Space Telescope was being built, testifies before Congress today for the first time since it was discovered that the $1.5 billion telescope is seriously flawed.

This causes it to see the universe as a blur instead of the sharp, crisp images of distant stars that the space agency had claimed it would see. The New York Times reported today that NASA has a backup mirror for the Hubble that could have been used to replace the telescope's mirror if testing had been performed on the ground to find the focusing flaw.

Solovyev and Balandin made a life threatening spacewalk July 17 to repair their capsule's thermal insulation, which was torn on takeoff. The repairs took seven hours, longer than anticipated, and their life support supplies nearly ran out. Having damaged the exit and entry hatch at the beginning of the spacewalk, the cosmonauts were forced to return through an emergency porthole.

Having damaged the exit and entry hatch at the beginning of the spacewalk, the cosmonauts were forced to return through an emergency porthole. In their haste, they left behind handrails attached to the exterior of the capsule. A second spacewalk was required July 26 to retrieve the handrails and fix the hatch.

Two cosmonauts left the orbiting space station Mir today to make a second attempt to repair a Dutch made telescope, Radio Moscow reported. Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov were using new tools and materials brought to the space station by the cargo ferry ship Progress recently, the broadcast said. Titov and Manarov had tried unsuccessfully in a five hour space walk June 30 to replace a detector unit on the telescope, which was mounted on an observatory attached to Mir.

Components of the unit melted because of exposure to cosmic radiation, Radio Moscow said. The problem in the June repair attempt was that the cosmonauts couldn't unfasten the clasp holding the balky detector unit to the telescope, the Tass news agency said at the time.

In today's space walk, scheduled to last several hours, Titov and Manarov were wearing new spacesuits designed to allow the cosmonauts more flexibility, Soviet television reported.

Chunks of shrapnel from unexplained explosions are hurtling through space at 22,000 mph and forcing designers to add tons of shielding to protect the proposed U.S. space station and its crew. Nearly 7,100 pieces of orbiting debris are being tracked by the U.S. Space Command and more than half came from satellites or spent rockets that have blown up or broken up for unknown reasons, a NASA expert says. More than 90 satellites to date have shattered unaccountably, but Don Kessler, project scientist for debris studies at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said he doubts the cause is collisions with meteoroids or tests of secret anti satellite weapons.

The debris gets most severe at 500 600 miles, Kessler said, but usually unmanned spacecraft are at that altitude and don't require the same level of safety as a crew.

A 3 millimeter particle has as much kinetic energy as a bowling ball going 60 miles an hour and if it hit an electrical component, it would probably cause that system to cease functioning, Kessler said.
