Rio Grande Industries Inc. received government approval Tuesday for its $1.2 billion purchase of the Southern Pacific Railroad, one of the nation's oldest rail lines with track stretching from Oregon to Louisiana. Southern Pacific, which has 15,000 miles of track, will retain its name and incorporate into its operations the smaller Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad once the purchase is completed, company officials said. By a 4 0 vote, the Interstate Commerce Commission gave approval for the railroad's sale by its parent Sante Fe Southern Pacific Corp., to Rio Grande Industries, a subsidiary of the Denver based Anschutz Corp. Philip Anschutz, owner of the privately held company, told reporters he intends to concentrate on reducing Southern Pacific's debts, partly through the sale of some of its real estate holdings, and modernize the railroad's equipment and facilities.

The Interstate Commerce Commission, ending one of the longest running sagas in modern railroad history, refused to reconsider its 1986 rejection of the proposed merger of the Southern Pacific and Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe railroads. The 4 1 vote underscored the commission's continued strong concerns about the potentially anti competitive nature of the merger, which would have produced the nation's third largest railroad, with more than 25,000 miles of track in the West and Southwest. The action will force Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., the Chicago based parent company of both railroads, to sell at least one of the railroads.

After several lean years, the Southern Pacific is showing some signs of rebirth, due in large part to a stabilized customer base and lower costs for fuel and labor. The company showed a profit in the first quarter, usually the quarter with the lowest railroad traffic of the year.

Creating a transcontinental rail system faces some problems. Some rail executives long have dismissed as minimal the potential cost savings and traffic gains from such combinations. In addition, the formation of a coast to coast railroad likely would spur competitors to make similar combinations, and those proposed combinations would face regulatory hurdles, including ICC review.

The Interstate Commerce Commission heard from two railroads Wednesday that are vying for the purchase of the Southern Pacific Railroad, which is on the auction block because of a failed merger attempt last year. The Santa Fe Pacific Corp., had agreed to sell its Southern Pacific subsidiary to Rio Grande Industries Inc., the parent company of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad for $1.02 billion. But the deal, which requires ICC approval, has run into strong opposition from Kansas City Southern Industries, operator of the Kansas City Southern Railroad, which has offered $1.25 billion for the 13,000 mile rail system that stretches from Kansas City to the West Coast.

The Interstate Commerce Commission is expected today to approve the sale of Southern Pacific Transportation Co. to Rio Grande Industries Inc., closing a five year controversy over the fate of one of the nation's oldest railroads. The commission, meeting in Washington, D.C., is expected to approve the sale despite strenuous objections from Kansas City Southern Industries Inc., which has offered $1.25 billion in cash and notes for Southern Pacific. A commission official said the ICC is concerned about how a court judgment of as much as $600 million against Kansas City Southern in the state of South Dakota will affect that company's financial outlook.

The railroad is appealing the judgment, but a federal judge last week said he would bar Kansas City Southern from completing a purchase of Southern Pacific until the case is resolved. Kansas City Southern's bid for Southern Pacific totaled $1.25 billion in cash and debentures.

The proliferation of double stack container trains is igniting a rate war between truckers and railroads, benefiting shippers with lower freight rates. More than 100 double stack trains, which carry one container loaded above another, now ply the nation's long haul east west freight routes each week, compared with a handful five years ago. Double stack rates between Chicago and Los Angeles dropped 15% in the past 12 months, as freight hauling capacity continued to grow amid a slowdown in demand.

The two railway units have operated separately since their parents, Santa Fe Industries Inc. and Southern Pacific Corp., combined in 1983 to form Santa Fe Southern Pacific.

In 1983, executives of the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway devised a plan that seemed as solid as the carrier's granite track beds: create a giant new railroad by acquiring the rival Southern Pacific. But four years later, one of the biggest mergers in rail history is falling apart. Although the parent companies have combined their assets, management errors and regulatory red tape have repeatedly delayed the blending of the two railroads, which are still held in separate units.

Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.'s three year struggle to merge the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads cleared one hurdle, but another may have surfaced. Santa Fe Southern Pacific said it and Union Pacific Corp., another railroad concern, agreed on a plan to clear up regulatory concerns that doomed the merger of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific lines last summer. But at the same time, Union Pacific voiced new objections to a similar agreement between Santa Fe Southern Pacific and another competitor.

Billionaire Philip Anschutz has completed a $1.8 billion acquisition of the Southern Pacific Railroad, one of the nation's oldest rail lines with track stretching from Oregon to Louisiana. The historic railroad, combined with his Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad, puts Anschutz at the head of the nation's fifth largest rail company in terms of track mileage. The purchase ends years of uncertainty and opens the door to robust competition in the western rail corridors, said Rio Grande Chariman W. J. Holtman at the deal's closing in New York on Thursday.

The application was based on the belief that it would be in the best public interest for KCSI to own Southern Pacific, said Landon Rowland, president and chief executive officer of KCSI, on Monday. Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corporation has been required by the ICC to divest the Southern Pacific because a merger between it and the Santa Fe Railway would have essentially ended railroad competition in the Southwest and other markets served by the two railroads, Rowland said. Santa Fe Southern Pacific chose to sell the Southern Pacific to Denver Rio Grande, rather than to Kansas City Southern, for what we believe to be purely anti competitive reasons, he said.

Under agency rules, commissioners must distribute any amendments the day before a planned vote.

Although the commission has agreed to rethink its position and a decision is expected during the next four months, some industry observers have begun to question whether Mr. Schmidt's dogged persistence makes sense especially given the ICC's historic reluctance to reverse itself. There are two schools of thought about what he's doing, says Jeffrey Stone, a railroad analyst with Wertheim &amp; Co. in New York. There are those who think he's being very pragmatic and practical and doing something right for the company, but very difficult.

A federal court has canceled a scheduled Friday hearing on Kansas City Southern Industries' application for a stay of a recent court order barring its efforts to purchase the Southern Pacific Railroad. KCSI president and chief executive Landon Rowland said he asked the court to cancel the hearing on the advice of company attorneys, who said it was procedurally not ripe to have the hearing now. He said the cancellation had nothing to do with Tuesday's Interstate Commerce Commission approval of Rio Grande Industries Inc.'s proposal to buy Southern Pacific.

One new service in particular the Asia East Coast Express, operated by Singapore based Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. (NOL) in partnership with Japan's Nippon Yusen Kaisha is being watched by both the shipping industry, which has been hurt by recession and overcapacity in recent years, and by East Coast ports, which are eager to grab more of the lucrative Asian market dominated by West Coast rivals. The Suez route doesn't pose any near term threat to the Pacific Rim shipping business, according to businessmen and analysts. But it gives some East Coast ports a needed boost and points to the increasing importance of Southeast Asia as a manufacturing center.

What's going out from the U.S., Mr. Mongno says, is basically one step above junk scrap paper and plastics, chemical residues and logs that the Asians recycle or hone into new products. Southeast Asia appears well positioned for more growth, and the shipping companies are trying to prepare for that, analysts say. NOL, for instance, has expanded its network of relay services within Asia, starting a feeder route between Vietnam and Singapore, and is making more feeder trips to and from Bangkok, Thailand, as well as India and Pakistan.

Athough once the largest private landowner in California, Southern Pacific has sold $1.2 billion worth of property and track rights since Philip F. Anschutz bought the company for $1.02 billion in 1988, raising operating cash and reducing the $1.7 billion debt that faced the Denver billionaire. ; Despite recent losses, Southern Pacific officials remain optimistic about the future because their real estate sales have offset operating losses of the last two years and because the loss was less last year than in 1989.; What we're convinced of is, if there hadn't been a recession and Persian Gulf war and a spike in fuel costs, '91 would have been a profitable year, said Southern Pacific spokesman Michael Brown. Because of those reasons, though, the company suffered a significant operating loss in the first quarter.

Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., which last week said it wouldn't bid for Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., has increased its stake in the giant railroad, energy and real estate concern. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Olympia &amp; York, a Toronto based real estate developer controlled by the Reichmann family, said it increased its holding to 8.2% from 6.9%. The move ensures that Olympia &amp; York is still a force to contend with as Santa Fe tries to steel itself against potential hostile bidders.

In The Santa Fe Fears a Rail Regulatory Relapse (Business World, April 7), George Melloan argues that a second rejection by the ICC of a merger between the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads would be a disturbing reversal of deregulation. Mr. Melloan mischaracterizes both the reduction in rail regulation that has occurred since the passage of the Staggers Act of 1980 and the ICC's competitive analysis of the proposed merger. The Staggers Act did not deregulate the railroads.

The ICC rejected the SF SP merger because it would have significantly reduced transportation competition and, as a result, would have increased the need to regulate rail rates. Mr. Melloan argues that few if any shippers are truly captive to railroads because many shippers can choose between rail and highway. There are, however, a significant number of shippers that cannot economically use trucks.

Mr. Melloan argues that few if any shippers are truly captive to railroads because many shippers can choose between rail and highway. There are, however, a significant number of shippers that cannot economically use trucks. Mr. Melloan incorrectly characterizes as esoteric the debate before the ICC over whether trucks are competitive on hauls of more than 1,000 miles.

There are, however, a significant number of shippers that cannot economically use trucks. Mr. Melloan incorrectly characterizes as esoteric the debate before the ICC over whether trucks are competitive on hauls of more than 1,000 miles. Generally, a lessening of railroad competition on these longer hauls cannot be attenuated by competition from trucks.

Generally, a lessening of railroad competition on these longer hauls cannot be attenuated by competition from trucks. The ICC's decision to reject the merger was based on a determination, in which the Justice Department concurred, that the merger would reduce overall transportation competition, not just rail competition, for a significant amount of traffic.

Mr. Melloan also mischaracterizes the role of mergers in reviving the badly rundown rail system that existed at the time the Staggers Act was passed. The reductions in costs that have been achieved in the past six years have principally resulted from non merger provisions in the Staggers Act that allow the abandonment of unprofitable lines, the formation of nonunion short line railroads, the tailoring of rates and service through contracts, and the rationalization of the rate structure.

Whether these cost savings can best be realized through mergers is problematic since there has been no railroad merger between close horizontal competitors since well before the passage of the act.

In general, a large percentage of predicted efficiencies from railroad mergers have failed to materialize. More specifically, the efficiency estimates by the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific are riddled with errors and misconceptions. When a merger reduces competition, its approval requires a careful and accurate showing of efficiencies that could not be achieved without the merger.
