The volcanic fallout also shredded 37,000 acres of triple canopy jungle, the last large stand of virgin forest in Luzon. Protected from the illegal logging that has deforested most of the rest of the island, the Subic jungle provided the base with a vital watershed and a unique venue for jungle survival courses taught by aboriginal Aetas, a Negrito people descended from some of the earliest inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago. The jungle is now a wasteland of smashed trees and broken ash coated limbs, its once teeming wildlife population either scattered or destroyed.

It's a real mess up there. ; U.S. officials in Washington and Manila have suggested that Clark may be abandoned because of unacceptably high reconstruction costs.

There have been suspicions that the U.S. might abandon the bases in the wake of the volcano's eruption, especially given the Pentagon's budget strains and the diminished Soviet military threat. Richard Armitage, the U.S. special negotiator, was expected to get a damage assessment from Adm. Charles Larsen, commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, before sitting down with his Philippine counterparts. Before the talks were suspended, the U.S. had offered the Philippines $360 million in annual compensation for 10 years.

The question of whether we will remain in the Philippines is something we have to look at in light of this disaster, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said. Mass evacuations from the slopes of Mount Pinatubo and nearby cities and towns and the closure of Clark have created a sense that the Philippines faces a disaster similar in severity to the July 1990 earthquake that killed more than 2,000 people and damaged roads, bridges and buildings throughout the main island of Luzon. But estimates by Philippine officials, foreign economists and international aid experts suggest that the eruption, which has killed about 170 people, will have little impact on the country's economy.
