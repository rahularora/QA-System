Secretary of State James A. Baker III prepares to call for a decisive hemispheric stand against Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as foreign ministers from the Organization of American States gather here today. A highlight of the meeting is expected to be the admission of Canada as the 32nd OAS member, effective Jan. 1. There also is some sentiment in support of readmitting Cuba.

In a diplomatic compromise accepted by both the United States and Panama, the Organization of American States called for a transfer of power through democratic means in Panama while leaving the details to a team of mediators. The plan was unanimously authorized late Wednesday by OAS foreign ministers in a resolution that condemns the grave events and abuses by Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega but which also stops short of criticizing his government. The resolution, approved in an unusually efficient manner by the 29 delegates present, was sufficiently ambiguous to win the approval of the two biggest antagonists at the session: Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter.

The resolution, approved in an unusually efficient manner by the 29 delegates present, was sufficiently ambiguous to win the approval of the two biggest antagonists at the session: Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter. Baker pronounced himself very pleased with the outcome.

U.S. officials have virtually given up hope that Organization of American States mediators will be able to succeed in arranging a democratic transfer of power in Panama, but Secretary of State James A. Baker III remained publicly optimistic today. One official dismissed the mediation as a corpse and said alternative ideas must be pursued for pressuring Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to step down. Three OAS mediators, aided by Secretary General Joao Baena Soares, have made two visits to Panama over the past month to attempt to seek a solution to the country's political crisis.

BFN [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 7 Jun (PL) The 24th OAS General Assembly continued today receiving new requests urging the readmittance of Cuba into the OAS, from which it was removed in 1962 due to its political disagreement with the United States. During the second day of talks in Belem, Para State, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim reintroduced the topic of Cuba's readmittance before the OAS meeting and reiterated the need for reviewing the Cuban situation within the hemispheric community. During the inauguration of the 24th OAS Assembly on Monday, outgoing OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares as well as Brazilian President Itamar Franco recommended that Cuba's readmittance be considered, although this topic is not part of the agenda to be discussed at the meeting which will conclude Friday.

The United States has lobbied hard against Cuba's readmission, citing alleged Cuban support for subversion in Central America and reported human rights abuses.

Organization of American States foreign ministers are asking Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to arrange a transfer of power over the next six weeks as part of a plan to restore democratic rule in Panama. A declaration approved by the ministers Thursday was a masterpiece of diplomatic evenhandedness, earning the support of both the U.S. delegate and Noriega's representative. Specifically, the declaration said the proposed transfer of power on Sept. 1 and subsequent free elections are to be carried out through democratic means and in conformity with existing internal Panamanian procedures.

The government controlled by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, head of the Defense Forces and Panama's de facto ruler, annulled the election on May 10. In addition to having its victory recognized, the opposition wants Noriega to resign, something the United States has sought since last year. We feel that our proposal for a three way negotiation involving the government, the opposition and the military has been accepted, another member of the OAS mission, Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez, said.

The Bush administration is preparing to lobby hard for a tough resolution denouncing Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega when Organization of American States foreign ministers meet next week to discuss the Panama crisis. But Panamanian authorities are expected to blame the upheaval in their country on what they regard as systematic U.S. intervention in Panama's internal affairs. The OAS permanent council on Friday approved a Venezuelan proposal for the OAS foreign ministers to meet next Wednesday to discuss the serious crisis in Panama.

A mission from the Organization of American States arrived Sunday for its second try at mediating the month old election crisis, and the legislature's speaker urged the group to focus on what he called U.S. meddling. The four man delegation includes OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares and the foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago. The OAS mission failed on its trip in May to negotiate an end to the crisis, touched off when the government led by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega annulled results of the May 7 presidential election.

The Organization of American States gave a team of mediators an additional six weeks to work out a democratic transition in Panama but a top Panamanian official said no solution is possible so long as his country is permanently threatened by the United States. OAS foreign ministers met Tuesday night to review the situation in Panama three weeks after they authorized envoys from Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad to try to work out a democratic transfer of power in Panama. During almost four hours of debate Tuesday night, there was little sign that the mediators had come close to fulfilling that goal.

The ban lasts until June 5, when the OAS delegation is due to report back to the organization's headquarters in Washington.

Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger was preparing to present new drug charges against Panama at a special meeting Thursday of the Organization of American States, U.S. officials said.

The 18 month unsuccessful U.S. campaign to oust Noriega as the behind the scenes ruler in Panama is getting only lukewarm support from the hemisphere group.

The 34 delegates to the 24th OAS General Assembly the main forum of dialogue and agreement within the Americas and which will close on 10 June have addressed the possibility of readmitting Cuba into the OAS with a businesslike approach, although without much enthusiasm.

[Baena Soares] I am very pleased with the fact that I was able to be present at the OAS during a period of reaffirmation and modernization of our organization. I am leaving an organization that is prominent; able to meet new challenges; has been strengthened by member countries' political will; is able to react to attacks on democratic processes; and is prepared to cope with serious problems involving trade, environment, illegal drug abuse, and all those issues currently worrying the modern world.

And this may be the date when the OAS was formally established. It is not possible to say that an organization established more than 100 years ago is not mature.

[Banales Marino] At this moment and with the current OAS structure, do you believe the OAS has more mechanisms available to improve Latin America's political and social perspectives?

[Banales Marino] During your tenure as OAS secretary general there were a number of crises in Latin America in which the OAS became strongly involved.

[Baena Soares] I believe the entire peace process in Central America represented a very significant participation effort by our organization.
