After decades of studying wildlife in an unspoiled area of Antarctica, scientists have begun a new, unwelcome line of research: the effects of an oil spill. This disaster is the experiment nobody wanted, said National Science Foundation spokesman Jack Talmadge. By Tuesday, American cleanup crews are expected to reach the area affected by the sinking of an oil laden supply ship, which ran aground Jan. 28 off the Antarctic Peninsula.

By Tuesday, American cleanup crews are expected to reach the area affected by the sinking of an oil laden supply ship, which ran aground Jan. 28 off the Antarctic Peninsula. Scientists have already seen oil covered and apparently lethargic seals, three dead penguins and disappearances of young nesting birds, said Ted DeLaca, chief scientist of the foundation's division of polar programs.

Thirty eight of 40 penguins checked Friday bore traces of oil. Thousands of dead and dying krill, shrimplike crustaceans that are a key food for bigger animals, have shown up on beaches, DeLaca told reporters by telephone from Palmer Station, a research outpost near the spill.

Adelie penguin chicks are expected to leave their nests for the first time in a few days, swimming into contaminated waters. Other birds are being exposed to the oil as they land on water or dive into it to feed. Scientists are concerned that birds may freeze to death if the oil disrupts their natural insulation, or be poisoned if they swallow oil while preening themselves or eating oil covered prey.

Scientists are concerned that birds may freeze to death if the oil disrupts their natural insulation, or be poisoned if they swallow oil while preening themselves or eating oil covered prey. The spill struck an area that has the largest and most diverse plant and animal populations of the continent, said Polly Penhale, manager of the science foundation's polar biology and medicine program.

Neushul said one factor boding poorly for the area's wildlife is that the spill involved fuel oil, which is much more toxic than crude oil because it can damage biological tissue.

A ship laden with more than 50 tons of equipment headed toward the Antarctic today to try and contain an oil spill that experts say is killing wildlife and threatening to wipe out a colony of baby penguins. The spill, from a sunken Argentine supply ship, has fouled the once pure waters of a pristine bay and was endangering more than 24,000 penguins and other nesting birds, said biologist Ted De Laca. It's very disturbing.

Chilean frogmen worked to stop oil from leaking from a partially submerged ship off Antarctica, authorities said, and a report today said thousands of polar seabirds have already died near the spreading slick. Crewmen from the Chilean cutter Yelcho on Tuesday encircled the nearly sunken Argentina vessel Bahia Paraiso with floating booms designed to contain any further leakage, said a navy communique released in Santiago. New Zealand Press Association today reported that thousands of baby Polar Skua gulls had died because their parents were unable to find food.

Deteriorating weather has forced the Argentine navy to halt efforts to clean up a fuel oil spill from a ship that went aground Jan. 28 near an American Antarctic research station. A statement released Thursday by the Argentine Embassy said that five Argentine naval ships that had been participating in contamination control work were being withdrawn due to glacier and meteorological conditions. The statement said that oil spilled from the Argentine supply ship Bahia Paraiso has been removed from the sea surface and that all potential pollutants have been removed from the wrecked ship.

There were conflicting reports of the extent of the spill, which occurred when an Argentine research and supply boat hit a rock Saturday and listed before sinking Tuesday. The 9,300 ton vessel, the Paradise Bay, was carrying 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel, according to the Science Foundation.

An Argentine supply ship that ran aground off Antarctica sank Tuesday in heavy seas and high winds, the government said, and there was concern oil in its hold could leak and damage the environment. The sinking of the 400 foot Bahia Paraiso followed warnings from the U.S. National Science Foundation that the unspoiled Antarctic could face ecological disaster if the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel aboard the ship were to spill. No injuries were reported in the sinking.

A U.S. Air Force plane carrying tons of equipment and a team of clean up experts headed to Antarctica today to fight an oil spill that some scientists say could pose a major environmental threat. The huge C 5 plane was bound for the southern city of Punta Arenas, where its cargo and the 15 member team will be transferred to a U.S. research vessel, the Polar Duke, the U.S. Embassy in Santiago said. In the Antarctic, U.S. scientists were trying to catch floating oil barrels and propane containers near the spill, which was four miles in diameter and moving to the southwest, the National Science Foundation said.

A veteran Antarctic researcher announced findings Tuesday indicating that the depletion of the Earth's ozone layer could threaten the world's food supply. Professor Sayed El Sayed of Texas A&amp;M University said increased amounts of ultraviolet light, which a thinner ozone shield permits through to the Earth's surface, supresses biological activity in microscopic marine plants in the Antarctic. El Sayed said his findings, the first of their kind, confirm strong suspicions of biologists that ultraviolet light might mean trouble for fish, animal and other life in the southernmost part of the world.

But it is only beginning to grapple with such issues as the proliferation of bases, marine and air safety, indemnification, and medical and rescue facilities. The wreck of the Bahia Paraiso exemplifies the region's predicament. The 435 foot supply and research vessel, operated by the Argentine navy, called on Palmer Station in glacier rimmed Arthur Bay on Jan. 28 so the 81 tourists on board could take a look around.

A vast and previously undiscovered population of tiny plants and animals lives in hollowed pores carved through the sea ice that forms annually around Antarctica, researchers said in studies released Sunday. Cornelius Sullivan, co leader of a National Science Foundation polar study expedition, said scientists studying the sea ice found large and thriving populations of krill, a small shrimp like animal, grazing on one celled plants and animals that live in the ice pores. The sea ice is a place where for a small expenditure of energy the krill can avoid predators and live in a rich pastureland, said Sullivan, the director of marine biological research at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

Volunteers today began rescuing penguins from an oil slick along the southeastern coast of Australia that has already killed more than 100 of the birds. Schoolchildren joined in the effort to find dead or injured birds along a 150 mile stretch of coastline of Victoria state. Fifty six of the oil covered penguins, close to death, were being cared for at a special rescue center, said Kris Reinertson, head ranger of the Otway Range National Park.

More ultraviolet light suppresses marine productivity in the Antarctic, according to findings of new research on the Antarctic ozone hole. Sayed El Sayed of Texas A&amp;M University said Tuesday his findings could mean the existence of a threat to the krill, a tiny shrimp like creature on which all Antarctic life depends directly or indirectly. If the krill goes, the whole ecosystem probably would collapse, and the whales, seals, penguins, birds and fish would disappear, he told reporters at a briefing arranged by the World Resources Institute, a Washington environmental policy research institute that has called attention to ozone problems.

Workers have cleaned up most of the oil spilled into Antarctic waters from a sunken Argentine ship, but the accident wiped out a colony of baby birds that scientists were studying, officials said Friday. Lt. Jose Araya of the Chilean navy said the oil leak from the ship was stopped after divers patched the damaged hull of the vessel, the Bahia Paraiso. But a National Science Foundation official at the Palmer Station, a U.S. Antarctic research facility near where the ship ran aground on Jan. 28, said the oil that spill from the vessel has wiped out a colony of skua chicks.

I happened to be on World Discoverer when it was undergoing its biennial check by an observer from the National Science Foundation who had come along to ensure that the cruise was being run in a safe way; that passengers were receiving both education and supervision with regard to the wildlife they were seeing; and that the operation was observing the guidelines set down by its own controlling body, the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (Iaato). This may sound dreadfully regimented and restrictive, but some constraints are clearly necessary as the numbers of visitors, to what amounts to only a tiny proportion of the continent, grows. Such controls are at their most extreme only when large numbers of passengers are ashore.
