De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the huge South African diamond mining concern, said today it would split itself in two and base one of the newly formed companies in Switzerland. The move appeared to be an attempt by the company to minimize its exposure to potential political turbulence in South Africa, where a newly energized black majority has vowed to nationalize major industries if it wins power from the white minority. But De Beers Chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson denied that there were political reasons for the company's split, saying it reflected the international nature of De Beers and the diamond business and that it was in the interests of shareholders and the industry.

Minorco is 60.1 percent owned by Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold and diamond mining interests controlled by the Oppenheimer family of South Africa.

Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of De Beers, the South African company that controls the world diamond market, spent yesterday in the Northern Transvaal. It should have been a happy outing, attending the opening of De Beers' new R1.1bn (Pounds 200m) Venetia mine, a project which should produce 5.9m carats of diamonds a year. He could have been forgiven, however, if the prospect of more diamonds had left him feeling slightly queasy.

But De Beers not only halted a fall in rough diamond prices, it raised them an average 14.5% last year.

In the deal, described at the time as the first of its kind by a Western company, the loan was to be repaid over five years beginning in November 1990 to help meet the Soviet Union's import arrears. The Soviet Union reached the deal with De Beers because it wanted to sell a huge stockpile of diamonds without disrupting the stable diamond market, De Beers said. De Beers established De Beers Centenery in May 1990 to head its non South African business.

A miraculous survivor among luxury products, this king of gems and teardrop of the gods is still in insolently good health; and de Beers, a fairly accurate gauge of the industry's condition since it holds the monopoly on diamonds, is in equally excellent shape: The group's turnover for 1993 was $4.444 billion, compared to $3.640 the preceding year.

De Beers also will provide Endiama with a $50 million loan to increase production in the Cuango area, and an additional $50 million over the next five years to develop other diamond sources in Angola.

Excluding the share of retained profits of associates, net attributable profits were Dollars 763m or 201 cents per linked unit against Dollars 950m or 250 cents.

IT IS ironic that there is an unprecedented, greedy rush for diamonds by miners in Angola and Canada precisely at a time when the diamond business is in turmoil and questions are inevitably being asked about the ability of the world's most successful cartel to keep its tight grip on the market. In Canada's Northwest Territories, the discovery of 81 small diamonds, some of gem quality, has sparked the biggest rush to stake mining claims in the history of the North American industry. Stakers are using helicopters because each claim area is so large and prospectors have claimed every piece of land within 300 km (185 miles) of the discovery.

In July 1990, De Beers announced a $5 billion agreement to sell Soviet diamonds during a five year period. It also lent the Soviet Union $1 billion against collateral of diamonds held in London. Rossalmazzoloto, a former Soviet diamond industry organization now under the authority of the Russian republic, is honoring the sales contract, according to Gary Ralfe, the De Beers director in charge of trade with the former Soviet Union.

The De Beer diamond cartel said it will raise prices for rough gemstones an average of 13.5 percent because a weak dollar has increased demand for their products in Asia and Europe. De Beers, based in Johannesburg, South Africa, controls 80 percent of the world's rough diamond market through its London based marketing arm, Central Selling Organization. Sales of diamonds are priced in dollars and have been boosted by the drop in the U.S. currency, which makes them cheaper to holders of Japanese yen and European currencies.

The De Beers board has a quaint habit of meeting in Kimberley, the northern Cape mining town where the South African diamond producer began. Yesterday it seemed very far removed from the country's financial centre in more than just a geographic sense as the prediction of a 'significant reduction' in the final dividend sent shock waves through the Johannesburg investment community. Although the 26 per cent fall in attributable earnings was in line with predictions, most analysts were aghast at the announcement that the final dividend would be cut.

Turbulence in the global diamond markets is being felt even here at Venetia, De Beers' newest diamond mine, 30km from South Africa's borders with Botswana and Zimbabwe. Only weeks before the mine came into production in July 1992 at a cost of USDollars 400m, De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which controls 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, imposed quotas on its producer suppliers because of a flood of gem stones from Angola. For a time Venetia, the first mine of any sort in South Africa to gain permission for seven day working, moved to a five day week.

Mr Gastrow is giving no forecasts but all this implies that output will be well below the 5.6m carats a year De Beers predicted Venetia would yield at full production. Last year the mine, building up rapidly, more than doubled output and processed 3.6m tonnes of ore to recover 4.96m carats. About 70 per cent of Venetia's diamonds are of gem quality and analysts suggest that at Dollars 100 a carat on average the mine is generating annual sales of about Dollars 500m.

Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of Anglo American Corporation, the world's largest natural resources group, had two reasons for celebration at the weekend. There was the successful outcome of the first all race elections in South Africa, where Anglo dominates the economy. There was also a 60th anniversary party in London for the Central Selling Organisation, the most successful cartel in history, accounting as it does for 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds.

DE BEERS, the South African group which controls about 80 per cent of the world's rough (uncut) diamond trade, yesterday admitted it had no clear idea of how many gem stones were being smuggled out of Russia. It also became clear yesterday that De Beers faces competition from Japan in Yakutia, where 99 per cent of Russian diamonds are mined and where it hopes to help set up a cutting centre. In any case, the South African group is not confident of its grip on the Russian diamonds business and therefore wants to reconfirm its existing five year contract which gives it a virtual monopoly of Russia's rough diamond exports.

Some Botswana politicians want to change De Beers' exclusive sales contract so that part of their country's output can be sold independently of the South African group's international cartel.

But now De Beers is steering the world's most successful cartel through depressed market conditions caused by the recession in the US (the biggest single market for diamonds), sogginess in Japan (the second largest), and the Gulf war. To maintain price stability, the CSO is stockpiling diamonds at great expense, rather than releasing unwanted stones to the market. Its promotional budget has been lifted by 20 per cent to more than Dollars 1m a week Dollars 53m for the year.

This view is reflected in the performance of the Belgian diamond market which saw a strong expansion in the 1980s, followed by a period of stabilisation between 1991 2. In the past six months, the market showed signs of a revival.

In the past six months, the market showed signs of a revival. The chief reasons for the improvement were a recovery in the US; a decline in the supply of illegally mined diamonds from Angola (which continues to be disrupted by the civil war); and preventive action by the CSO to deal with dumping by Russian producers on key world markets.

Mr Ogilvy Thompson is cautiously optimistic about the future. But he warns: 'There will be no dramatic increase in business, until there is a resurgence of world economic activity, and that, unfortunately, may still be up to a year away.
