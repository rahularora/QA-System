In an age which has seen blockbuster exhibitions swell to ever more monstrous proportions, the National Gallery in London has pioneered series of modest shows which recognise how rewarding it can be to look hard and think about a single work. For the first in a new series, Making and Meaning, which again focuses on major works in its own collection, the spotlight is directed towards the Wilton Diptych in the aftermath of its recent cleaning and technical examination. This small, portable altarpiece is one of the most refined and sumptuous products of the late medieval world.
