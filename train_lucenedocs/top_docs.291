The heirs of an American soldier accused of pilfering medieval art treasures from a German church during World War II have given the trove to a Dallas museum for safekeeping while their ownership is settled. The Quedlinburg treasures will not be displayed publicly at the Dallas Museum of Art until the ownership is decided by a U.S. District Court judge, museum director Richard R. Brettell said Thursday. Brettell said professionals and scholars might be allowed to see the treasures if the court and both sides in the lawsuit agree.

When he looked at it he'd get a dreary, transported look on his face because he knew what he had he loved it and he couldn't part with it, Hunsaker was quoted as saying. He struggled with that a lot, said Hunsaker, a 71 year old retired airline executive who lives in New York.

People who knew Joe T. Meador say they can't believe the quiet hardware store owner stole millions in medieval art from a German church while he was a soldier during World War II. The possibility that Meador stashed the precious cache in a Whitewright bank vault was the talk of this farm town Thursday, when The New York Times quoted unidentified sources as saying he was responsible for one of the century's biggest art thefts. I just don't believe he was that kind of a man, said 73 year old Mary Bryant, who said she had visited Meador's home but could not remember seeing any sumptuous works of art.

I do not often sit down to a candlelit dinner in a French cathedral but last week I had the opportunity, between mouthfuls of lamb and couscous, to study the Romanesque sculptures of the cathedral of St Lazare at Autun. At the same time I was able to contemplate the outstanding 12th century carvings of the tympanum of the Vision of the Apocalypse at the abbey church of Moissac; and I scarcely had to turn my head to see the remarkable relationship between architecture and sculpture at the basilica of St Madeleine at Vezelay. Within reach of my table were the slender sculptures from Chartres as well as columns, capitals, chancels and Carolingian conceits from all over France.

I was, of course, in a cathedral of culture, at an elegant Parisian event to mark the re opening of the Musee National des Monuments Francais at the Palais de Chaillot.

His unit was in charge of guarding a mine shaft that contained some of the world's most valuable art objects, hidden there at the time for safekeeping.

A federal judge has ordered an inventory of medieval artwork believed stolen by a U.S. soldier from a German mineshaft during World War II and stashed in a small town bank vault in Texas. U.S. District Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater ordered Tuesday that the time and place of the inspection be kept secret to protect the inspectors and the objects, which have been valued in the millions by German art experts. The Lutheran cathedral in Quedlinburg, East Germany, is suing to recover the artwork from the First National Bank in Whitewright and the family of Joe T. Meador.

The Germanys, racing to reunite their politics and peoples, are also trying to restore their cultural heritage, devastated by war and its plunders. But the task is as monumental as some of the missing treasures. During World War II, German museums, libraries and churches packed up their most valuable works and shipped them off for safekeeping from Allied bombing raids.

The destruction of war, the multiple moves, incomplete or missing inventories, and plundering occupation troops all conspired to conceal the fate of some of the treasures.

Quietly, unobtrusively and with limited funds, West Germany has been buying back important artworks that left the country during the Nazi era. Officials involved in the slow recovery of what Germans call their wandered culture decline to say how much they've spent to bring home some historically important works. But at least $29 million is known to have been spent over the past five years in the effort the government has deliberately kept on a low key.

We only hope, says a weary archivist from the eastern town of Osijek, heavily battered by the Serb forces that surround it on three sides, that the Serbs appreciate the value of all the loot they have carted off. It appears, to Croatians at least, as if the rest of the world has been standing by while Croatia slowly drowns in its own rubble. As is often the case, it has been left to a small group of art historians, patrons and restorers under the aegis of the Croatian Ministry of Culture, the Kunsthistorisches museum in Vienna and Francesca Thyssen Bornemisza's ARCH foundation, an organization set up to protect the cultural patrimony in Eastern Europe, to do something.

Since countries with tested national sovereignty are involved in the further decisions, the form of a federation of states, of cooperation of national states and their parliaments, is beginning to dominate. The old established members of the EC scene in Brussels have long predicted this development with regret, and they are not wrong: With the geographic and mental expansion, the political deepening of the Union becomes a rhetorical postulate without any prospect for realization.

Italy, France and Great Britain all have laws to screen major works of art before export, and American buyers have often chafed at restrictions that delayed or undid their purchases. However, in anticipation of the May 31 sale of the Stillman Pontormo at Christie's, many Americans began to think for the first time that such restrictions might be a good idea here.

Special Agent James D. Keith of the Miami FBI called IFAR to confirm that this picture and others that Mr. Longo said were available were in fact stolen. After the sting and the arrests, the couple was extradited to Argentina, where Interpol continued the investigation and, in short order, arrested six other individuals and recovered a second work, Portrait of Philip II, by Alonso Sanchez Coello, a Spanish 16th century court painter.

<P> Titian, Rubens, Rembrandt, Hogarth, Delacroix, Degas given the list of stellar names from the pantheon in Western art history, it might seem odd to choose Francois Xavier Fabre as the artist to represent the highly engaging exhibition, Treasures From the Fitzwilliam Museum: The Increase of Learning and other great Objects of that Noble Foundation. </P> <P> But that's just what its organizers did. Through the reproduction of a Fabre portrait on the covers of both the catalogue and the press kit, and with pride of place for the painting in the gallery installation, the show which opened Thursday at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (to Sept. 9) surprisingly features a relatively obscure artist as its metaphoric poster boy.

The museum that Ms. Atil remembers a cultural storehouse of some 7,000 objects from countries as far flung as Spain and India, dating from the eighth century no longer exists except as a shell.

Other treasures from the Kuwaiti museum owe their survival to Romance of the Taj Mahal, an exhibition at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond through Nov. 25 (the show then moves to New York's Asia Society). Although the exhibition features just six objects from the Kuwait National Museum, they include some of its finer examples of 17th century Indian jewelry: a 530 carat emerald necklace, a gold inlaid dagger with a jewel encrusted scabbard, and a delicate cameo carved from onyx and rubies.

THE RAPE OF EUROPA by Lynne H. Nicholas Macmillan Pounds 20, 498 pages Art and war usually lie at the opposite ends of human experience, although they meet sometimes in literature. But the fine arts presuppose peace: the opportunity for the creation of painting and sculpture, and the repose needed for their enjoyment, are fruits of tranquillity. What, then, when art and war enter a different relationship, when destructive, all embracing modern war threatens to incinerate art galleries, demolish cathedrals and museums, reduce statues to rubble, annihilate in seconds the rich distillations of culture which have formed over centuries?

An ancient red figured Greek kylix, or drinking cup, was recovered backstage at Sotheby's this spring and has been returned to the Manhattan couple who lost it in a burglary three years ago. Robert Guy, an associate curator at the Princeton Art Museum, was previewing a June antiquities sale at the auction house when he recognized the kylix, which he, as a specialist in Attic pottery and a careful reader of the Stolen Art Alert in IFAR Reports, knew was stolen. The timing of his visit was fortuitous; the man who had brought it in for an estimate had returned to collect it and was waiting in the hall.

Manuscripts and books are unquestionably the strength of the 'Splendours of Flanders'. Among single leaves detached from illuminated manuscripts are several by the famous master, Simon Bening.

To do that was a special project. The building is a work of art. We had to respect at every turn the character of this landmark structure, said the medievalist who moved from the rarified atmosphere of art history theory to a comfortable position as ceaseless champion of his world class museum.

Bergman is satisfied with the effort, financed with $1 million in city funds, $1 million in state funds and another $4 million in contributions.

In fact, he considers the workmanship he got for the money a bargain, pointing out how the wood in new doorways matches original woods and marble painted sculpture bases mimic the marble columns for a consistent look.

Going room to room, Bergman marvels at the miraculously preserved royal jewel cabinet in wax and wood made for Marie Antoinette; a collection of European porcelains considered second only to the British royal collection at Windsor Castle; and some of the nearly 1,000 pieces of jewelry spanning the styles from ancient Egypt to art nouveau.

The installation includes a 19th century alcove modeled on a French goldsmith's shop for Walters' delicate Faberge enamels, an iris corsage ornament created by Tiffany and Co. and an ivory orchid comb by Lalique.

The gallery went up between 1904 and 1909, and before Walters' death, he would open the doors a few times a month, charge admission and donate the proceeds to charity just as his father, who began the collection, had done.
