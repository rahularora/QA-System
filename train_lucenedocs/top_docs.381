All of Mr. Sondheim's best work has a malicious humor that is to musicals what Gary Larson's The Far Side is to cartoons. In Assassins, the macabre Larson lurking inside Mr. Sondheim shows his fangs more than ever, and right from the start. In the opening scene, a carnival barker urges folks to step right up to a game of Shoot the President.

Add one more issue to the list of conundrums Congress will have to unravel when it returns from its summer recess next month: whether the tallest mountain in North America should be renamed. It's a perennial duel between an Ohio congressman protecting the honor of William McKinley, the 25th U.S. president after whom the peak is named, and an Alaska senator defending his state's right to name its own land features. The motives of Sen. Ted Stevens, R Alaska, are easy to discern.

Ever since the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901, American financial markets have always paid tribute to the death of heads of state by shutting up shop. But in closing down for an entire session to mark the passing of Richard Nixon, the New York Stock Exchange has ruffled a few feathers and not solely because people feel that Nixon, the only US president to resign in disgrace, might merit something less than the full treatment. At least two other exchanges, Nasdaq and the Pacific Stock Exchange, unabashedly say they would have preferred to remain open but were forced to follow the Big Board's lead for technical reasons only.

Four years after record breaking cold forced an indoor inaugural, George Bush must cope with the vagaries of Washington weather in planning for his presidential oath taking.

But on Friday, Oct. 25, 1929, the Hoover administration's attorney general, William Mitchell, announced in an address at the American Bar Association's annual banquet that the Department of Justice would deal vigorously with every violation of the antitrust laws. He also revealed that the department had not given clearance to a single proposed merger since the administration had been inaugurated in March, and that it would abandon the practice altogether. The Dow Jones average, which had fallen 6% on the preceding Wednesday, dropped another 13% on the Monday and 12% on the Tuesday following Mitchell's speech.

Rescuers believe they were within 200 feet of Hairoaki Ito when he died Sunday. Ito and a companion had become separated from five other climbers in their party, most of whom had reached the summit Saturday, said Bob Seibert, chief mountaineering ranger for the National Park Service.
