Ten years ago, guerrilla chieftain Robert Mugabe put pen to paper in London to end a bloody seven year war for control of his homeland, Britain's last colonial outpost in Africa known as Rhodesia. That all party peace pact signed on Dec. 21, 1979, silenced the guns and led to the birth of black governed Zimbabwe four months later. A decade later, as president of Zimbabwe, Mugabe is on the receiving end of offensives across the eastern border by rebels based in Mozambique.

Mugabe said Chissano asked him on July 10 to join Moi as a mediator to end the fighting that, coupled with mismanagement and a weak infrastructure inherited from Portuguese colonizers, has placed Mozambique among the world's poorest nations.

We know from our experience it's hard to beat guerrillas. But these people are just bandits and at least we know exactly how they think and what they might do next. The guerrillas, known by the Portuguese acronym RENAMO, originally were formed by the Rhodesian intelligence service in 1977, two years after Mozambique's independence from Portugal, to harass nationalist guerrillas directed by Robert Mugabe from inside Mozambique during Zimbabwe's 1973 79 independence war.

THE biggest effort yet to solve poverty stricken Mozambique's 16 year civil war gets under way in Rome today where President Joaquim Chissano is due to meet his rebel opponent for the first face to face peace talks. Observers say there is a new found sense of realism on both sides at the talks, born of a recognition that Mozambique and its 15m people simply cannot take another year of fighting, famine and destruction. The success of the talks is critical to averting widespread starvation caused by the worst drought in Mozambique's history but exacerbated by the war which has made 70 per cent of the country insecure, and has forced at least 4m people to flee their homes.

Botha of South Africa, on his first summit level mission into black Africa, met Monday with leaders of Mozambique's Marxist government, which has blamed much of its woes on Botha's nation. President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique shook hands with Botha at an airfield welcoming ceremony, then took him on a tour by jeep of the nearby Cahora Bassa hydroelectric project before a two hour meeting. Afterward, Botha said he invited Chissano to visit South Africa and the two leaders issued a joint communique affirming their support for regional cooperation.

In the gnarled branches of ancient baobab trees hundreds of pelicans from Mozambique peacefully nest, giving rise to a local joke that even the birds have fled the civil war next door. During one of the incessant deluges that turn the rich farmland into marshes this time of year, Manuel Thomo and his family, human refugees from the war in Mozambique, huddled around a camp fire beneath the branches of another baobab tree, a temporary home for them and several other families. Rag clad and diseased, hungry and frightened, more than 400,000 Mozambicans have crossed into neighboring Malawi in the past 17 months to escape fighting at home between guerrillas and the government.

Talks between South Africa, Mozambique and Portugal (which built the dam during its colonial rule here) to rehabilitate the power project have sparked optimism that Pretoria, the dominant political and economic power of southern Africa, is ready to back up its good neighbor rhetoric with action. If so, a meeting in Lisbon of the three countries this month could complete plans to put Cahora Bassa back on stream by year's end. If Cahora Bassa goes through, it will be the first concrete achievement of South Africa in regional cooperation, says Melissa Wells, the U.S. ambassador to Mozambique.

BFN <F P=106> [Report from Nampula by correspondent Edmundo Galiza Matos] </F> [Text] At mass rallies held in the capitals of Malema and Lalaua Districts of Nampula Province today, President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano said the promoters of war in Mozambique have begun to return to the country, because they are convinced conditions have already been created to take the reins of power. Speaking to large crowds, Chissano mentioned the cases of Portuguese nationals currently residing in South Africa and Portugal as the ones returning to Mozambique, where they have launched a campaign to discredit the Mozambican Government. Chissano said the campaign is based on the old colonial principle that blacks have never been able to govern themselves.

THE OPPOSING leaders in Mozambique's civil war signed an accord yesterday which could bring peace to the country for the first time in three decades. At a ceremony in Rome, President Joaquim Chissano and Mr Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Renamo rebels, agreed to end hostilities in the 16 year civil war by October 1. The war, which followed a guerrilla conflict seeking independence from Portugal, achieved in 1975, has devastated the already impoverished country.

We've done our best to publicize our views in Mozambique and we've told the South Africans of our concern, Ms. Rosenberg told the House Foreign Affairs African subcommittee. The Mozambique National Resistance, known by its Portuguese acronym of RENAM0, has been fighting the government for 12 years, starting shortly after the nation won independence from Portugal. Thousands of Portuguese colonists fled Mozambique to neighboring South Africa and many support RENAMO.

The document, submitted at the party's first national congress since 1983, says Frelimo, the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, remains committed to socialism. But it deletes references to the class struggle and says party members should express the aspirations of the entire people.

Chissano continues to accuse South Africa of supporting the rebels in violation of a 1984 non aggression pact, a charge Pretoria denies. However, Mozambique's decision to renew high level contacts with South Africa suggests it forsees no quick military solutions to the war, which the U.S. State Department says has claimed an estimated 100,000 lives in the past three years. The fighting in northeastern Nampula province, visited recently by a group of Western journalists, is representative of the deadlocked war in many parts of Mozambique.

Mozambique's first multi party elections were back on course last night after Mr Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the country's former rebel movement, reversed his eve of poll decision to stage a boycott. The Renamo leader changed his mind under intense pressure from the United Nations, western countries that have helped fund the elections, and from neighbouring states, including South Africa. It would have been made clear to him that he could expect no sympathy from either regional or international governments, and Mr Dhlakama may well have been warned that the frontline group of southern African states were prepared to offer military assistance to the newly elected government of Mozambique should Renamo resume its guerrilla war.
