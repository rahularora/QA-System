The bad tempered, high kicking African ostrich can run at 60 mph, but that's not fast enough to escape a group of breeders who see the world's largest bird as a nonstop profit machine. The breeders say there is increasing demand for their feathers, skin and high protein, low cholesterol meat. Along with ostrich meat's newfound popularity among stressed executives and health nuts in Western industrialized nations, the Japanese have taken to preparing it sushi style and eating it raw, says breeder Kevin Grant.

The birds do not stick their heads in the sand to avoid danger a terribly damning myth, ostrich owners lament but they are prone to unrelenting pecking, running around at speeds in excess of 45 mph and generating enough force with their two toed feet to, in the words of one expert, 'disembowel a lion'.

There are other problems. Chicks often have a high mortality rate, usually a consequence of indigestion or inclement weather; the market for many ostrich products, particularly meat, remains untested; and prices are highly volatile. Volatility may not be such a drawback, however, as US farmers are well known for having a strong speculative streak.

The Agriculture Department said Friday it is expanding its recent ban on ostrich imports to include related flightless birds such as emus, rheas and cassowaries because they may carry disease bearing parasites. Larry B. Slagle, acting administrator of the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said the expanded import ban was effective immediately and would remain indefinitely. We must curtail the entry of flightless birds into the United States until further notice to ensure that these birds do not introduce disease carrying parasites to U.S. livestock, he said.

A preliminary report by the Agriculture Department shows farmers spent $118.4 billion on production expenses last year, up 7.5 percent from $110.1 billion in 1987. Despite the increase, 1988 expenditures were still far below the record level of $131.8 billion in 1981, just before the general financial crunch that stalled expansion in the nation's agricultural sector By 1986, annual spending by farmers dropped to less than $106 billion, indicating massive cutbacks in capital investments as land values plummeted and debts burdened many. According to the report issued Wednesday by the department's National Agricultural Statistics Service, 1988 expenditures were higher for all major categories except interest, which decreased 3.7 percent to $8.37 billion, and building and fencing, which dropped 10.3 percent to $2.23 billion.

Two Oklahoma ranchers say their Nebraska counterparts should get their heads out of the sand, and join their boom industry raising ostriches. Mike and Doug Stickler told farmers at the Nebraska State Fair they dropped out of the cattle feeding business three years ago to concentrate on ostriches, those big, long necked birds who can gallop at 45 mph for 30 minutes and can kill you with a swipe of a foot.

The fact that Namibia's ostrich industry has been virtually brought to a standstill by uncontrolled exporting and smuggling of the birds, and the ban on exporting (?the birds) by South Africa, have increased the value and demand for ostriches in overseas markets, prompting smugglers and racketeers to move into the multimillion dollar industry.

Some people predict that 3,500 U.S. owners of 12,000 llamas will begin to price themselves out of the market, even if camelid wool is sought by handspinners and weavers, and the pack animals are used in sorts of fund raising events, the report said. Llamas, fabled pack animals in the Andes of South America, are often used for that purpose by the USDA's Forest Service when venturing into wilderness areas because they are less intrusive on the environment than horses and mules. Unlike llamas, water buffalos aren't in great demand, the report said.

An African tick brought to the Caribbean by accident poses a threat to Florida's cattle, sheep, goat and white tailed deer, say state veterinary scientists who are trying to develop a vaccine. The ticks can cause a skin condition or heartwater disease that can kill up to 90 percent of infected animals, University of Florida scientists say. If the disease spreads to Florida, we probably would have to quarantine the whole state.

The Environmental Protection Agency says the fear of catching Lyme disease from tick bites is causing people to use insect repellents in potentially harmful ways. The EPA, which regulates the pesticides used in insect repellents, said Friday that misuse of repellents could result in adverse skin reactions, headaches, mood changes and possibly convulsions or unconsciousness. Only a small number of reports of ill effects have been received, but they have prompted concern that fear of Lyme disease or the use of repellents for other biting pests may result in misuse or overuse of these products, the agency said.

The service already administers the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, a 2.7 million acre wild area just north of Nome. There is no comparable preserve on the Soviet side. Such a park could make it easier for scientists to conduct research on both sides of the border and make it easier for wildlife biologists to track migratory species such as walrus moving between the two countries.

There is no comparable preserve on the Soviet side. Such a park could make it easier for scientists to conduct research on both sides of the border and make it easier for wildlife biologists to track migratory species such as walrus moving between the two countries. In the last Ice Age, the strait was dry, which permitted people and animals to move between Asia and North America.

State governments, squeezed hard by rising milk, orange juice and cereal prices, are making cuts in a federally funded program that furnishes food to needy women, infants and children. Thirty six of 44 state governments responding to a recent survey said they were cutting their portions of the $2.1 billion Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, also known as WIC. The survey was taken by the National Association of WIC directors.

Joseph, resplendent in a red and blue apron labeled Carver, brings a gigantic spearlike skewer over to the table, plunks its point down on a plate, and asks: Ostrich? He carves a charbroiled hunk, deftly removes his spear without further loss of life, and announces ostrich gaily at each place before shaving some off with a fierce looking blade.

In Zimbabwe, where records are actually kept, from 1982 to 1987 the central government handed back only 49.5% of the revenue generated from wildlife to a fairly representative district, Nyaminyami, along Lake Kariba in the northwestern corner of the country. A group of local councilors and residents called the Nyaminyami Wildlife Trust with more than a little help from the Save the Children Fund and other aid groups are trying to return the benefits of wildlife to those who directly bear the costs, i.e.

Operation Desert Shield, along with holding off Iraqi soldiers, is also shielding the desert from another force that each year devastates Saudi rangeland: millions of Iraqi sheep. An inadvertent side effect of impending war, conservationists say, is that Iraqi herders have ceased their traditional migration across the border to find pasture for sheep, goats and camels. That, they say, is no small windfall to Saudi Arabia, where a loss of plant cover threatens to convert arable range into wasteland across much of the country.

The outbreak is a potential threat to the multi million dollar poultry and ostrich export trade, if left uncontrolled. The Department of Veterinary Services has mounted roadblocks on all roads out of Sengwe and Matibi Two and vehicles are being searched to ensure they are not carrying chickens, chicken meat, eggs or chicken cages.

The possible link between the dinosaurs of 140 million years ago and today's birds is explored on PBS this week in a fascinating edition of the Nova series called The Case of the Flying Dinosaur. The show, second of three Nova episodes about dinosaurs, plays Tuesday at 9 p.m. on Channel 9.; The dinosaur/bird theories spring from scientific attempts to search out the origin of birds by studying fossils from the Mesozoic Era. ; Scientists can see links between existing birds and reptiles such as the presence of scales and births from hard shelled eggs but there are many differences, too, between cold blooded reptiles and warm blooded birds.
