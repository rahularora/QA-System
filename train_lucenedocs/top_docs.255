RE SHOE LACE LTD Chancery Division: Mr Justice Hoffmann: December 20 1992 A DEBENTURE creating an all monies floating charge, executed by a company two months before presentation of an insolvency petition in consideration of advances already made to it by its parent in anticipation of the debenture, is invalid in that the charge was not created before or 'at the same time as' the payments were made, having regard to the ordinary meaning of those words in a commercial and regulatory context. Mr Justice Hoffmann so held when granting an application under RSC Order 29 rule 10 by Mr Dermot Justin Power, liquidator of Shoe Lace Ltd, for an interim payment in respect of his claim for return of company funds paid to the first respondent, Sharp Investments Ltd, a company allegedly controlled by the second respondent, Mr Chandru Mahtani.

Most horseshoes today are still metal and are nailed to a horse's hoof. But synthetic and plastic shoes that are glued to the hoof are beginning to take over. I think in 10 or 20 years the standard horseshoe we've known for hundreds of years'll be obsolete, Kester says.

All around them were tables piled high with sweets ranging from strawberry shortcake to truffles to mini quiches to keep their energy levels up.

While Richard Nixon was on the West Coast to open his presidential library, actor Jim Cooke did what he could here Wednesday to revive the reputation of another maligned president, Calvin Coolidge. He brought his one man show, More Than Two Words, to the National Archives auditorium to repeat the wit and words of a chief executive who is usually pictured as possessing little of either. The show's title comes from a Coolidge story, perhaps apocryphal.

This is an unnecessary shame: a holiday wardrobe, like any other, requires only a little imaginative application and a modicum of self knowledge.

ITALIA EXPRESS (FT, January 14) A vessel was sunk outside Piraeus harbour and the underwriters alleged that there had been a plot to blow up the ship.

At first instance, it was held that the tapes were not admissible in evidence under the Civil Evidence Act 1968. Allowing the appeal against that decision in part, the Court of Appeal stated that insofar as the tapes related to evidence of facts stated by one of the alleged conspirators, GDV, who knew that the conversations were being taped and who supplied the tapes, GDV was quite deliberately making simultaneous statements both orally and in a document.

The defendant issued proceedings in Italy where it was held that there was no arbitration agreement. Article 1(4) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Convention 1968 provided that the Convention did not apply to arbitration and the Court of Appeal, on the plaintiff's appeal against a dismissal of its application to restrain the defendant from pursuing the action in Genoa, referred to the European Court questions on whether the exception under article 1(4) extended to litigation as to the initial existence of an arbitration agreement. The ECJ held that the exclusion did extend to litigation, which was pending before a national court and which concerned the appointment of an arbitrator, even if existence of an arbitration was a preliminary issue in that litigation.

Nike Inc. plans to spend 17 percent of its $30 million basketball shoe advertising budget this year on public service type messages encouraging youngsters to stay in school. The campaign comes at a time when some critics have blamed high priced athletic shoes for triggering crime in poor urban areas. Some children wearing the shoes have been attacked by other youngsters who covet them as status symbols.
