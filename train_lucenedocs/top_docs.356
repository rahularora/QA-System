A few men console themselves by saying that Valentine's Day is a foreign holiday with a short postwar history.

Britain's top two confectioners, Cadbury Schweppes PLC and Kit Kat maker Rowntree PLC, have become tempting targets for U.S. and Swiss bidders in what the British have dubbed the candy bar wars. The bidding and stake building reflect a trend among consumer companies to go global by acquiring existing, strong brands, which are almost prohibitively expensive to create from scratch, analysts say. The moves also reflect Swiss companies' concerns about the approach of 1992, when the Common Market is to become one barrier free market of 320 million consumers.
