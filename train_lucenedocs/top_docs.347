MR Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister, yesterday suggested that the planned European Monetary Institute could start actively co ordinating the monetary policies of EC member states with low inflation after it starts operations in January. At a seminar on economic and monetary union organised by the Federal Trust for Education and Research and Salomon Brothers International, Mr Maystadt floated the idea of low inflation EC countries agreeing a common monetary growth target. The EMI could then use this to organise monetary co ordination and monitor progress towards the achievement of durable price stability in the Community.

EUROPE is entering a 'test phase' for monetary union, when individual central banks have it within their power to create a solid basis for it, the president of the Bundesbank said yesterday. Countries now had to prove the credibility of their national monetary policy, rather than engage in disputes over the framework of European monetary union (Emu) as set down in the Maastricht treaty, Mr Hans Tietmeyer told the VWD news agency. This would be the only way that monetary union had a chance of being successfully implemented in practice, Mr Tietmeyer cautioned.

According to Mr Maystadt, the planned European Monetary Institute, which is due to begin operating in Frankfurt in January, is the ideal institution to iron out such wrinkles and demonstrate consistency of decisions among national central banks in the run up to stage three.

ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN in Europe has cast doubt on the ability of European Community member states to meet the timetable for monetary union contained in the Maastricht treaty, according to a Commons committee report published yesterday. The Treasury and Civil Service committee's report says it is not confident that seven of the 12 member states, including Germany, will be able to fulfil the convergence criteria in time for monetary union in January 1997. It will not be achieved before 1999 if Germany does not meet the criteria within the next four years, says the committee, but in view of Germany's present difficulties this may not happen.

EUROPEAN Community leaders are likely to back Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy next week as a compromise candidate to head the European Monetary Institute, forerunner of a European central bank. Mr Lamfalussy was nominated for the post by EC central bank governors yesterday in a move which increases the likelihood of a deal at next week's Brussels summit on the sensitive question of where to site the European central bank. Frankfurt is the leading contender.

Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, said this week he hopes the EMI will ease the 'frustrations' of having to wait 'week by week' for the Bundesbank to lower interest rates. So far, member states have failed to agree on the EMI's location or its president.

EC LEADERS yesterday restored a semblance of unity to the European Community with a decision to base the future European Central Bank in Frankfurt as part of a wide ranging agreement on the location of EC institutions. But the deal struck at a special European summit in Brussels followed an acrimonious battle over the division of 'Euro spoils', including veto threats by the UK and Spain unless they got the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products. After several hours of haggling, the prize went to the UK which immediately praised the deal as creating several hundred jobs and confirming Britain as a world leader in the pharmaceutical industry.

All this may simply be letting off steam; but it may also suggest that the debate on the future course of the EC may be about to begin. For if Euro sceptics and Euro enthusiasts agree on anything, it is that Maastricht settled nothing.

Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, warned strongly yesterday against rushing towards European monetary union before a joint monetary policy had been worked out and full central banking independence achieved. He was speaking the day after Mr Giovanni Ravasio, the European Commission's director general for economic and monetary affairs, had held out the possibility of Emu as early as 1997. Mr Tietmeyer said: 'I am convinced that monetary policy integration in Europe can only be the outcome of a lengthy process.

EU member states have turned a corner and could realistically consider the prospect of a single European currency, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute, forerunner of the European Central Bank, declared yesterday. Falling interest rates, low inflation and close monetary co ordination among EU central banks had substantially reduced currency instability, Mr Lamfalussy said. In one or two years, there could be some 'pleasant surprises' among countries aspiring to join the planned economic and monetary union.

MR Phillipe Maystadt, finance minister of Belgium which presides over the EC, yesterday hinted at a plan to create a 'dual anchor' for the ERM, with the D Mark locked to a new form of 'hard' Ecu, or European currency unit. The plan is due to be unveiled next month by the European Parliament's monetary affairs committee. Its essence is that the European Monetary Institute (EMI), due to be set up by January in Emu's second stage, should assume more quickly the functions of the European central bank it is meant to prefigure, by issuing and managing the Ecu as a joint anchor to the system alongside the D Mark.

MR JACQUES DELORS, president of the European Commission, will today begin a campaign to breathe life into the Maastricht treaty to build up momentum ahead of Friday's special EC summit in Brussels. Working with the Belgian Presidency of the EC, Mr Delors will call for closer macro economic co operation and a strengthening of the faltering EC 'growth' initiative at a meeting of EC finance ministers today in Luxembourg. The meeting marks the start of an intensive round of European diplomacy which could end on Friday with a decision on the site of a future EC central bank, more openness in the Community, and new 'joint actions' to intensify humanitarian operations in former Yugoslavia and monitor the parliamentary elections in Russia set for December.

The Bundesbank is actively promoting the notion that the proposed European central bank should follow its example and set monetary policy according to a money supply measure, while the Bank of England is promoting its more eclectic approach of steering policy according to an inflation target. Here, too, Lamfalussy is relatively sanguine.

Sir Brian was in Paris, accompanied by Mr Pen Kent, an associate director at the Bank of England, as part of a Pounds 1.5m campaign by the City to try to bring the future European central bank (ECB) to London. It was the latest move in an acrimonious tussle over the site of the EC's planned supranational monetary institution, a dispute primarily pitting Britain against Germany, which has lodged a strong bid to make Frankfurt the ECB's home.

Even then, there would be no guarantee that abandonment of national currencies such as the D Mark or sterling in favour of the Ecu would be politically acceptable to the peoples of Europe.

The official view is that Franco German differences were not so serious as to overwhelm the European monetary system.

' German officials made it clear they believe that Britain remains the only EC member state opposed to Frankfurt, but they also recognise the political difficulty for Mr John Major, the British prime minister, should the bank be sited there. There was considerable embarrassment in Bonn yesterday over the report, confidently published by Handelsblatt, Germany's business newspaper, that Frankfurt had won the battle for the EMI. They fear that, by reviving the question just as the British parliamentary debate on Maastricht is coming to its climax, British capitulation will be less likely.

BELGIUM opened its EC Presidency yesterday with a pledge to 'play by the rules' of the Community and a warning that the difficulty of enlargement negotiations had been underestimated. The two statements by Mr Jean Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister, underlined a shift in priorities after two nationalist minded presidencies under Denmark and the UK, both of which pushed for speedy enlargement with Finland, Sweden, Norway and Austria. Mr Dehaene, who shares a passion for federalism and football, listed Belgium's priorities as giving life to the Maastricht treaty and strengthening EC institutions, particularly the European Commission.

MR Karl Otto Pohl, who resigned after 11 years as president of the German Bundesbank two years ago, has broken his silence and has spoken out about 'defects' in the Maastricht treaty on European union. In two lectures this week at the London School of Economics, the man who was once Europe's best known central banker and is now part time chairman of the well capitalised Cologne based Sal Oppenheim private bank, left a 500 strong audience in no doubt of his scepticism about the likely impact of the European Monetary Institute. The EMI is being set up in Frankfurt next year to supervise the next stage of the planned move to European economic and monetary union (Emu).

Meanwhile, the EMI president can nevertheless imagine other sorts of arrangements between member states, such as those concluded in August 1993 between Germany and the Netherlands to maintain a stable link between the Deutsche mark and the guilder; asked about Mr. Delors' recent statement that the first stage of EMU was a failure and that study should begin on how to boost the second stage, possibly by giving the EMI greater responsibilities, Mr. Lamfalussy voiced some reluctance regarding an expansion of the EMI's powers even before he has begun to work on the basis of existing prerogatives.

EU finance ministers yesterday left open the door for a move to a single European currency in 1997 with a carefully couched endorsement of the current wide fluctuation bands in the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The 1997 date for the creation of a monetary union in Europe is still viewed as a remote possibility only, but the decision in Brussels yesterday underlined political commitment to the Emu project. The 15 per cent fluctuation bands were introduced as a temporary measure after the currency crisis in 1992 93 which forced several devaluations and the departure of sterling and the lira from the ERM.

THE MAASTRICHT timetable for European monetary union is now 'totally unrealistic', Mr John Major said yesterday, as he claimed that the emergency steps taken to salvage the exchange rate mechanism vindicated his decision to suspend sterling's membership last September. As government loyalists and Euro sceptics alike sought to draw comfort from the day's events, which also saw Britain become the eleventh European Community state to ratify Maastricht, the prime minister said he hoped the decision to allow wider fluctuation of currencies within the ERM would promote economic recovery in Europe. In the timetable, if a commencement date for stage three of monetary union has not been set by the end of 1997, then Emu must in any case go ahead by January 1999.

BRITAIN appears ready to drop its claim to base the European Monetary Institute, the core of the future European central bank, in London. The pending shift would clear the way for a deal at the European Community summit on October 29 to locate the EMI in Germany which has recently stepped up its campaign in favour of Frankfurt. Officials in Brussels said the UK government's readiness to soften its position reflects a tactical calculation that it is no longer worth fighting a losing cause against German claims which are supported by the rest of the Community.

THE EC has sharply downgraded its economic forecast for this year, according to internal estimates which the European Commission plans not to release until after tomorrow's Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The revised forecast of zero to 'slightly negative' growth compares with earlier official predictions of 0.75 per cent growth. The slowdown threatens to push EC unemployment beyond its present level of 17.4m, renewing doubts about member states' willingness to follow Maastricht's tough 'convergence' criteria for European monetary union.

Half forgotten pledges in the Maastricht Treaty have gained a new lease of life. The European Commission, in the person of Mr Giovanni Ravasio, its director general of economic and financial clauses, set the ball rolling about ten days ago when he declared that Emu was a 'feasible option' for 1997, the first target date in the treaty.
