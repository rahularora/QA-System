Fostoria, Ohio; A The dew point is the temperature at which moisture would start to condense out of air if the air were cooled. The reason the moisture condenses out is because warm air can hold more water vapor than cool air can. ; Suppose you were in Florida in the summer, and the temperature was 80 degrees, with 91 percent humidity.

So what if two tiny, faraway rocks crumble or sink into the Pacific? Japan might lose fishing and mining rights to 155,000 square miles of ocean, that's what, so it is spending about $236 million to shore them up. The rocks called North Dew and East Dew, each barely large enough for a person to sleep on, are Japan's southernmost points and hold the key to treasure in this age of national economic control zones extending 200 miles from shore.

It must have seemed a splendid idea at the time and Houston Grand Opera during David Gockley's 20 year directorship, has consistently traded in lively ideas about expanding the repertory, as the company track record shows. A specially commissioned new 'Beauty and the Beast' opera, Desert of Roses by Robert Moran, was to be played in alternation with an updating of Gretry's 1771 Zemire et Azor, which has the same theme. Both the new and the old version of the fairytale would have English texts, the Zemire (by Marmontel) translated by John Michael LaChiusa, the Desert of Roses librettist.

A newsroom receptionist fired for her anti abortion activities, including picketing, says her rights have been infringed, but the newspaper says her actions violated its long standing ethics policy. The Milwaukee Journal's dismissal of Diane Dew has prompted the filing of a grievance by the newspaper employees union, an investigation by a state agency and complaints by a religious freedom organization. But Deputy Managing Editor Howard Fibich said the Journal stands by its decision to fire Ms. Dew even though The New York Times and Washington Post did not discipline employees in similar circumstances.

Over 300,000 exempt organizations file annual Form 990 reports so the IRS and the public can check uses and sources of funds. A House Government Operations panel asked the General Accounting Office to evaluate the completeness of the reports and IRS procedures for making them public. Now a GAO draft report based on a sample of 450 forms for 1986 estimates that 48% of 990s omit at least one schedule supplying details of such items as fund raising, loans to and from officers, and mortgage debt.

Few modern operas can claim a more tortuous genesis than Nikolai Karetnikov's Till Eulenspiegel, which has just received its stage premiere at Bielefeld in north Germany. Karetnikov, born in Moscow in 1930, comes from the post Shostakovich generation of Soviet composers who experimented with new techniques and fell foul of the Communist authorities. Till Eulenspiegel was hardly calculated to win official approval.

' Recent developments in the Ruhr illustrate the creeping concentration in the electricity sector. The city of Dortmund has a concession contract, expiring in 1994, under which VEW is its exclusive electricity supplier. Initially, the Dortmund municipal Stadtwerke dreamed of taking over the city electricity supply.

However, sobered by VEW's demands for a payment of around DM1bn for the Dortmund transmission grid, the Stadtwerke agreed to a compromise.

VEW and the Stadtwerke will found a joint supply company, Dortmunder Energie und Wasserverorgung (DEW) for the electricity, gas, district heating and water supply to the city.
