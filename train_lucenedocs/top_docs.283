Azaria's death and the ensuing legal actions convulsed Australia, culminating in Lindy Chamberlain's belated release from jail. Today the Rock is haunted more by the spectre of mass tourism than by the ghost of Azaria.

The 6km walk through the Valley of the Winds is far more rewarding than the haul up Uluru, and you sidestep the heavy breathing queue determined to conquer the Rock.

The evening light is mellow and gold, and takes the startling desert colours to their most intense before fading delicately.

Officials at the New York based Ayer said they handled about $150 million in billings for Burger King last year, split fairly evenly between national and local advertising. We are disappointed, surprised, but not unprepared, Louis T. Hagopian, Ayer's chairman and chief executive, said in a memo distributed to employees. He noted that in the time Ayer held the account, Pillsbury had four different chief executives while Burger King had four chief executives and four heads of marketing.

Burger King's new management moved Thursday to turn around years of erratic advertising results by selecting two new agencies to handle the major portion of its $215 million advertising and marketing account. This is a non traditional approach, but for us it is far more important to be right, rather than conventional, said Barry J. Gibbons, Burger King Corp.'s chief executive. D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles of New York will concentrate on reinforcing brand identity, while Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising of New York will concentrate on day to day brand retailing, Burger King said.

The venture is among the most ambitious efforts yet by an ad agency to tackle TV programming, an area advertisers dominated in the 1950s and are returning to in increasing numbers now. It would allow Ayer's roster of big international clients including American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Gillette and General Motors to produce TV programs not just in the U.S., but in Europe and elsewhere.

Burger King Corp., in an attempt to boost sluggish sales and improve the focus of its advertising, has awarded most of its $215 million account to two New York agencies. The concept of a dual agency partnership allows for synergizing some of the best minds in the advertising business, said Gary Langstaff, Burger King's executive vice president of marketing. The fast food giant's new management Thursday hailed the unorthodox strategy, although some analysts speculated the two agencies D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi could end up grappling for control of the account.

An advertising executive, known as one of the industry's authorities on print media, charged in a $7.5 million lawsuit Wednesday that a Manhattan ad agency fired him because he stutters. David C. Lehmkuhl, 42, was fired in March from his $125,000 a year position at Ammirati &amp; Puris Inc. after four months on the job, according to the suit, which was filed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan. During an afternoon meeting in his office, Edward Vick, the firm's president, told Lehmkuhl he was being fired because, We can't have you getting any closer to the clients, the suit said.

When Ayer and two other top officials suggested to Thornburgh on Jan. 30 that he remove himself from the case and turn it over to the watchdog agency, the attorney general rejected our advice out of hand, Ayer said.

After big business lobbyists complained to the White House and President Bush's counsel indicated concern, the attorney general ordered Mr. Ayer to rescind the endorsement, pending further review. When the decision to back off from the tougher sentencing guidelines became the subject of politically embarrassing news reports, Thornburgh aides blamed Mr. Ayer for acting without approval from his boss. In earlier public missteps, Mr. Thornburgh saw his initial choice for the deputy attorney general's job shot down by Senate conservatives and his recommendation for civil rights chief rejected by Senate liberals.

U2, the sometimes insufferably self righteous rock conscience of the 1980s, also flirts dangerously with the line over which lies unintentional comedy.

Mrs. Chamberlain, who claims her 6 week old daughter was snatched by a dingo, a native Australian wild dog, while on a camping trip in the Outback, says the notoriety has left her broke and prevented her family from living a normal life. Mrs. Chamberlain, 41, who in the past has resented her trial by media, called a news conference with selected journalists Monday to generate publicity to force the Northern Territory government, which prosecuted her and later pardoned her, to pay compensation for the 3{ years she spent in jail.

With ironic hindsight, Fairey describes a child out of place in her environment, who goes East as soon as possible and ends up, just like the father she did not know at the time, a professor. The quest to put together the pieces of the family jigsaw is told with great intensity, an endearing honesty, but not much humour. Ayer, it turns out, had always known about her.

Clubowner Ronnie Scott must be confident of this showy vibraphonist's appeal. The American has already spent a week at Scott's new club in Birmingham and follows now with a three week residency at the London base. But there are few good vibes players around and the instrument does seem to have some pulling power on the margins of jazz: perhaps because it offers both melody and percussion in large, equal measures or because it is played standing up and with some vigour.
