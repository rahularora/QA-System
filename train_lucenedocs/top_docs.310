The real story is an epic in its own right, and the real bridge, a black steel expanse repaired after the war, remains an enduring monument to the Allied prisoners of war and Asian laborers who died building it for the Japanese. ; Unfortunately for their memory, the Bridge on the River Kwai has also become a tourist trap, much to the dismay of many who come to visit the site of their relatives' graves. ; From the bridge's graceful, crescent shaped spans, visitors can look out across the Kwai's waters and see souvenir stands selling Bridge on the River Kwai T shirts, Coke and Pepsi signs in Thai, a foreign exchange van and a dozen speedboats moored in front of a floating restaurant waiting to whisk tourists down the river.

Sir David Lean can only laugh at how calmly Hollywood is taking this year's foreign invasion of the Academy Awards: My Left Foot from Ireland, five nominations including best picture; Camille Claudel from France, two nominations including best foreign film; Henry V from England, three nominations including best director. Yet, it's business as usual at the Oscars. There are, of course, the usual arguments over who made it and who didn't, but nothing like the press conference called by Samuel Goldwyn in 1946, when Lean's Brief Encounter and Laurence Olivier's Henry V were among several foreign films enjoying critical and commercial success.

Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici and Rep. Bill Richardson said the bill introduced Thursday would allow the National Park Service to preserve and interpret the history of the entire Pecos area near Las Vegas, N.M. The planned Pecos National Historical Park would stand on what is now the 5,865 acre Forked Lightning Ranch owned by Ms. Garson. It would include the 25 year old Pecos National Monument, which includes a village dating from the Pecos Pueblo Indians of 1450, the lawmakers said.

<P> David Lean, the recipient of this year's American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award, is the world's leading exemplar of the epic film maker. At 82, he's preparing to direct an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's great, mad novel Nostromo, and already the project is being talked about not only as Lean's Last Stand but, also, as the last great outpost of the epic adventure film. The lionization of Lean is both a tribute to the grandeur of his best work, like Lawrence of Arabia, and a recognition that such grandeur has mostly vanished from the screen.

If you were born before the '60s, chances are that the movies that first opened your eyes were the swashbuckling spectacles. They may not always have been very good, but they suggested reaches of adventure and heroism and history that made moviegoing the most exciting of romances. It's high time to renew the romance.

Xerxes really was a man who did things on the grand scale. Sub soil radar has found the great canal he dug across Mt Athos to bring his navy down safely to southern Greece. Long buried and forgotten, Dr BJ Isserlin and an Anglo Greek team of scientists have located it again with the radar, which looks into the ground from a sledge.

Long buried and forgotten, Dr BJ Isserlin and an Anglo Greek team of scientists have located it again with the radar, which looks into the ground from a sledge. It emits radio waves, like conventional radar, and measures those that bounce back when they hit an interruption a hard task, as all there is to detect underground is the change between the fill and the sides of Xerxes's canal.

A newly restored version of the epic film Lawrence of Arabia, scheduled to open here later this week, previewed Saturday before a star studded audience that included the movie's leading actors, Omar Sharif and Peter O'Toole, and its director, David Lean. The movie, which originally opened in 1962, tells the story of Lawrence's strategy in guiding the 1917 1918 Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire. O'Toole plays Lawrence and Sharif plays his friend Ali.
