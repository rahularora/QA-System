The software is part of Sun's two year strategy of increasing its share of markets, such as corporate offices, that mainly use personal computers tied into networks. Sun has cut prices of some of its machines to less than $5,000, bringing them to PC price ranges, and has persuaded software houses, such as Lotus Development Corp., to adapt their PC software to Sun's workstations. But without a printer software package such as NeWSprint, which includes fonts, or print typefaces, that are compatible with Adobe Systems Inc.'s PostScript, Sun's machines couldn't easily be integrated into many personal computer networks.

This makes it difficult for DEC and HP to keep up with Sun in the workstation business, said Vicki Brown, an analysts at International Data Corp. Sun declined to estimate future sales of the machine, though it said it had already received orders for 5,000 units. However, Ms. Brown said Sun's newest computer is expected to lift sales of its year old Sparcstation family significantly. She said sales of all three models, including the SLC, will probably total 95,000 units this year, roughly three times last year's sales.

The $5,000 price tag brings the computer well into the price range of high end personal computers, which don't run as fast and have poorer graphics.

The new computers, with suggested prices starting at about $8,000, represent Sun's first foray into the crowded personal computer market and will give users the ability to run programs written for either of two popular computer operating systems Microsoft Corp.'s MS DOS, which is widely used in most personal computers, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s Unix, which is the system of choice for engineering and scientific computers. Sun's new computers are a bridge between the commercial world of DOS and the technical world of Unix in a single box, said David Korus, a securities analyst for Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. who follows the small computer systems industry.

Peter Rogers, an analyst with Robertson Stephens &amp; Co., expects Sun's profit to increase 73% to $35 million, or 34 cents a share, from $20.2 million, or 23 cents a share, on a 22% rise in revenue to $725 million from $595 million a year earlier.

They have to be looking over their shoulder all the time, Mr. Herwick added. That's because Sun's workstations run software that uses an industry standard operating system called Unix.

IBM unveiled a line of computer workstations Thursday that the company says outperform and underprice the competition and should help it snare a major stake in a fast growing market where it never had success. The opportunity is big it's growing at over 30 percent a year, and it's mostly a new opportunity for IBM, said President Jack D. Kuehler. The machines, called the RISC System 6000, also mark the first time that the world's largest computer maker has wholeheartedly embraced the Unix computer operating system that is fast becoming the industry standard.

Sun Microsystems Inc. will announce today products that will allow its workstations to be used as intermediary systems between mainframes, minicomputers and personal computers. The new products include SunLink, a package of hardware and software that enables a Sun workstation to connect directly into an International Business Machines Corp. mainframe computer, providing high speed communications capable of transmitting three million characters a second, the equivalent of 1,500 double spaced, typewritten pages. This means SunLink, which will be available in August and will cost about $20,000, can support a network of as many as 128 workstations entering simultaneous transactions.

The low cost Model 705, which has a grayscale display and no disk drive, runs at 35 Specmarks, about 75% faster than Sun's $4,995 Sparcstation ELC.

Sun's new decree, is very hypocritical, says Tony Siress, a director at Single Source, a San Jose, Calif., dealer of Sun machines that also carries clones made by Taiwan's Tatung Science and Technology Inc. Mr. Siress and other dealers are steamed because Sun has long promised not to block companies from cloning Sun's workstations, high performance computers often used by engineers. Sun, despite its No. 1 share of the workstation market last year, needs clones to help it reach its goal of establishing its Sparc chip as the chip of choice in a broad range of computer markets.

Putting all computers into one organization helped the company switch to a single architecture, but the organization became mired in its own complex decision making process involving numerous meetings among the many groups whose components went into a computer. The result was gridlock, as the company tried to build computers by consensus instead of running computer design teams as entrepreneurial units with strong leaders. New machines were regularly delayed in order to accommodate all opinions.

The IIfx costs from $9,696 to $11,497, nearly $3,000 more than the IIci and in the same range as competing workstations. While the new machine won't satisfy critics who blame the company's recent financial woes on the absence of a cheap Macintosh, Apple responded to the call for lower prices by announcing decreases of up to 50 percent on its memory expansion kits for almost all Macintosh systems, as well as LaserWriter printers.

IBM says that by the end of the year it plans to have 1,500 major application software packages and 7,000 total applications available on a par with the numbers Sun can claim. Bill Filip, a senior marketing executive in IBM's workstation operation, said orders have been at the high end of expectations.

Cray's endorsement of Sparc gives Sun, Mountain View, Calif., a high profile ally in its effort to woo a wide range of computer makers to its architecture. Sun's Sparc has been the dominant chip in low end workstation computers used by engineers, but the company is trying to penetrate higher end markets. The Cray relationship will also give Sun the technology it needs to speed up its Sparc chip, which has been overshadowed recently by faster chips from such companies as Hewlett Packard Co. and International Business Machines Corp., said Ms. Goldfarb.

Silicon Graphics Corp. on Tuesday unveiled technology the company said will give personal computer users access to three dimensional graphics previously available only on expensive computer workstations. The company announced circuit boards that fit inside International Business Machines Corp. and IBM compatible personal computers that use Intel Corp.'s powerful 80386 and 80486 microprocessors. The boards, called Irisvision, allow users to move and alter 3 D color images on the screen and instantly see the changes they make, a feature important to scientists and engineers.

The Ventura agreement is a boon for Sun, which is trying to broaden the use of its machines to business offices from the more traditional engineering uses where Sun's machines are extremely popular. To do that, Sun machines need a critical mass of the kind of software businesses use: word processor, spreadsheet, data base and desktop publishing programs, for example. Sun has already won some big time allies in Lotus Development Corp., Wordperfect Corp. and Ashton Tate Co., which have agreed to tailor their programs to Sun machines.
