A soft spoken theoretical physicist, Bardeen was working with two other scientists, Walter Brattain and William P. Shockley, at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., when they developed the first semiconductor transistor in 1947.; The invention was announced in June 1948, and its first commercial use was in telephone switching equipment four years later. ; Invention of the transistor earned the three men a Nobel Prize in 1956 and transformed science and industry. The tiny devices on silicon chips pushed aside the large, inefficient vacuum tubes for portable radios, computers and the miniaturized electronics required for space flight.

From the days when inventor Thomas Edison's light bulb first lit the nights of 1879, Americans have been regarded as naturally inventive and creative. Much of that innovation derives from the work of scientists and engineers at General Electric's Research and Development Center, which traces its roots to the Edison Electrical Light Company formed in 1878 to support the experiments of Thomas Edison. GE scientists brainstormed the magnetic resonance imager, which uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create pictures of internal organs without X rays.

She recounts how the financial strain of legal disputes with RCA forced the Farnsworth Television &amp; Radio Corp. to the verge of bankruptcy, and finally to sell out to International Telephone &amp; Telegraph in 1949.

BFN <F P=106> [Report by Marianela Samper; from the Evening Information </F> Review newscast] [Text] The first international seminar on industrial property and business possibilities in Cuba has concluded in Havana with a positive discussion of experiences by experts and specialists from the 14 nations that gathered here. The debate was enhanced by topics as important as Latin American integration in industrial property [propiedad industrial] and what the subcontinent could do in light of the new challenges posed by the revamping of the international legal order, which is gaining strength. Regarding the use of the patents cooperation agreement, which began (?in May) 1978 under the auspices of the Intellectual Property World Organization [Organizacion Mundial de Propiedad Intellectual], the participants discussed some of the advantages to the countries that adhere to it, including the right to defend claims on inventions in more than 60 countries and the extension of the time granted to applicants before entering the national phase; these advantages allow for further development of the invention, marketing, and facilitate a better financial condition in order to meet other expenditures.

Yuriy Dubinin refused to give his opinion on the fleet's inventory insisted on by the Ukrainian side but stressed that the issue is within the competence of the Ukrainian and Russian delegations. Any attempts to turn the Black Sea Fleet negotiations into a shoot out by unilateral and public statements will have little effect, he said.

The Army has decided to accelerate plans to shield a key control unit in the UH 60 Blackhawk helicopter against radio wave interference after a test incident earlier this month in Europe, a spokesman said Friday. The May 11 incident, in which a Blackhawk flying near a huge antenna farm banked into a right hand turn for five seconds without any pilot commands, also has prompted the Army to instruct its pilots to keep clear of a handful of radio antenna installations in West Germany. Although the May 11 incident has raised new concerns about the effects of so called electromagnetic interference on the Blackhawk, extensive testing has convinced the service it is still dealing with a nuisance problem and not a phenomenon that affects flight safety, said Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman.

Last November, Knight Ridder Newspapers reported investigators were convinced radio wave interference had caused five Blackhawk accidents since 1982, killing 22 servicemen. Radio waves in the air can penetrate the helicopter's wiring and electrical components and generate false commands that can range from simply causing the craft's warning lights to flash to sending it into a fatal dive, the report said.

FIFTY years ago some of Britain's top scientists took over Malvern College in Worcestershire. The move was undertaken with great haste, in deep secrecy and amid farcical chaos. The scientists were ordered to move by Winston Churchill's because they and their existing laboratories were at risk of attack.

Paul Eisler, who died last week aged 85, was a prolific inventor whose major technological innovation the printed circuit accelerated the development of modern electronics. That he amassed neither great wealth nor fame as a consequence of his ingenuity seems to have been a product both of his times and of his somewhat nave and remote personality. Financial reward was rarely at the forefront of his thoughts; he thought of printed circuits primarily as his contribution to Britain's war effort.

His career, while busy and eventful, was also dogged by disappointment and rejection although he betrayed few signs of bitterness in his 1989 autobiography. Eisler's genius was both theoretical and practical; not only did he see that the tangled mass of wires which characterised electrical circuits in the first half of the century could be replaced by metallic tracks bonded to an insulating layer, his experience in printing technology led him to develop a manufacturing method, foil etching, which is still in use today.

TX NEW YORK General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. unit said it is in preliminary talks with a limited number of companies to sell its entire radio group, the business on which NBC was founded. The sale of NBC's radio group would take it out of a business it has been in since the company's formation in 1926. The sale would be a switch of strategy for NBC, which had first said it would reconfigure its radio business by selling some stations and purchasing others.

A big Japanese television maker will stop supplying color sets to General Electric Co. because of a dispute over how a sharply higher yen value should be reflected in the price. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Osaka, sought to increase prices on sets sold to GE for resale in the U.S. under the GE brand name. The price increase was necessary, Matsushita said, because of the significant rise in the yen's value against the dollar.

AMSTRAD, the troubled con sumer electronics group, has rehired the technological wizard behind many of its earlier successes and is looking for a new chief executive as it seeks to restore profitability through growth and acquisition. The strategy includes closing Amstrad's Spanish subsidiary and measures to reduce the company's dependence on the professional personal computer business. Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad's founder and chairman, said that Mr Robert Watkins, who left Amstrad last year to become group managing director at Binatone, had returned to manage Dancall Radio, which Amstrad acquired last month.

The majority of personal computers recently tested by the Federal Communications Commission failed to meet the agency's standards on radio interference, according to a published report on Wednesday. Some 75 percent of the personal computers tested failed to meet the standards, and the consequent interference can disrupt television sets or cause problems with other home appliances and equipment, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Companies allegedly are using a variety of tactics to evade the FCC standards, including instances where a firm will modify a personal computer to pass the tests but will not incorporate the modification in other machines it manufactures.

Jack Nelson, considered the club's patriarch because he reported to work for GE back in 1928, stands up to announce that the widow of a former friend and club supporter is having a garage sale. Lots of old radio equipment will be available.

Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN [Text] Seoul, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) North Korea on Thursday denied as an invented story the recent report that more than 100 North Korean loggers in Siberia were wishing to come to South Korea. According to the NAEWOE press, a radio Pyongyang broadcast said it is just unthinkable that North Korean people try to defect to South Korea. Our people remain convinced that away from the bosom of the Republic, they cannot live even a moment and there is no rewarding future for themselves and their descendants, it said.

BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian at 1000 GMT on 26 May broadcasts a 4.5 minute report that radio and television companies across Russia are going to set up a league as a measure against the law on mass media which is about to be adopted by the State Duma. The announcer says that the proposed law stipulates the creation of the state Duma's exclusive TV and radio service, which, the announcer says, will be financed from the federal budget, thus reducing the amount of financial support presently allocated to other state media. Anatoliy Batyushkin, head of the department of radio and television at the Ministry of Communications, is asked by a Radio Rossii correspondent about the present financial situation in the broadcasting industry.

Good Wives (Radio 4 FM, Thursday) is the sequel to Alcott's Little Women, which has been dramatised in six parts by Marcie Kahan.

Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., which got its start with a break through automatic rice cooker, is looking to bolster its consumer electronics business while moving into higher profit industrial areas, analysts say. The company's products could stock an entire appliance store and then some: radios, tape recorders, refrigerators, air conditioners, video cassette recorders and more. Some of its most widely recognized brands are Panasonic, Technics and Quasar.
