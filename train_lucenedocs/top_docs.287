KATUTURA, South West Africa (AP) Archbishop Desmond Tutu preached Sunday in the territory's largest black township, derided its multiracial government and renewed his call for independence from South Africa. Tutu gave his sermon to about 1,500 people, many in the red, green and blue colors of the South West Africa People's Organization, a guerrilla group fighting for independence. The congregation had gathered to hear Tutu, the first black leader of the Anglican church in southern Africa, in a church near Windhoek, capital of the territory commonly known as Namibia.

Archbishop Desmond Tutu told students that apartheid is so utterly evil, immoral, unbiblical and unchristian that it can only be compared with that equally evil system Nazism. At his installation Friday as chancellor of the University of the Western Cape, the nation's most militant university, the black Anglican clergman also defended his appeals for tough Western sanctions against South Africa. The onus is on those who oppose sanctions to provide a viable, non violent alternative, said the prelate, who is the Anglican spiritual leader for all of southern Africa and winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize.

Archbishop Desmond Tutu, his wife and 34 other activists were arrested today as they began a march protesting the alleged beating of clergy and church workers during an anti apartheid protest. The Anglican archbishop, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, was angered by reports that police earlier today had severely beaten about 20 protesters from the Western Province Council of Churches. The clerics and churchworkers said police used batons and whips to chase them from a security police office in Cape Town, where they had gone to condemn recent detentions of activists.

Archbishop Desmond Tutu offered a public vote of confidence Tuesday for James A. Baker III, saying the new secretary of state is open to new ideas and not dogmatic in discussions with church leaders pressing for sanctions against the white ruled government of South Africa. I don't want to be euphoric, but we certainly have been impressed, said the Nobel Peace Prize winner, who flew to Washington for the early evening meeting between Baker and a delegation sponsored by the World Council of Churches. Tutu said Baker made no promises, but indicated the new administration is reviewing its policy toward South Africa.
