You punt in that situation. Even if you're behind. Tied, you punt for certain.

Even if you're behind. Tied, you punt for certain. </P> <P> Bo didn't.
 LA010290-0050 
Tied, you punt for certain. </P> <P> Bo didn't. His punter took the ball and set sail around left end for 24 yards to USC's 30 yard line.
 LA010290-0050 
</P> <P> Bo didn't. His punter took the ball and set sail around left end for 24 yards to USC's 30 yard line. </P> <P> There goes the old ballgame, right?

A game winning call has just been made. A field goal at least, right? </P> <P> Well, you have to understand Bo and the Rose Bowl.
 LA010290-0050 
A field goal at least, right? </P> <P> Well, you have to understand Bo and the Rose Bowl. What the famine was to Job, the plague to Joseph, the Rose Bowl was to Bo a hoodoo.
 LA010290-0050 
</P> <P> Well, you have to understand Bo and the Rose Bowl. What the famine was to Job, the plague to Joseph, the Rose Bowl was to Bo a hoodoo. A cross to bear.
 LA010290-0050 
What the famine was to Job, the plague to Joseph, the Rose Bowl was to Bo a hoodoo. A cross to bear. </P> <P> Bo's first Rose Bowl game, he had a heart attack.
 LA010290-0050 
A cross to bear. </P> <P> Bo's first Rose Bowl game, he had a heart attack. And the situation went downhill from there.
 LA010290-0050 
</P> <P> Bo's first Rose Bowl game, he had a heart attack. And the situation went downhill from there. </P> <P> It wasn't a game, it was a jinx.
 LA010290-0050 
And the situation went downhill from there. </P> <P> It wasn't a game, it was a jinx. Bo lost two Rose Bowl games because enemy teams failed to punt on fourth down in their own territory.
 LA010290-0050 
</P> <P> It wasn't a game, it was a jinx. Bo lost two Rose Bowl games because enemy teams failed to punt on fourth down in their own territory. Stanford did it to him in 1972.
 LA010290-0050 
Bo lost two Rose Bowl games because enemy teams failed to punt on fourth down in their own territory. Stanford did it to him in 1972. Washington did it in 1978.

Stanford did it to him in 1972. Washington did it in 1978. </P> <P> So, Bo finally turned the tables?

Washington did it in 1978. </P> <P> So, Bo finally turned the tables? Guess again.
 LA010290-0050

Over achievers, really. </P> <P> He may have cost his team this Rose Bowl. The resultant punt, after Bo's tantrum and penalty, from the 21 is barely adequate.
 LA010290-0050 
</P> <P> He may have cost his team this Rose Bowl. The resultant punt, after Bo's tantrum and penalty, from the 21 is barely adequate. USC is in position to mount a closing drive that produced a touchdown with 1:10 left to play.

Billy wrote the city's mayor in November, saying he would save money from his newspaper route to buy tickets for his mother, father and sister Kathryn. </P> <P> I've been a good person for most of my life, Billy wrote.
