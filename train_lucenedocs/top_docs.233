In addition to the facts and figures formally found in a firm's annual report, Southwest Airlines Co. 1988 features fun, in the form of a paper airplane. This was one of those wonderful years when we made a lot of money and it seemed to be we made a lot of money by getting back to the basics. ... and we translated that to what we thought was the most basic of all airplanes, the paper airplane, said Tim McClure, executive creative director of Austin advertising agency GSD&amp;M, which designed the report.

The B 2 stealth bomber, unveiled last fall after more than a decade of secret work, will not fly for the first time before late spring or summer, the Air Force said Friday. Acknowledging recent reports that the schedule for the first flight was in jeopardy, the service said that because of an aggregation of minor system checkout problems, the B 2's first flight is now expected to be in the late spring or early summer time frame. Routine systems checkout of the first B 2 Advanced Technology Bomber is continuing ..., the Air Force added.

The Australian airline Qantas has ordered two Boeing 747 400s and one 767 300 with extended range capability, Boeing Commercial Airplanes said Thursday. The planes will be delivered between September and December 1989 and will cost about $380 million, including spare parts and support, Boeing said in a news release. Qantas Chairman J.B. Leslie said the new planes, which will give Qantas a 43 plane fleet, will serve the growing tourist market to Australia.

And not just military history though that was evoked by such works of martial art as a British Spitfire and a twin engined, twin tailed Lockheed P 38 Lightning but the history of aviation, which has produced some of the most beautiful mechanical objects since the Industrial Revolution.

Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO [Text] Stockholm Saab Aircraft AB announced 17 January in Linkoeping that its new, radar carrying Saab 340 AEW had made its first test flight, which lasted two hours. The structure of the new Airborne Early Warning (AEW) model, which is based on a twinjet commercial airplane with a Saab 340 type propellor, was reinforced to carry a 900 kg radar made by the Swedish company Ericsson Radar Electronics. The rear of the aircraft was altered to hold an auxiliary electrical power system (APU Auxiliary Power Unit) to supply the radar, its cooling device, and the equipment for cooling its computers.

Deliveries of some of Boeing Co.'s new 747 400 jumbo jets will be delayed by a month or so, Boeing Commercial Airplanes said. Dean D. Thornton, president of the Boeing operating company, said Tuesday that of the 161 747 400s ordered by 21 customers, 20 planes will be delivered an average of one month past the previously agreed upon date. We intend to obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification of the 747 400 in December, to deliver the first two aircraft that month and to be back on our original schedule by mid 1989, Thornton said.

Imagine two huge wings from an airplane bolted together without any fuselage in the center. The Air Force says that's the general shape of the new Stealth bomber. Piercing a decade of official secrecy, the Air Force on Wednesday released an artist's drawing of its newest strategic bomber and announced the plane would make its maiden flight later this fall.

Officials at a federal hearing into a jet crash that killed 112 people said Tuesday they are not ready to conclude that a hairline crack in an engine fan disk caused the DC 10's engine to explode. James Nall, the National Transportation Safety Board member in charge of the Sioux City hearing, said no final decision on the cause of the July 19 United Airlines crash will be issued for months, after the full NTSB meets to review testimony. This is simply a portion of the investigation part of the early stages of it, Nall said on the first of four days of hearings.

Canning, in his first statement since charges were dropped, told how he handed the note to a flight attendant after it fell into his lap from a fold out tray after lunch.

Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO <F P=106> [Article by Toshifumi Hirai, general manager of the Aircraft </F> &amp; Ordnance Division of MITI] [Text] The aircraft industry is in a predicament worldwide as a result of cutbacks in defense spending and poor business conditions among the airlines. Although the Japanese aircraft industry has been growing steadily up until now first, in connection with overcoming the handicap of being left behind by the rest of the world as a result of Japan's defeat in World War II and, second, in connection with surviving in the narrow niche in the market it has yet to face many problems that are now known to other high tech industries. Historically, it is a universal fate of the aircraft industry of any nation that it can not live without the support of the government, because of its close ties to the defense industry and because of the huge risks involved in development projects.

Historically, it is a universal fate of the aircraft industry of any nation that it can not live without the support of the government, because of its close ties to the defense industry and because of the huge risks involved in development projects. In addition to that, the Japanese aircraft industry is unique in that the degree of its dependency on defense needs is much higher than that in the United States and Europe; there are only a few manufacturers that are dedicated to aircraft production; defense needs consist of mostly license productions; and the bulk of commercial aircraft and engine productions are also limited to subassembly level productions.

It wasn't quite Lindbergh, but a Texas university professor earned his footnote in aviation history Tuesday when he completed the first trans Atlantic flight in an ethanol fueled airplane. Max Shauck, a mathematics instructor at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, landed at the small Toussus le Noble airport southwest of Paris after a one hour flight from Tours. He set out with Italian co pilot Grazia Zanin from Waco on Sept. 15 in a light experimental aircraft that carried them through often rough weather to Canada, the Azores, Portugal, Spain and finally France.

Kerkorian began assembling his present empire in 1968 with the profit from the Trans International deal. He bought the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas, built the International Hotel &amp; Casino and bought 31 percent of Western Airlines and 48 percent of MGM.

Burt and Richard Rutan have found that the world's first nonstop, around the world airplane trip isn't easy to get off the ground. In 1981, 43 year old airplane designer Burt Rutan and his brother the test pilot Richard, 48, announced their intention to build a plane that would fly more than 25,000 miles around the globe without refueling doubling the world nonstop flight record of 12,532 miles, set in 1962. Five years and 22,000 man hours later, the Voyager appears to be poised finally to take off on its daring flight sometime this weekend.

In fact, an airplane's inertia does not change when it carries out maneuvers at high angles of attack, while its aerodynamic control becomes weak.

Freddie Yetman, technical secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association, said this showed that investigators must have some suspicion of these circuits. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered inspections of 300 Boeing 737s for possible cross wiring of engine warning systems.

Pilot Shut Off the Wrong Engine said the Sun. The Transport Department said that evidence obtained early in the investigation indicated both of the plane's engines might have suffered a related failure and that possibility was still being examined. The statement from the department's Air Accidents Investigation Branch also confirmed that the airplane's left engine caught fire and the right engine was shut down, and that pilot Kevin Hunt had told ground control the fire was in the right engine.
