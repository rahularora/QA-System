A court ordered the mosque closed to people of both faiths in an effort to prevent religious strife. In 1986, another court order opened the Babar Mosque, but only to Hindus.

One thinks of sacred cows, many armed dancing gods, Hari Krishna, titillating stories of tantric excesses, TV epics and yogis who stand for years on one leg. The difficulty most people have is fitting these colourful elements into a coherent picture of the everyday religion of modern India.

In 1885, a Hindu priest filed a lawsuit claiming a small plot of land in the town of Ayodhya was the birthplace of the Lord Rama, the much revered warrior god. The priest also claimed that the unpretentious three domed mosque on the site was built over what had once been a Hindu temple.

Ayodhya was at the center of a controversy between Hindus and Moslems last year and led to the deaths of about 300 people in clashes in three states. Last August, Hindu fundamentalists announced they would build a new temple to their god, Ram, on the site of a 17th century mosque in Ayodhya. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which backs the temple program, maintains the mosque was built atop an ancient Hindu temple marking the spot where the group says Ram was born 900,000 years ago.

INDIA faced a political and constitutional crisis last night after Hindu militants stormed and demolished an ancient mosque in Ayodhya, prompting widespread fears of communal violence across the country. Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, appealed for calm, even as regulatory police orders were imposed and the army alerted in many Indian states. Addressing the nation on television, Mr Rao said his government would go to any length to promote secularism and appealed to every citizen to co operate with it.

A ROW erupted in the Indian parliament yesterday after Hindu militants on Thursday openly defied a court order and began construction of a Hindu temple on the site of a disputed 16th century mosque at Ayodhya. Five thousand Hindu activists from the militant right wing Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) poured into the dusty town near Lucknow with truckloads of gravel and sand, and three concrete mixers as prominent Hindu leaders performed the ritual of pouring gravel on the foundation stone, laid almost three years ago. The Hindus want to build a temple on the site because they say the Hindu god Lord Ram was born there.

AYODHYA, India AP) Tens of thousands of militant Hindus stood guard today with tridents and bows and arrows as priests broke ground for a temple at a religious site claimed by both Hindus and Moslems. More than 1,000 Hindu pilgrims stood solemnly as four consecrated bricks passed over their heads and were placed on the ground as a symbol of the foundation they say they will begin digging Friday. Hundreds of security troops surrounded the disputed shrine, watched from rooftops and lined the roads leading to Ayodhya, a town of 35,000 people some 325 miles southeast of New Delhi.
