A 270 year old Stradivarius violin named after the descendants of composer Felix Mendelssohn sold Wednesday for $1.76 million, the highest price paid at auction for a musical instrument, Christie's said. The violin, known as The Mendelssohn, was purchased by a private buyer in the salesroom who asked not to be identified. It was owned by an American collector for the past 35 years and he probably played it a bit, said William Hanham, the auctioneers' spokesman.

Since A is the tuning note on which other notes up and down are based, first A is tuned in, then all strings are tightened accordingly. With A at 420 hertz, these instruments, which many say are unequaled for tone quality, sounded warm and rich among the few other strings in a small chamber orchestra. But as orchestras and concert halls got bigger, musicians started to tune their instruments sharper, raising the pitch of A and thus all other notes.

EDITOR'S NOTE When she won a national competition for young musicians in her native Germany at age 7, the government allowed her to drop out of regular school and be tutored at home so she could spend more time practicing the violin. Today, at age 25, Anne Sophie Mutter is more than a child prodigy. She's an international star in classical music.

In her strapless Dior gown with a Stradivarius tucked under her chin, Anne Sophie Mutter is the glamour girl among today's young classical violinists. The German born musician is in the fast lane, zipping around in a Porsche 911 convertible at up to 100 mph plus on the Autobahn, vacationing in her apartment in Monte Carlo. A fan club always greets her in Japan.

Up close and personal, Mstislav Rostropovich seems a little shy and frail, wisps of white hair clinging to his head as he walks slowly, almost timidly, onto the Carnegie Hall stage to conduct the National Symphony in a brief rehearsal before the 8 p.m. concert. He looks closer to 70, but March 27 is his 60th birthday, and his management has organized a marathon birthday celebration for him here: 18 concerts between Feb. 6 and March 24, including 10 different programs, 15 cello concertos, two solo recitals of Bach suites and three programs for which he is conductor, including the War Requiem of Benjamin Britten with the New York Philharmonic and his wife, soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, as one of the soloists. All this will be capped by a gala at the Kennedy Center in Washington on the birthday itself.

Along the way, he became one of the concert world's first true superstars, a stage idol who collected million dollar salaries, race horses, homes and old master paintings, but who never lost his feel for the popular music his concert audiences loved. This son of Ireland, though a terrible opera actor, was a tremendous artist whose vocal glory was renowned. It was the great violinist Fritz Kreisler, or in some versions Jan Kubelik, who said McCormack had a Stradivarius in his throat.

LORD Rosebery is disposing of one of the most important paintings in his collection to raise money to repair his family's stately home in Scotland. The painting, a portrait of the religious reformer Johannes Uyttenbogaert, is regarded as one of the finest privately owned Rembrandts in the UK. It is expected to fetch Pounds 3m when auctioned at Sotheby's on July 8.

Pandis, 25, of Chicago, pleaded guilty Tuesday in U.S. District Court to mail fraud and credit card fraud for a series of cons including bilking his father out of $53,000 that began in 1983, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Foley.
