 AP900929-0117 
Lockheed Corp.'s prototype of a 21st century fighter jet made its first flight Saturday in a winner take all competition for the multibillion dollar Advanced Tactical Fighter contract. The YF 22 was airborne just 18 minutes, taking off from Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale and ending 25 mile away at this desert flight test center. The flight was a milestone in a high stakes contest between an aerospace team headed by Lockheed and a team led by Northrop Corp. for 1,250 ATF jets, to be built at a projected cost of $51 million per plane.

Even though the system was purposely overloaded 50 percent beyond its design limit at the time, the Air Force decided to fix the component to ensure an extra margin of safety.

The stealth gets its name from the claim that it will be almost invisible to enemy radar, due to the extensive use of exotic composite materials, some of which absorb rather than reflect radar waves; its lack of sharp surface angles; and a cross section that offers a very small profile to radar.

The federal government will study sites where the Wright brothers lived and worked in a move that could lead to a national park in the birthplace of aviation, officials said Friday. Rep. Tony Hall, D Ohio, said the National Park Service study, expected to take 12 to 15 months, will help Congress decide whether to confer national park status on the sites. A committee headed by U.S. District Court Judge Walter Rice was formed to preserve the heritage of Orville and Wilbur Wright, who developed the first heavier than air flying machine.

The city's report indicates that the kite was between 200 and 250 feet in the air, but the pilot who struck the kite claimed to be at 700 feet, he said.

Riddle, 46, mainly a recreational flier, had previously competed in only two small scale races. But when the opportunity to fly in the Air Race Classic, the Super Bowl of women's aviation races, arose this summer, she teamed with experienced pilot Sally Bocinski. They borrowed a Cessna 172 for the 2,600 mile, four day journey that took the racers to obscure airports in New Mexico, Kansas, Arkansas, Illinois and West Virginia before ending in York, Pa. Riddle, a member of the 99's, an international organization for women pilots founded by Amelia Earhart, is now preparing for a 500 mile, one day race later this month.

Early in the war, the tiny de Havilland Company had answered the panic call for virtually anything that would fly by building a cheap, two engine machine out of plywood, spruce and balsa. It was initially scoffed at, but the Mosquito, which carried nary a defensive gun, had the lowest loss rate of any World War II bomber thanks to its speed, flying altitude and the nearly invisible flicker it produced on radar screens.

The Air Force unveiled its sinister looking B 2 stealth bomber Tuesday, giving the world its first look at the gray and black flying wing designed to evade enemy radar and deliver nuclear weapons. The bomber, which has never been flown, was towed slowly out of a hangar at Air Force Plant 42 in the Mojave Desert to cheers from an invitation only crowd of 2,000 workers, military brass, media and industry representatives. The B 2, built primarily by Northrop Corp., resembles a huge, tailless manta ray, with wide sweeping wings blending smoothly into rounded cockpit and engine housings on the top side.

The Navy also wants its own variant of the ATF, and currently has plans to procure 546 of them to replace the F 14. The YF 22, which was presented while Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries blared over a speaker system, in some respects resembles Lockheed's F 117 Stealth fighter, with its angular airframe.

The Boeing Co. on Wednesday released a photo of a secret unmanned airplane it said made its first flight Sunday. Boeing released few details about the experimental aircraft, other than to say it successfully completed its first flight and would undergo further flight tests to characterize the capabilities of this type of vehicle. The airplane has a long, skinny fuselage with narrow, flexible wings.

 AP890717-0152 
The radar evading B 2 stealth bomber took its maiden flight over the Mojave Desert on Monday, impressing its pilots while crowds cheered and political debate intensified over the costly plane's fate. If we appear a little giggly about all of this, it was a lot of fun, said Air Force Col. Richard Couch, one of two pilots on the test flight. The nearly two hour flight appeared flawless to people who watched the sinister looking flying wing take off from secrecy shrouded Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale shortly after 6:30 a.m. and land at nearby Edwards Air Force Base.

It rests, in pieces, in a grimy corner of a museum warehouse in suburban Silver Hill, Md., long forgotten by the nation that conceived its menacing promise as the least detectable bomber in the skies. Re assembled, it would look like a huge vampire bat or a stub tailed manta ray. Underlying its design was the notion that the enemy wouldn't see it at all, because this jet powered flying wing's skin would be made of composite materials to absorb radar waves, rather than reflect them.

Johnson, who led the design of the U 2, the SR 71 Blackbird and more than 40 other airplanes and spacecraft, died at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank after a long illness, Lockheed said. The illness was not disclosed. Using titanium and sleek shapes, Johnson's designs broke the thermal thicket, the high heat problem of supersonic flight, said Donald Lopez, a senior advisor at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. Use of titanium alloy on the SR 71 rather than standard aluminum made flight at high speed possible despite 800 degree Fahrenheit temperatures.

The U.S. F 14 fighter that shot down Libyan MiG 23 warplanes over the Mediterranean Sea on Wednesday is more maneuverable and has more sophisticated radar and weapons than the Soviet made plane, say retired Navy officers. We have felt that the F 14 has been and continues to be the world's best fighter plane, said retired Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, who served as Chief of Naval Operations in 1970 74. The American pilots were almost certainly better trained than their Libyan adversaries, other experts said.

We don't know what's right with stealth; we don't know what's wrong with stealth, she said. The Union of Concerned Scientists, a private organization, has issued a report challenging the need for such an expensive weapons system, saying that it could destabilize arms control because some of its missions would include destruction of such targets as command centers and mobile missile sites.

The booklet, besides reporting on Southwest's record $57.95 million in profit, traces the construction of a paper airplane from the first folding of the paper to the final painting to resemble Shamu One, Southwest's flying whale jet rolled out last year during the airline's promotion of Sea World theme parks in Texas and California. You think every pre schooler and first grader in Dallas will want one?

Underlying its design was the notion that the enemy wouldn't see it at all, because this jet powered flying wing's skin would be made of composite materials to absorb radar waves, rather than reflect them.

A solar powered airplane is slowly nearing the end of its wind tossed odyssey from California to Kitty Hawk, N.C., the birthplace of powered flight. After more than six weeks, sometimes being blown the wrong way, aviator Eric Raymond still has about 240 miles to go in his 198 pound plane, Sun Seeker. But strong headwinds appear to have dashed his hopes of reaching Kitty Hawk during the Labor Day weekend, said his wife, Aida.
