Mr Gates said Microsoft would begin testing home multimedia services in the US and Europe in 1995. He did not expect substantial returns on his investment for five years, although he thought that there would be substantive developments in multimedia in 1996 97 with entire cities converted to interactive networks. Multimedia and the 'information superhighway,' the high capacity network which will link vast repositories of information with modified television sets or personal computers, are creating intense interest among computer companies, telecommunications organisations and entertainment firms.

For Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, these are trying times. His company is under scrutiny for alleged anti trust violations; Wall Street has soured on the stock; and after 18 years of spectacular growth Microsoft is planning for a 'bumpy' year ahead. Could Microsoft have lost the golden touch that has enabled it to become the largest software company in the world, made Gates, 37, the richest man in the US and created hundreds of millionaires among its employees?

He wants to put Microsoft technology in almost anything that uses electricity. His intention is to make Microsoft software an integral part of office equipment. Gates also foresees Microsoft's involvement in the design of specialist software for 'broadcast' information to and from portable computers over wireless networks, personal information management applications for use on hand held computers, electronic and voice mail from portable systems and the transfer of data to and from desktop systems automatically.

Bill Gates, founder and chief executive of the US software company Microsoft, is his principal target. Credited with a personal fortune of more than Dollars 7bn, Gates is one of the richest people in the US but, most would agree, hard to like. He is arrogant, charmless and possessed of an outsize business aggression which has driven Microsoft to annual sales of more than Dollars 2.5bn but won him few friends on the way.

Alligator hunters are poised to fan out over lakes and canals for the start of the state's second gator season in a quarter century, and hide and meat processors won't be far behind. Under new rules, the 221 licensed hunters must kill alligators immediately by harpoon or bang stick, a hand held device that shoots a .22 caliber cartridge on impact. Last year, most of the 2,979 gators bagged were captured and brought to processors alive.

A change of corporate culture is in store for Michael Hallman, who is trading the presidency of Boeing Computer Services for the same job at Microsoft Corp. Boeing is nearing its 75th anniversary; Microsoft was founded in the mid 1970s. Boeing deals with everything from fax machines to fluid dynamics models; Microsoft focuses on computer software. Boeing has airplane models expected to be in development or use for 50 to 70 years; the software industry has to react to sudden market changes.

Most alligator hunters were disappointed after the first day of Florida's month long gator season, but by Friday morning some lucky ones bagged animals as long as nine feet. Thursday at sunset marked the beginning of the first legal alligator hunt in 26 years for the lucky or not so lucky 230 people granted permits to catch the reptiles with harpoons, nooses, crossbows and almost anything but a gun. The first night of the 30 day hunt netted about 130 alligators in 28 designated hunting areas across the state, according to the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.

Drawn by adventure and hopes of big profits, Florida's 238 newly licensed alligator hunters are getting ready to begin the state's first legal gator hunt in 26 years. More than 5,000 novice and skilled hunters alike scrambled to apply for the permits after game officials announced the hunt, designed to trim an alligator population that was once threatened by poachers but is now an estimated at 1 million. Wide eyed amateurs will be stalking freshwater swamps, lakes and streams with hopes of cashing in on their catch, which can bring as much as $1,000 for a 10 foot gator's skin and meat.

The North American telecoms industry is in the grip of an acquisitions and reorganisational frenzy brought on by a desperate desire to remake itself in advance of the arrival of the much hyped 'digital highway' or 'information superhighway'. Governments and cable television interests also want to get their own way in deciding the path this 'highway' will take, so the rush has been on to make deal after deal that will give telecommunications 'content' to offer users of the highway and enough strategic partnerships to make sure that their particular section of the highway is not a dead end. The truth behind all this hype is that the future could see the creation of two or more digital highways in the US.
