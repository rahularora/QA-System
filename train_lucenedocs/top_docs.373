Jonathan Hayman, his wife, Laura, and their son, Romano, were driving across the Central Kalahari Game Reserve on Feb. 23 when their truck broke down, said Lawrence Wright, a cousin of Hayman. After three days, the Botswana family ran out of food and water and began walking back toward their hometown of Serowe, more than 120 miles away, Wright said.

Standing on South Africa's doorstep, Pope John Paul II called on the people of this desert nation Tuesday to assist victims of racial discrimination who are deprived of their legitimate rights.

Botswana, a landlocked country of 1.1 million people, has never fought a battle in its 22 years of independence despite bordering such turbulent places as Angola, Mozambique, South West Africa and South Africa.

FEATHER FALL: AN ANTHOLOGY by Laurens van der Post Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 16.99, 269 pages Sir Laurens van der Post is not so far short of 90 but, happily, in full possession of his powers as he celebrates this 60th anniversary of his association with the Hogarth Press (today subsumed in Chatto, and in turn in Random House).

The Jwaneng mine, on the fringes of the Kalahari desert in Botswana, is known as 'a gem in the world of gems' because it almost certainly is the richest diamond mine in the world at least in terms of the value of the stones it yields. Jwaneng's position is being reinforced by a USDollars 160m expansion programme at present being completed three months ahead of schedule and under budget. Meanwhile, 160km west of Kimberley in the northern Cape Province of South Africa, another diamond mine, the Finsch, where operations started in 1964, has been given a new lease of life.

All this goes to show that De Beers, the South African group that dominates world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, still has complete faith in its ability to maintain stability in the diamond market despite short term difficulties such as those the company is experiencing with Russia. It also remains intent on maintaining its diamond output even though its 100 year old mines at Kimberley are now running down. The South African group believes that its control of at least 50 per cent of world diamond production gives it a powerful base from which to negotiate with the other producers who have marketing contracts with De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, In Botswana De Beers controls half of Debswana, the company that owns the Jwaneng mine, with the government owning the rest.

Operation Desert Shield, along with holding off Iraqi soldiers, is also shielding the desert from another force that each year devastates Saudi rangeland: millions of Iraqi sheep. An inadvertent side effect of impending war, conservationists say, is that Iraqi herders have ceased their traditional migration across the border to find pasture for sheep, goats and camels. That, they say, is no small windfall to Saudi Arabia, where a loss of plant cover threatens to convert arable range into wasteland across much of the country.

Pifer has produced an entrancing memoir of childhood in pre apartheid days. This book, written with superb precision and elegance, its recall of detail based on access to his beloved mother's letters home, is utterly fascinating about the South Africa of those pre war years, yet it is more than this, it evokes and recreates the intimacy of the life of a happy family of half a century ago.

THERE IS something about February that seems to induce in me a fit of parsimony. This is not normally something that comes naturally, as my husband is the first to rue, but I am taking a perverse kind of pleasure in seeking out ways of spending less without having any less fun. There are, of course, cycles in patterns of expenditure and few of us remain unaffected by the moods that sweep our worlds.

There are, of course, cycles in patterns of expenditure and few of us remain unaffected by the moods that sweep our worlds. What is interesting about the current cycle is while some are forced to cut back for the saddest of reasons (unemployment, redundancy, rising costs) others, whose incomes have not been affected one jot by the current economic woes, also feel unaccountably constrained when it comes to consuming.

Tonight, as we emerged from the acacia forest in Van Wyk's Toyota Land Rover, he gestured sharply to his right: A herd of 50 elephants rumbled away in fright, kicking up clouds of white Kalahari desert sand. But one old bull lingered in a water hole 50 yards from us, oblivious to our intrusion. Van Wyk descended from the vehicle, scattered sand, then, satisfied that we were downwind of the keen smelling, nearsighted beast, silently motioned me forward until we were just a few long strides away.

In his search for an escape from the frustration of playing monarch in waiting, Prince Charles is carving out a niche as an improbable but often effective Voice of the People. His sorties into issues like ocean pollution, unemployment and inner city decay bring him about as close to political controversy as the strictly neutral British monarchy can go. By stretching the bars of his gilded cage, this child of privilege faces the irony of becoming a darling of the left, monarchy's traditional foe.

His research showed that an area called the ventral prefontal cortex, which grew dramatically in modern human brains, serves as a link between speech centers controlling so called automatic vocalizations laughter and crying and those areas controlling more sophisticated speech.

LAST FRIDAY was the day of the annual agricultural show at Prieska in the northern part of South Africa's Cape Province. A few score farmers and their families from a radius of a about 100 km (62 miles) had gathered to wander around about a dozen trade and craft stands, have a braai (barbecue) lunch and to see which of them would be awarded the prize for the best Fat Tailed Persian sheep. The temperature was in the mid 40s centigrade (about 120 deg F).

African elephants are reputed to be impossible to train, being larger and supposedly of more uncertain temperament than their Indian counterparts. While Randall Moore has proved this to be a fallacy, I always felt our trip was conducted on the elephants' terms. Once, when they worked themselves into a frenzy of fear over a non existent danger and finally bolted with us on board, there was little Abu's handler could do about it, in spite of beating him over the head with the bull hook until its fibreglass handle shattered, sending the business end spinning into the undergrowth.

Raymond Dart, a pioneering anthropologist whose once controversial discovery of a link between man and ape is now widely accepted, died after a three week illness. He was 95. Dart died of a brain hemorrhage Tuesday at a clinic near Johannesburg, said a colleague from the University of the Witwatersrand, Professor Phillip Tobias.

HISTORY South Africa has ruled Namibia since capturing the territory of South West Africa from Germany in 1915. The South West Africa Peoples Organization (SWAPO) began guerrilla attacks in 1966, after South Africa rejected a U.N. resolution demanding it relinquish control of the territory. An estimated 20,000 people, mostly SWAPO guerrillas, died in the fighting, which ended in April 1989.

ECONOMY SWAPO was strongly committed to socialism while in exile but, since winning the November election, has spoken more often of working with the mining, farming and fishing industries to create jobs, educate and improve living conditions for the impoverished black majority. South African aid, coupled with the white controlled industries, has made Namibia one of the few African countries to achieve an annual per capita income of $1,000. But the country's wealth is concentrated in the hands of the whites, who make up 6 percent of the population, and South Africa is ending its aid.

In a continent littered with economic disasters, Namibia heads toward independence as a potential success if it can meet the demands of poor blacks without alienating wealthy whites and foreign investors. The desert territory has profitable mining, fishing and farming industries and one of the best infrastructures in Africa, much of it built with money from South Africa. White controlled South Africa has administered Namibia, also known as South West Africa, for 74 years under a mandate from the defunct League of Nations.

BFN <F P=106> [From the Network Africa program] </F> [Text] Prospects of violence are so great in South Africa that it is making hundreds of white people in South Africa flee across the border into the neighboring states of Zimbabwe, Namibia, Swaziland, and Botswana. However, as Derek James now reports from Gaborone, the locals of Botswana have also been making their own panic moves. [Begin James recording] Botswana is attractive to South Africans because of its closeness, stability, and peace.

One such person handed over 300,000 in South African rands, that is 50,000 pounds, into a Botswana bank account last week.
