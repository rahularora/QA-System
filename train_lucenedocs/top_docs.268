In rejecting Mr. Sosnoff's bid for the 25.9 million Caesars common shares he doesn't already own, Caesars cited uncertainties in the offer, including the New York money manager's ability to finance the bid and to win Nevada and New Jersey regulatory approval allowing him to become a casino operator. Caesars said in the SEC filing that Mr. Sosnoff's bid raises serious legal questions under the federal securities law, but didn't elaborate.

Caesars World Inc.'s decision to drop its $960 million recapitalization plan in favor of a stock buy back was praised by financial analysts, although the stock market reaction was less sanguine. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars World shares closed at $29.50, up 25 cents, on volume of 749,600 shares. Under the original recapitalization, devised to fend off an unwanted takeover bid from New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff, Caesars holders would have received a one time dividend of $26.25 a share and stock in the reconstituted company.

Caesars World Inc. said it filed a petition with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission for a rehearing on its proposed $960 million recapitalization plan. The commission rejected the hotel and gambling concern's recapitalization plan by a 4 1 vote Aug. 12. One commissioner argued that the plan, which would give Caesars' shareholders a one time cash dividend of $26.25 a share and stock in the reconstituted company, lacks any clear business purpose and is designed to permanently entrench current management while loading down the company with $960 million of new debt.

The price of Caesars World Inc. stock surged Wednesday after developer Donald Trump surprised the gaming industry by asking the federal government for a ruling on whether he could buy a controlling interest in the hotel and casino company without violating antitrust laws. Trump filed notice on Tuesday with the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission of his desire to possibly purchase more than 50 percent of Caesars World common stock. Although neither Trump nor Caesars will say how much Trump already owns, the filing was made under the Hart Scott Rodino Act, which requires companies or individuals to seek such a ruling once they have acquired at least $15 million worth of stock in a company.

Caesars World Inc., reeling from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission's Wednesday rejection of a proposed $960 million corporate recapitalization, said it is reviewing alternatives that include an appeal or a petition for a rehearing. Meanwhile, the unexpected negative ruling sparked much speculation about what other courses might be open to the gambling concern in its effort to recapitalize. Among the possibilities suggested by industry sources, securities analysts and others is that the operator of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., and Caesars Atlantic City hotel casino in New Jersey might restructure the recapitalization plan to include less debt.

Caesars World Inc., responding to a $28 a share bid by investor Martin Sosnoff, unveiled a recapitalization plan in which it will pay a one time cash dividend of $25 a share and incur about $1 billion of new debt. The owner of casino hotels said it believes the plan is better for shareholders than Mr. Sosnoff's tender offer because it will allow holders to retain their shares and their equity participation in the company's future growth. However, the dividend payment and retirement of $222.5 million of existing debt would wipe out Caesars's shareholders equity and would result in a negative net worth or assets minus liabilities of about $700 million.

Caesars World Inc. said it filed suit in federal court here against Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor who began an unsolicited $28 a share tender offer for the company last week. The gaming concern alleged in its complaint that Mr. Sosnoff's offer, valued at $725.2 million, is illusory and designed to manipulate the market to allow the investor to sell his current Caesars holdings at a substantial profit. Mr. Sosnoff holds a 13.6% stake in Caesars, or 4.1 million of the company's 30 million shares outstanding.

Henry Gluck was in Las Vegas hosting a lavish, televised celebration of the 20th anniversary of Caesars Palace hotel casino last month when he first learned of investor Martin T. Sosnoff's hostile tender offer for his company. The Caesars World Inc. chairman didn't want to spoil the fun or tip off anyone that there was serious business to deal with. So instead of walking off the banquet hall platform to take telephone calls from Mr. Sosnoff and Caesars officials, the tuxedo clad, normally reserved chief executive officer crawled on his hands and knees behind the dais to get to a phone.

Judge William Rea late yesterday also ordered Caesars to delay for at least one month a vote on its proposed $960 million recapitalization plan, which the company designed to thwart Mr. Sosnoff's efforts.
