The seventh large python snake found slithering around the same neighborhood has officials puzzled, but not panicked. Experts are not sure where the snakes have come from, but say rodents are in far more danger than residents. The latest python to be spotted in the 20 block area was captured Wednesday.

Experts are not sure where the snakes have come from, but say rodents are in far more danger than residents. The latest python to be spotted in the 20 block area was captured Wednesday. All seven snakes have been either full grown Burmese pythons or reticulated pythons from Southeast Asia, averaging 12 to 15 feet in length and weighing up to 175 pounds, said Debbie Parker of Wildlife Rescue and Rehab Inc., a St. Petersburg facility that cares for injured or abandoned wild animals.

Zoos, exhibits and reptile breeders all over the United States and Canada are bidding for a 20 foot python found under a home after reportedly having slithered around the neighborhood for years.

Hunters estimate that 500,000 Texas diamondback rattlesnakes were harvested last year, fetching about $50 apiece, but naturalists say the booming business in rodent eating snakes is leading to an environmental bust. Rattlesnakes are a natural part of the ecology it's not like the communists let them go to terrorize Texans, said David Barker, a Dallas herpetologist, or one who studies reptiles. They've been there for a million years.

To show how fresh their product is, Hong Kong vendors bite the snake's head off in front of customers, who get to watch the body of the reptile wriggle through the vendor's fingers as he searches for the organ. The conservation organization World Wide Fund For Nature said it supported the government's licensing decision.

Three men moved slowly along the lip of the canyon, their shadows falling below them, stretching long and dark across a long meadow carpeted in lush green grass and dotted with crimson Hereford cattle grazing peacefully in the early morning sun. Eyes on the ground, each man peered into the crevices and recesses of the white, porous gypsum boulders and into the inner depths of the scattered scrub brush that sprouts near the break where canyon meets plateau. Anthony Felder, the leader of the three, parted the leaved branches of a stubby wild plum and was the first to find the object of their quest.

This, says Bruce Jayne, a coauthor of a study published today in Science, is contrary to what scientists have long believed. Our findings do not support the widely held notion that the energetic cost of terrestrial locomotion by limbless animals is less than that of limbed animals, he said. In plain language, it is as hard to wiggle along as it is to walk along.

To find out how hard a snake has to work to get from one place to another, Jayne and his colleagues got a group of black racer snakes and figured out a way to put them through an aerobic workout.

A researcher who maintains 1,000 venomous snakes for scientific purposes was in serious but stable condition Thursday after being bitten by a deadly Pakistan pit viper, his 148th snake bite. William E. Haast, 78, director of the Miami Serpentarium Laboratories, was extracting venom from the viper Wednesday when it bit his thumb, said John Dwan, spokesman for the University of Utah Health Sciences Center. Haast drove himself to the hospital, but doctors were not immediately able to administer anti venin because Haast was allergic to the stock on hand.

The professor's results, which he recently announced to the Louisiana Academy of Science, showed that of 12,400 encounters between snake and auto over a period of three years, 1,281, or 10.3%, ended in death for the snake.

Physicians treating a snake venom researcher, whose need for rare medicine prompted White House intervention, were awaiting a shipment of serum from Iran today to counteract a deadly viper bite. In an unusual effort initiated by Stephen Studdert, special assistant to President Bush, antivenins effective against the bite of a Pakistani pit viper were located in Iran, England and the Soviet Union, and U.S. Customs rules were waived to place the shipments quickly on flights to the United States. The antivenins were sought for William E. Haast, 78, who was in serious but stable condition at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center today after being bitten in the left hand by the viper earlier in the week.

Haast, director of the Miami Serpentarium Laboratories at the university's Research Park, has been bitten 148 times by snakes and is immune to the venom of dozens of reptiles. But he had no immunity to withstand the viper's bite and checked himself into the hospital Wednesday after being bitten Tuesday. The Pakistani pit viper, or saw scaled viper, is one of 1,000 exotic, poisonous snakes Haast keeps at the lab, where their venom is extracted for sale to universities and health organizations for use in research and the manufacture of antivenins.

St. Patrick may have chased the snakes from Ireland, but unlike the winner of an upcoming contest here, he didn't get a pickup truck for the accomplishment. That's what this Pacific island is offering to the person who can collect the most brown tree snakes in a one month period starting June 23. The first annual Sweep Snakes contest is part of an effort to rid the U.S. territory of the more than 2 million brown tree snakes that have infested the 212 square mile island.

Hundreds of video rental shops on Friday received promotional kits for a horror movie with live snakes inside the packages, and outraged animal protection officials called the stunt cruel and irresponsible. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals called on Cinema International Corp. to take back the 700 reptiles. The snakes were in danger because instructions accompanying the kits had incorrectly said they did not need to be fed for their planned month long stay in the stores, the society said.

Operators of a rattlesnake rodeo, rattled by criticism that they could be driving the Eastern diamondback to extinction, returned their catch to the wild Sunday. Because the 150 snakes were freed at the end of the two day event, no rattlesnake meat was on sale at Opp's 30th Rattlesnake Rodeo for the thousands of people who attended. The meat had been one of the better drawing cards over the years.

So it was with great interest that I turned to two new books describing the complex relationships we, well, some of us, forge with nonhumans: Thomas Palmer's Landscape With Reptile: Rattlesnakes in the Urban World (Ticknor &amp; Fields, 340 pages, $19.95) and Stephen Budiansky's The Covenant of the Wild: Why Animals Chose Domestication (Morrow, 190 pages, $18). Mr. Budiansky, a science writer who owns a small farm in Maryland, suggests that many animals actually prefer to live with people who eat them and buy them tartan lined sleeping baskets from L.L.
