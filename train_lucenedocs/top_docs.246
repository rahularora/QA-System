Spain's plans to stage a headline grabbing 500th birthday party for America in 1992 have stirred up a storm of controversy over how Portugal is celebrating its own discoverers, who were charting the Atlantic before Christopher Columbus was born. Spain and Portugal were archrivals in the push in the 15th and 16th centuries to sail off the end of known maps and find new worlds. Both succeeded.

Portugal has every right to be proud of its illustrious past, and the manner in which it recalls events in its history that the rest of the world ignores is nothing short of endearing. Few outside Portugal, for example, are aware that 1991 was the 500th anniversary of the first Portuguese mission to the kingdom of the Congo, or that 2000 will mark the the 500th anniversary of the colonisation of Brazil, or that this year celebrates the 600th anniversary of the birth of Prince Henry the Navigator whose intellectual stimulus and deep pockets made such milestones possible. The world outside Portugal may, however, become aware of the significance of 1998 as the year marking 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's voyage to India.

The Portuguese, with self deprecating humour, like to describe Lisbon as a city of the developing world, rather than a European capital. The country's historical involvement with Africa, Asia and the Arab world is evident in the city's architecture, culture and cuisine but on a technical level, it functions almost on a par with the most modern of its European counterparts. Doing business in Lisbon is rarely arduous and the hospitality of the Portuguese usually makes it a pleasure.

Botafogo's victory Sunday sealed the matter, so far as its players and fans were concerned. But the rules were changed during this season's recess for the World Cup, when the Soccer Federation decided that the winner would be determined by a point system. Under that system, Botafogo and Vasco were tied with one victory apiece at the end of regulation time in Sunday's game and should have played an overtime period to determine the overall winner.

A ruling is expected within 20 days, but soccer fans may have to be patient: The last time there was a dispute over the title was in 1907, and the final decision on that didn't come until 1989.

Often fascinating are new and reprinted accounts of people's travels. Bruce Chatwin, in Songlines, seeks out the traditional ancestral paths of aborigines in the Australian Outback, and Mary Morris travels alone and offbeat in Mexico in Nothing to Declare (both Viking Penguin). Freya Stark visits Turkish spots that Alexander the Great visited in the years before the Christian era and thinks of his experiences as she jolts and rides along Alexander's Path (Overlook Press).

Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN <F P=106> [Interview with Admiral Fuzeta da Ponte, Armed Forces chief </F> of staff, by Jose Manuel Saraiva; place and date not given] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Saraiva] The EMGFA [Armed Forces General Staff] is a very bureaucratic structure. What will you do to make this body effective, open, and perhaps more modern? [Fuzeta] In the first place, I will have to concern myself with a rigorous assessment of the degrees of readiness and maintenance of the Armed Forces.

What will you do to make this body effective, open, and perhaps more modern? [Fuzeta] In the first place, I will have to concern myself with a rigorous assessment of the degrees of readiness and maintenance of the Armed Forces. Over the past few years we have witnessed profound changes in the Armed Forces, ranging from the initiation of new laws governing the body to the new personnel recruitment and pay systems, with a view to the greater effectiveness of the Armed Forces.

The changes in the EMGFA form part of a broader plan that I wish to implement and whose aim is to assess the final outcome of those changes. [Saraiva] Do you believe that the material and human resources of the Armed Forces are sufficient to implement that plan?
 FBIS3-19869 
The changes in the EMGFA form part of a broader plan that I wish to implement and whose aim is to assess the final outcome of those changes. [Saraiva] Do you believe that the material and human resources of the Armed Forces are sufficient to implement that plan? [Fuzeta] No military chief anywhere in the world deems the available resources sufficient.
 FBIS3-19869 
[Saraiva] Do you believe that the material and human resources of the Armed Forces are sufficient to implement that plan? [Fuzeta] No military chief anywhere in the world deems the available resources sufficient. In the first place, the needs are always very great.
 FBIS3-19869 
[Fuzeta] No military chief anywhere in the world deems the available resources sufficient. In the first place, the needs are always very great. We must acknowledge that a great deal has been done in Portugal to improve the Armed Forces.
 FBIS3-19869 
In the first place, the needs are always very great. We must acknowledge that a great deal has been done in Portugal to improve the Armed Forces. This is a fact that must be acknowledged, but we must also remember that the recovery of the Armed Forces started from a very low point.... [Saraiva] What do you mean by that?
 FBIS3-19869 
We must acknowledge that a great deal has been done in Portugal to improve the Armed Forces. This is a fact that must be acknowledged, but we must also remember that the recovery of the Armed Forces started from a very low point.... [Saraiva] What do you mean by that? [Fuzeta] I mean that our Armed Forces were already obsolete.
 FBIS3-19869 
This is a fact that must be acknowledged, but we must also remember that the recovery of the Armed Forces started from a very low point.... [Saraiva] What do you mean by that? [Fuzeta] I mean that our Armed Forces were already obsolete. Their modernization depends on the level of investment, which means that the greater the resources allocated to the Armed Forces, the more rapidly they will be able to achieve their aims.
 FBIS3-19869 
[Fuzeta] I mean that our Armed Forces were already obsolete. Their modernization depends on the level of investment, which means that the greater the resources allocated to the Armed Forces, the more rapidly they will be able to achieve their aims. We are never satisfied.
 FBIS3-19869 
Their modernization depends on the level of investment, which means that the greater the resources allocated to the Armed Forces, the more rapidly they will be able to achieve their aims. We are never satisfied. [Saraiva] How do you explain young people's enormous lack of motivation to serve the Armed Forces?
 FBIS3-19869 
We are never satisfied. [Saraiva] How do you explain young people's enormous lack of motivation to serve the Armed Forces? [Fuzeta] This is a very serious matter.
 FBIS3-19869 
[Saraiva] How do you explain young people's enormous lack of motivation to serve the Armed Forces? [Fuzeta] This is a very serious matter. Over the years, the Portuguese people have always known how to defend the fatherland.
 FBIS3-19869 
[Fuzeta] This is a very serious matter. Over the years, the Portuguese people have always known how to defend the fatherland. They have always found considerable motivation to that end.
 FBIS3-19869 
Over the years, the Portuguese people have always known how to defend the fatherland. They have always found considerable motivation to that end. Hence the motivation to serve the Armed Forces depends to some extent on the perception of the threats surrounding society at a given time.
 FBIS3-19869 
They have always found considerable motivation to that end. Hence the motivation to serve the Armed Forces depends to some extent on the perception of the threats surrounding society at a given time. An individual immersed in a society over which looms a threat of disruption of peace is more motivated to serve the country than in the contrary situation.
 FBIS3-19869 
Hence the motivation to serve the Armed Forces depends to some extent on the perception of the threats surrounding society at a given time. An individual immersed in a society over which looms a threat of disruption of peace is more motivated to serve the country than in the contrary situation. Moreover, it is important that it be said that something has been done to improve the motivation of the personnel serving in the Armed Forces.

An individual immersed in a society over which looms a threat of disruption of peace is more motivated to serve the country than in the contrary situation. Moreover, it is important that it be said that something has been done to improve the motivation of the personnel serving in the Armed Forces. For instance, for career professionals the modernization of the new resources is a highly motivating factor.

Moreover, it is important that it be said that something has been done to improve the motivation of the personnel serving in the Armed Forces. For instance, for career professionals the modernization of the new resources is a highly motivating factor. Any Army professional likes to have his M 60's, any Air Force man eagerly awaits the F 16's; naturally, any sailor is pleased with the Vasco da Gama class frigates.

With respect to the contract and volunteer personnel, in addition to these aspects we are also motivating them through accelerated vocational training, so that, after serving in the ranks, they will be reintegrated into civilian life.

With respect to the contract and volunteer personnel, in addition to these aspects we are also motivating them through accelerated vocational training, so that, after serving in the ranks, they will be reintegrated into civilian life. However, it is in education that the values that lead the Portuguese people to love their fatherland are instilled, and it is imparted in the schools and at home.

However, it is in education that the values that lead the Portuguese people to love their fatherland are instilled, and it is imparted in the schools and at home. [Saraiva] With respect to the so called performance of military duties, which system do you prefer compulsory military service or the volunteer and contract system?

[Saraiva] With respect to the so called performance of military duties, which system do you prefer compulsory military service or the volunteer and contract system? [Fuzeta] The matter is eminently political.
 FBIS3-19869 
[Saraiva] With respect to the so called performance of military duties, which system do you prefer compulsory military service or the volunteer and contract system? [Fuzeta] The matter is eminently political. This is an important debate that should be conducted in the proper forum.
 FBIS3-19869 
[Fuzeta] The matter is eminently political. This is an important debate that should be conducted in the proper forum. Technically, there are Armed Forces that have opted for the volunteer system for instance, Britain and others that have chosen the compulsory system, such as France, and have not lost effectiveness on that account.
 FBIS3-19869 
This is an important debate that should be conducted in the proper forum. Technically, there are Armed Forces that have opted for the volunteer system for instance, Britain and others that have chosen the compulsory system, such as France, and have not lost effectiveness on that account. I mean by this that it is possible to have effective Armed Forces both with the volunteer system and with the conscript system.

Technically, there are Armed Forces that have opted for the volunteer system for instance, Britain and others that have chosen the compulsory system, such as France, and have not lost effectiveness on that account. I mean by this that it is possible to have effective Armed Forces both with the volunteer system and with the conscript system. In any event, no system is pure.
 FBIS3-19869 
I mean by this that it is possible to have effective Armed Forces both with the volunteer system and with the conscript system. In any event, no system is pure. All are hybrids.
 FBIS3-19869 
In any event, no system is pure. All are hybrids. Right now, we have a roster of volunteers, but in the event of a crisis or war, we would still have to resort to general mobilization.
 FBIS3-19869 
All are hybrids. Right now, we have a roster of volunteers, but in the event of a crisis or war, we would still have to resort to general mobilization. [Saraiva] You referred to vocational training aimed at the contractees and volunteers.
 FBIS3-19869 
Right now, we have a roster of volunteers, but in the event of a crisis or war, we would still have to resort to general mobilization. [Saraiva] You referred to vocational training aimed at the contractees and volunteers. Does the setting up of these institutes have any parallel in the armed forces of other countries?
 FBIS3-19869 
[Saraiva] You referred to vocational training aimed at the contractees and volunteers. Does the setting up of these institutes have any parallel in the armed forces of other countries? [Fuzeta] There are similar measures in several European countries specifically, in France.
 FBIS3-19869 
Does the setting up of these institutes have any parallel in the armed forces of other countries? [Fuzeta] There are similar measures in several European countries specifically, in France. [Saraiva] But in Portugal this is a recent innovation whose sole aim seems to be to attract less qualified young people to join up.
 FBIS3-19869 
[Fuzeta] There are similar measures in several European countries specifically, in France. [Saraiva] But in Portugal this is a recent innovation whose sole aim seems to be to attract less qualified young people to join up. [Fuzeta] This is in the tradition of the great services to the nation performed by the Armed Forces.

[Fuzeta] This is in the tradition of the great services to the nation performed by the Armed Forces. For many years, compulsory military service to some extent compensated for the basic education that was not given in the schools.

[Fuzeta] This is in the tradition of the great services to the nation performed by the Armed Forces. For many years, compulsory military service to some extent compensated for the basic education that was not given in the schools. It is well known that many young people from the poorest families who came from the most disadvantaged regions found a basic education in the forces, but now that tradition in the Armed Forces is exercised in a more sophisticated way.

It is well known that many young people from the poorest families who came from the most disadvantaged regions found a basic education in the forces, but now that tradition in the Armed Forces is exercised in a more sophisticated way. [Saraiva] But there are those actually within the Armed Forces who say that the fighting military component could be disadvantaged for the benefit of a vocational training for which the forces are not, at first sight, designed?

[Saraiva] But there are those actually within the Armed Forces who say that the fighting military component could be disadvantaged for the benefit of a vocational training for which the forces are not, at first sight, designed? [Fuzeta] On the contrary. We can only have fighting forces in Portugal if they are very well trained.
 FBIS3-19869 
[Fuzeta] On the contrary. We can only have fighting forces in Portugal if they are very well trained. We must have small, but good forces.
 FBIS3-19869 
We can only have fighting forces in Portugal if they are very well trained. We must have small, but good forces. There can be no good fighter without good training.
 FBIS3-19869 
We must have small, but good forces. There can be no good fighter without good training. So the vocational training process helps modernize the Armed Forces, and if that training can be projected outside, so as to benefit those whom have performed military service, I can see no harm in our civilianizing the training that we currently give young people.

[Saraiva] What role should the Armed Forces have in the prevailing international situation? [Fuzeta] It is, of course, different from what it was five years ago, owing to the reduction in intensity of the East West conflict.

[Saraiva] What role should the Armed Forces have in the prevailing international situation? [Fuzeta] It is, of course, different from what it was five years ago, owing to the reduction in intensity of the East West conflict. At that time, there was still a large number of forces settled on various fronts and with little flexibility.

[Fuzeta] It is, of course, different from what it was five years ago, owing to the reduction in intensity of the East West conflict. At that time, there was still a large number of forces settled on various fronts and with little flexibility. Today, the scene is completely different.
 FBIS3-19869 
At that time, there was still a large number of forces settled on various fronts and with little flexibility. Today, the scene is completely different. In the current multipolar system we are witnessing several regional conflicts that require limited but well trained and more flexible Armed Forces.
 FBIS3-19869 
Today, the scene is completely different. In the current multipolar system we are witnessing several regional conflicts that require limited but well trained and more flexible Armed Forces. In Portugal we must transform the Armed Forces, precisely so that we can use them strictly in Portugal's interest on the international scene.

In Portugal we must transform the Armed Forces, precisely so that we can use them strictly in Portugal's interest on the international scene. [Saraiva] Do you believe that Portugal should participate more in international crises?
 FBIS3-19869 
In Portugal we must transform the Armed Forces, precisely so that we can use them strictly in Portugal's interest on the international scene. [Saraiva] Do you believe that Portugal should participate more in international crises? For instance, during the Gulf war, some military men argued that the Portuguese Armed Forces should have taken part more actively in the conflict.

[Saraiva] Do you believe that Portugal should participate more in international crises? For instance, during the Gulf war, some military men argued that the Portuguese Armed Forces should have taken part more actively in the conflict. [Fuzeta] That is a political matter.

For instance, during the Gulf war, some military men argued that the Portuguese Armed Forces should have taken part more actively in the conflict. [Fuzeta] That is a political matter. It is the political power that decides on involvement of the Armed Forces.
 FBIS3-19869 
[Fuzeta] That is a political matter. It is the political power that decides on involvement of the Armed Forces. However, I will simply say that Portugal should act in the just defense of its interests.

Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] The old alliance established 600 years ago between Portugal and Great Britain was a political diplomatic agreement against the Spaniards, writes Jose Vegar in the 5 March Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO. Noting that things are not much different today, it is still in Lisbon's strategic interest to align itself with the United Kingdom in the field of European construction, he contends. Vegar cites Carlos Gaspar, adviser to President Mario Soares, as saying that it is necessary to choose the lesser of two evils, between those who wish to preserve Portugal's transatlantic vocation and the European Union (EU) and those who opt for subregional integrations that obviate the existence of the Community.

In Gaspar's opinion, Portugal profits from aligning itself with Great Britain within the framework of the EU, for this reinforces the tripartite center (France, Germany, United Kingdom)...so enlargement will not negatively affect it.

Finally, Gama is cited as claiming that the old theory of Atlantic versus continental nations cannot justify Portugal's interest in favoring a close relationship with Great Britain, for the world is presently regulated by multipolarity, and a specific response to each problem is needed.

A strong man could have rowed around the world more than once in the time it took Giacomo Meyerbeer to finish his opera about the explorer Vasco da Gama. Finally, in 1864, after 25 years and who knows how many revisions, he thought he was just about done with L'Africaine. And before he could change his mind again and add another country, a few more trills and two more ballets to his 4 1/2 hour extravaganza featuring four soloists and three elephants, death took the well worn quill out of the hand of Europe's most applauded composer.

Sublime Muse, chanted a somber chorus to a mournful accompaniment of taps and drum rolls at Meyerbeer's funeral. This chant funebre was written by another neurotic, Gioachino Rossini, whose indolence was as legendary as Meyerbeer's. After a prolific youth, Rossini wrote no operas during the last 39 years of his life, partly to avoid competing with Meyerbeer, though he had more talent in his fat fingers than ever coursed through the German's sickly body.

And if both Mozambique and Angola manage to secure a lasting peace in the critical days ahead, it would mark a watershed for the region, led today by newly democratic South Africa.

BFN <F P=106> [By Harald Bruning in Macao] </F> [Text] Portugal's new state secret law , approved by the parliament in Lisbon in February, was gazetted in Macao yesterday. Macao's Governor, General Vasco Rocha Vieira, was reported to have insisted that the Portuguese law be enforced in Macao. According to the law, documents and pieces of information whose knowledge by non authorised persons is susceptible to putting at risk or causing harm to the national independence, unity and integrity of the (Portuguese) State and its internal and external security fall under the state secret category.

Sleeping dogs, dead rats and discarded syringes lie along the dirt paths leading into a forlorn neighbourhood of shanty dwellings and slum houses, sprawling across a Lisbon hillside in the shadow of a multi storey shopping centre, Peter Wise reports from Lisbon. Young men question outsiders before admitting them to the rows of crumbling houses and dilapidated shacks made of planks, plastic sheeting and corrugated iron. The only visitors they expect are the police or drug takers looking for supplies.

At the window of a dilapidated hotel I watched dawn break over Mozambique island, where Vasco da Gama's ships cast anchor in 1498.

PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM; The trial of Deputy DA Julius Finkelstein's lawsuit against ex DA Louis Bergna in San Francisco has produced one fascinating footnote. You may remember that Finkelstein is claiming that he was illegally suspended by Bergna during the 1982 district attorney's race. In an attempt to discredit Finkelstein, Bergna's attorney, Craig Brown, has pointed out that Finkelstein once secretly recorded a conversation between himself and then San Jose Police Chief Joe McNamara.

BFN <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Alberto Sardenberg] </F> [Text] The economic team believes that it is losing control of the Real Plan. After President Itamar Franco trampled on it in the chapters on rents, school fees, and the antitrust law, the economic team now finds itself facing a greater threat: the regulation of banking interest rates. President Franco has asked Deputy Benito Gama (PFL BA) [Liberal Front Party Bahia] to hasten the presentation of the draft bill regulating Article 192, Paragraph 3, of the Constitution, which establishes that real interest rates (not including the inflation rate) cannot surpass 12 percent annually.

For someone not living inside the brain of Bruce Crawford, the Metropolitan Opera remains as mysterious as darkest outer space. I say this now that Mr. Crawford's second season as general manager has ended and the traditional annual rite of hand wringing is upon us. It isn't easy to fathom a season that ranged from a spavined new production of Verdi's Il Trovatore to a poetic revival of Puccini's La Boheme.

THE UNION BUG; Just as the Daily News strike in New York City carries disproportionate weight for the future of New York labor, the current AFL CIO boycott of the De Anza Hotel in San Jose matters more to local labor than the number of De Anza workers some 40 would suggest. In Silicon Valley, where the vast majority of high tech workers are non unionized, labor finds its leverage through politicians. When the Fairmont Hotel opened more than three years ago, Mayor Tom McEnery was able to avert picketing at his downtown showpiece only by persuading Mel and Richard Swig to sign a so called neutrality agreement.

Mandela's wife, Winnie, their daughter, Zinzi, and their three grandchildren planned an 80 minute visit Sunday with Mandela at his suburban style house on the grounds of the Victor Vester Prison.

THERE IS nothing like a gnome to cheer you up in a recession. Forget the Private Eye advertisments and the decades of being shunned by polite society: the little fellows are working overtime to keep us happy during these difficult days. At least that is the view of Tessa and John Newman, who for the last four years have concentrated exclusively on selling garden gnomes.
