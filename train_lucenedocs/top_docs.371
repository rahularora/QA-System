Flanked by the queen and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Bush sat down to a meal of smoked salmon mousse, duck with honey and brandy sauce, broad beans, asparagus and potatoes, artichoke salad and mango ice cream. The three wines included two which the queen served Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife Raisa when they lunched together at Windsor Castle in April. They are an Alsatian white Gewurztraminer Dopff 1983 and the queen's private port, Royal Vintage 1955.

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s computer business and its Unix operating system got a big boost Friday when the company won an estimated $929 million Air Force contract. The award provides AT&amp;T with much needed credibility in the computer industry, analysts said, and is likely to be used by the telephone giant as a major marketing tool. AT&amp;T executives said the contract with options runs for eight years and could be worth more than $4.5 billion if the Defense Department and civilian agencies order their authorized limits for equipment, software and services.

Fresh from the splendors of the Kremlin, President Reagan and his wife Nancy went to Buckingham Palace for tea with the queen Thursday and smiled aside all invitations to compare the virtues of East and West.

Or, more recently, the drawn out saga of Princess Margaret, the queen's younger sister, whose marriage to Lord Snowdon ended in divorce in 1978.
