Truly, 50, became a NASA astronaut in 1969 and has been the agency's associate administrator for space flight since 1986. He piloted the shuttle Columbia on NASA's second space shuttle flight and was commander of the eighth flight in 1983.

The two reusable booster rockets that helped Atlantis soar into space were on their way back to port today from the spot where they splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean 50 miles offshore. Two ships were to start towing them this morning and they were expected to reach port by evening, said Rocky Raab, a spokesman for Morton Thiokol Inc., which makes the rockets. The rockets were redesigned after the failure of a booster rocket part caused the explosion of Challenger in January 1986 and the deaths of seven astronauts.

An expedition headed by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan needed three years to sail around the world in the 16th century. That's more than twice the time it should take the robot spacecraft Magellan to travel 806 million miles to Venus. Magellan, who chose to sail under the Spanish flag, commanded a five ship flotilla that left Seville, Spain, on Sept. 20, 1519, to search for a route to the so called Spice Islands in the south Pacific.

Reports Friday said the Buran can carry as many as 10 people four cosmonauts and six passengers and placed its cost of Energiya and Buran at about that of the U.S. shuttle, some $10 billion.

Energiya, which can lift a payload of more than 100 tons, has been used only once before. On a test flight in May 1987, its payload failed to reach orbit, but Soviet officials said the problem was with the guidance system of the satellite rather than with the gigantic booster.

<P> A Cree Indian has completed a 2,700 mile run from Edmonton, Canada, to New York City to lay claim to a sacred relic stored in the American Museum of Natural History. Carrying a curved staff draped with eagle feathers for strength and wearing a wolf pelt for protection, Jim Thunder said he was driven by a recurring dream in which Chief Big Bear of the Crees instructed him to retrieve the artifact a parcel of calico holding bear claws, a clump of sweet grass and a plug of tobacco. Big Bear, leader of the Plains Cree, made the sacred bundle about 150 years ago when he was about 13 years old and wore it into battle for strength and guidance.

Magellan, America's first interplanetary probe in 11 years, is named for a Portuguese explorer who 467 years ago led the expedition that was the first to sail around the world. After it is deployed in orbit by the space shuttle, the Magellan probe will travel to Venus in 15 months. The 800 million mile voyage will last less than half as long as it took a 16th century expedition led by Ferdinand Magellan to sail around the world.

The sudden halt was similar to the dramatic last minute postponement of the liftoff of the world's first shuttle. The U.S. craft Columbia was delayed for two days in April 1981 because of computer software problems.

Jerry Smelser, head of the engine program at the Marshall center, said NASA needs to determine if the problem involves parts similar to those in Columbia's engines.

A practice space shuttle countdown was under way here today in a test leading to a firing of Discovery's three main engines on the launch pad Saturday. The launch team started the count at 11:33 p.m. Sunday. On Wednesday, it planned to load more than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant into the shuttle's external fuel tank.

Soviet space scientists declared a brilliant success the unmanned maiden voyage of the space shuttle Buran, and are planning a much longer second mission, Tass said Tuesday. The previous program was brilliantly performed; when the craft came to a halt on the runway its time deviation from the program reached only one second, while the deviation of the Buran's axis from that of the runway was only 1.5 meters, the official news agency reported. Only five of the 39,000 heat protecting tiles broke away during the 3 hour, 20 minute flight Nov. 15 and the spacecraft, whose name means Snowstorm in Russian, successfully maneuvered in bad weather, Tass said.

NASA said today it will not try to launch space shuttle Atlantis and the robot probe targeted for Venus until a fuel pump problem and leaking fuel line are corrected on the space shuttle and we don't know when we can go. Sources close to the program reported earlier that the postponement could be at least 10 days, but later said that was based on a preliminary assessment. They said the delay will be several days and possibly could stretch to a week or more if technicians have to replace both the pump and the fuel line.

A new countdown begins tonight for a 22 second firing of space shuttle Discovery's three main engines, a vital test that has been postponed five times because of malfunctions. If this test succeeds, NASA officials will set a date for the first American manned space flight since the Challenger burst into flames on liftoff in January 1986. The Discovery launch date, already officially moved four times, is not likely to be before October because of all the test delays.

A practice space shuttle countdown hit a snag Monday, delaying a critical test firing of Discovery's three main engines 24 hours, until Sunday. The postponement was announced as engineers assessed methods for fixing a small shuttle gas leak without having to take Discovery off the launch pad, a move that could delay the planned early September launch by as much as two months. The launch team started the countdown late Sunday and fell behind early in closing out the shuttle's rear engine compartment on the pad.

That forced a one day delay in the loading of gases aboard the spaceship's energy producing fuel cells. The plan now calls for crews to pump more than half a million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into Discovery's external fuel tank late Wednesday and early Thursday. It will mark the first time a shuttle has been fueled since the fleet was grounded by the Challenger explosion Jan. 28, 1986.

Space shuttle Atlantis is carrying two space newcomers, part of a new generation of astronauts with a look and background unlike that of the all white, crew cut, All American team who rode the Mercury capsules. Nine more rookies have been named to four future flights, and a new class of astronauts is in training to fill spots vacated by veterans who took other jobs after the shuttle Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986. The space program now has 93 men and women astronauts, with a nearly even mix of experienced space travelers and those who have never flown into space.

The crew of space shuttle Atlantis successfully deployed a powerful radar satellite over the weekend, reportedly the chief goal of the clandestine military mission, knowledgeable sources said today. The $500 million Lacrosse satellite reportedly was designed to gather extremely sharp all weather images of Eastern Bloc military targets and would help American intelligence agencies monitor Soviet compliance with arms control treaties. The sources, who requested anonymity, said the satellite was operating well as it followed a course that carries it over 80 percent of the Soviet Union.

NASA rolled out a full scale model of its next generation space shuttle for public viewing Tuesday, with hopes it will impress those holding the purse strings for the nation's space program. The 115 foot mockup of the planned Shuttle C, an unmanned, cargo carrying space shuttle, was put together in a hanger at Marshall Space Flight Center for about $500,000. The model will be shown to visiting congressman and other VIPs, and is expected to become part of bus tours through Marshall operated by the Alabama Space and Rocket Center.

NASA rejected a bidder on the Hubble Space Telescope that planned tests to detect focusing flaws and instead picked a company that proposed no such tests and made mirrors with a fuzzy view of the universe, a space agency official says. Eastman Kodak Co., in its effort to win the contract to build the Hubble mirrors, proposed a final assembly testing of the telescope optics, NASA Deputy Administrator James R. Thompson told a Senate panel Tuesday.

Eastman Kodak Co., in its effort to win the contract to build the Hubble mirrors, proposed a final assembly testing of the telescope optics, NASA Deputy Administrator James R. Thompson told a Senate panel Tuesday. NASA, however, gave the contract to Perkin Elmer Corp., now Hughes Danbury Optical Systems Inc., which did not plan the fully assembled tests, and the agency chose not to order the tests because they were so expensive, Thompson said. The Hubble Telescope, now in orbit, is disabled because of a focusing flaw that might have been found by tests proposed in the Kodak bid.

<P> President Bush had lots of company as he saluted the nation's space effort. We are gathered here today to celebrate the continuity of our space program and really of our country itself, of America herself, Bush said as he shared a White House stage with five shuttle astronauts, nine fifth graders and nine junior and senior high school students. The astronauts were David M. Walker, Ronald J. Grabe, Norman E. Thagard, Mark C. Lee and Mary L. Cleave, who returned May 8 from a four day mission aboard the shuttle Atlantis.

Engineers have fixed a leak discovered in a hydrogen fuel line on space shuttle Discovery, which is being prepared for a late February launch. NASA said the leak, detected Thursday, was caused by a fuel line misalignment that was quickly corrected once the source was known. It was in a 2 inch line in a section that connects the shuttle to its external fuel tank.
