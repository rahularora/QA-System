A 51 year old elephant at the San Diego Zoo had to be killed because of injuries she suffered after falling headfirst into a concrete moat, officials said.

</P> <P> Historians and archeologists have long pondered the reasons for this downfall, arguing at different times that losses of trade routes, changes in climate, endemic disease and many other related factors contributed to their downfall. In the past, most of the theories shared the premise that the Mayas were largely a peace loving people who engaged in limited warfare only for ritualistic purposes and who met their demise through little fault of their own. </P> <P> But new discoveries made this summer in the lowlands of Guatemala by a team headed by Demarest present a sharply different picture of the end of the Maya era.

The Belgian link is poignantly presented, less in the person of Empress Charlotte who, I learnt, was an insanely ambitious woman who forced poor Maximilian to accept the throne, than in the story of the Belgian volunteers who left from Oudenaarde to defend their princess. Ghent has a superb exhibition of silver, mostly religious, from New Spain in the fine new galleries of the Museum vor Sierkunst; and shows elsewhere explore popular art through masks, Day of the Dead paraphernalia, and the muralists.

Deep in a mangrove swamp near the Gulf of Mexico, archaeologists have discovered traces of what could be another ancient Mexican civilization. So far, the only clues to these mysterious people are a four ton stele, or stone slab, covered with hieroglyphic writing and a 19 inch high clay figure of a fertility rite priest. But, says Fernando Winfield Capitaine, director of the Xalapa Museum of Anthropology, the finds are so promising that the museum is planning to mount an expedition to that area of Veracruz state in cooperation with the National Geographic Society.

The priest in the clay figure is wearing the human skin of a flayed sacrificial victim. Both are about 1,800 years old. That would place them in the second century A.D., which is after the archaeological Olmecs, who flourished in the area from around 1050 to 500 B.C., and before the Mayas who emerged around the fourth century A.D, Winfield said in an interview.

The Aztecs called it in Xipe Totec, or the Lord of the Flayed, and it was variously worshiped as the god of spring, of fertility, of abundance and of the metalworkers. A peasant at La Mojarra found the shattered figure many years ago while digging the foundations for his house and kept the pieces in a cardboard box. We got wind of it three weeks ago, and we convinced him to let the museum have it, Winfield said.

Mexico announced Friday it is reducing crude oil exports by 5 percent beginning April 1 in a coordinated move with other producers in an effort to buttress prices on the world market. Crude exports will be cut by an average of 68,600 barrels a day from the current average of 1.37 million, the Department of Energy and Mines said in a statement. With this, Mexico fully acknowledges that strengthening the oil market is a joint responsibility by producers and consumers, since everyone benefits from a stable market and (fair) prices, it said.

THE quincentenary of Columbus's landfall in America has been the source of considerable soul searching in the US. While mainstream Mr and Ms America may be happy to celebrate Europe's Transatlantic leap, the original new worlders (not to mention the watchdogs of political correctness) are demanding apologies and penance for the devastation which the 'white gods' from the east wrought on the indigeous peoples they encountered. There is then a timeliness in The Art of Ancient Mexico, a fascinating and worthy celebration of the arts of the Olmecs, Mayas, Aztecs and other cultures which dominated Mesoamerica for some 3,000 years before the arrival of the Spanish.

Midnight street theater, Cuban jazz, flamenco dance, roving street clowns and mimes: It's all part of the International Cervantes Festival, a two week celebration staged each fall in this charming colonial city. The 16th annual edition of Mexico's cultural event features about 150 dance, theater and music repertory groups from 57 countries and Mexico. It also draws countless unofficial folk bands, clowns and mimes to the twisting cobblestoned streets and hidden alleys of Guanajuato, a 16th century silver mining town about 225 miles northwest of Mexico City.

Further details on this by reporter Leonel Perez Moya: [Begin Perez recording] Using its own resources, at a cost of 690,000 pesos, the revamped plant operates by gravity and replaces the old, inefficient installation that has been corroded by inclement weather. The approximate five km of conduits and pipes of various diameters, leading to the main duct, replaces the pumping system, with an annual savings of 590 megawatts of electricity.

The scene is from a workshop presentation of an excerpt from Popol Vuh, a commissioned opera in progress, which could become the most ambitious project attempted by Opera San Jose. ; With a score by prize winning electronic composer Allen Strange, a libretto by Robert Jenkins and choreography by David A. Vargas, the 16 minute excerpt staged recently at San Jose State was as visually stunning and exotic as anything in Aida or L'Africaine. ; This operatic pie slice is decidedly unorthodox, using computer generated music throughout and no acoustic instruments.

The team has detected 26 raptor species in the two Central American nations. Working with peregrines not only gave the group a scientific background that can be applied to other raptors, but it also helped them develop skills needed to work with other people, Burnham said. Cooperation is the key word.

Mexico does not belong to OPEC but closely follows the 13 member organization's pricing and production guidelines.

Maya Gold chocolate made from Peck's beans went on sale in 80 supermarkets in the UK last week as the first product to carry a seal of approval from Fairtrade, an organisation which is trying to ensure workers in the Third World get a better deal.

In July, the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals (RSPCA) plans to issue its own label Freedom Food for meat and eggs which have been produced, transported and slaughtered in a humane way. Both organisations hope to capitalise on the conscience of the 1990s consumer who fills his supermarket trolley with environmentally friendly washing powder and recycled toilet paper. A poll by NOP for Christian Aid conducted in October last year found that 68 per cent of the 1,000 adults surveyed said they would be willing to pay more for products that guaranteed a fair return to farmers and workers in the Third World.

When We Dead Awaken was Henrik Ibsen's final play, written in 1899 when the Norwegian playwright was 72 years old. It is the story of Rubek (Alvin Epstein), a famous sculptor in his final years, living in a sterile marriage with his lusty young wife, Maya (Stephanie Roth). During the play, Irene (played by two actresses, Elzbieta Czyzewska and Sheryl Sutton) shows upyears before she had been the model for Rubek's masterpiece.

<P> Investigators at the Humane Society of the United States sent a letter Wednesday to the San Diego Zoo charging that its elephant exhibit is inadequate and extremely dangerous for both the huge mammals and their keepers. </P> <P> The letter to Doug Meyers, director of the San Diego Zoological Society, was prompted by the death Sunday of Maya, a 51 year old Asian elephant that was put to death after she fell into a moat and crippled herself. </P> <P> We do not question the care Maya received after her tragic fall into the moat, nor the fact that euthanasia was the humane decision to make on her behalf, wrote David K. Wills, a vice president in the Humane Society's Department of Investigations.
