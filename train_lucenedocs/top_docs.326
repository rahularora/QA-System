A record number of manatees, 160, died in Florida waters in 1989, and state biologists fear recent cold weather will kill more of the lumbering marine mammals. We're quite worried about the increasing number of deaths, said Bruce Ackerman, a researcher with the Department of Natural Resources in St. Petersburg. Biologists estimate at least 1,200 manatees, an endangered species, live in Florida.

A record 201 manatees died in Florida waters this year, authorities said. At least 46 of the endangered sea cows were found dead in the weeks following a three day freeze last Christmas, and boat collisions killed at least 46 more, said Bruce Ackerman, a marine mammal researcher with the state Department of Natural Resources.

AZERBAIJAN'S Brezhnev era KGB and communist party chief, Mr Heidar Aliyev, made a remarkable political comeback yesterday, winning election as chairman of the former Soviet republic's parliament. The election makes Mr Aliyev, 70, nominally the second most powerful leader to Azerbaijan President Abulfaz Elchibey. But diplomats and other foreign observers in Baku, the capital, believe that the wily Mr Aliyev has carved himself out a significant chunk of Mr Elchibey's power and that new elections are likely.

CSO <F P=106> [Republic of Azerbaijan presidential edict: Measures To </F> Increase Social Protection of the Population and Financial Stabilization of the Economy ] [Text] The increase in inflation and the decline in production have led in recent times to a lowering of the living standard of society and have exerted a negative influence on the financial state of the republic. This has been connected to a decisive extent with the inefficient use of the financial and credit resources of public enterprises and organizations, the unjustified increase in their crossover into nonstate structures, and the absence of precise mechanisms of the pursuit of a price policy and the regulation of wages and the currency market. All this is creating difficulties for the implementation of the program of market transformations and bringing about a growth of socioeconomic tension.

CSO <F P=106> [Article by A. Yusifova: Banks Have Been Audited ] </F> [Text] The Main Administration for Banking Control of the National Bank of Azerbaijan audited 31 commercial and joint stock commercial banks in the first quarter of 1994. The audits revealed the following shortcomings: To this day a large amount of indebtedness on loans remains at many commercial banks; unlawful increases in banks' statutory fund, failure of some joint stock banks to issue stock, absence of registrations by the Ministry of Finance of the republic, violations of the quota of cash holdings, provision of cash services to customers without permission from the National Bank, violations of rules in the process of accepting customer documents, violations of the economic standards of banks, failure to meet compulsory reserve requirements, and deficiencies in opening accounts have occurred. For the most part the absence of letters of guarantee from enterprises which are indebted to the banks, guarantees of security for personal property, and other credit guarantees, as well as the absence of control over the use of the credit issued were the reasons for the violations.

RUSSIA appears to have achieved the main objective of its currency reform: Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank governor, said yesterday the forced exchange of pre 1993 roubles had compelled former Soviet republics still using the Russian currency to opt in or out of the rouble zone. He said republics which had remained members of the rouble zone using roubles issued by the Bank of Russia as their only, or parallel, currency had to decide whether to stay in or move out. The net effect seems to be to have whittled the 'rouble core' down to six.

UKRAINE needs a 'tactical retreat' from the coupon, the republic's faltering quasi currency, and re introduction of the Russian rouble, according to Mr Vadim Hetman, chairman of the Ukraine National Bank. The National Bank of Ukraine is emerging as the strongest proponent of tougher economic policies for the republic, but fears its belt tightening measures will be opposed by Mr Vitold Fokin, the prime minister. The showdown could come in September, when Mr Hetman plans to present a tough stabilisation programme to parliament.
