Lifland, took control of Eastern from Mr. Lorenzo, placing the carrier in the hands of a trustee, Martin Shugrue Jr. That entire episode so demoralized the Texas Air empire that it sought to distance itself from its past, changing its name and severing all ties to Eastern. The body blows from the Eastern affair also led to Mr. Lorenzo's decision to leave the airline business, according to people who know him.

CREDITORS of Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier and one in bankruptcy since late 1990, have filed a suit against Mr Frank Lorenzo, the airline's former chairman and chief executive. The suit, brought by the official creditors' committee, claims Dollars 180m in damages. Mr Lorenzo, known as a pugnacious union buster and wily deal maker, quit as Continental's boss in August 1990, although he remained a director of the airline.

The creditors claim the transaction deprived Continental of an opportunity to sell equity to SAS at a time when the company needed additional equity. In addition, they claim that Messrs. Lorenzo and Snedeker knew, or should have known, that Continental was technically insolvent when it paid them about $20 million to buy out their employment contracts. The creditors are seeking $180 million in compensatory and punitive damages from the two men and Jet Capital Corp., through which they held most of their stake.

It was the first bankruptcy court refugee in the airline business since the dramatic leap in fuel prices caused by the Persian Gulf crisis, and underscored the financial beating taken by all airlines because of a weakening economy, with fewer passengers flying and booking tickets. The move also marked a rapidly deteriorating situation for Continental, once the nation's biggest airline operator, which only a few weeks ago rejected the bankruptcy court option.

Frank Lorenzo is no longer boss at Continental Airlines, but the carrier he shaped is following a road he traveled in the early 1980s when Continental first sought refuge under federal bankruptcy laws. On Monday, Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. filed for protection for a second time, blaming the move on the recent runup in fuel costs and heavy debts accrued in the 1980s. Lorenzo, the 50 year old entrepreneur who came to symbolize a tumultuous decade of airline deregulation, announced in August he was selling off most of his stake in Continental to Scandinavian Airlines System.

</P> <P> Continental, which had $2.6 billion in debt and long term leases on its books as of June 30 not counting Eastern's multibillion dollar debt said it is thinking of selling its foreign routes to help buy its way out of trouble. The problem is that Continental has pledged its foreign routes to the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal agency that insures pensions. The agency got Continental to pledge those assets to guarantee payment of the shortfall in Eastern's pension plan, a gap that the agency puts at $565 million.

SCANDINAVIAN Airlines Systems (SAS) has decided not to participate in any of the bids for Continental Airlines, the US air carrier which has been in bankruptcy since late 1990. SAS has had a co operation agreement with Continental since 1988, under which it feeds around 150,000 passengers a year into Continental's US network. This was cemented by a Dollars 106m investment in Continental, since written off.

SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) yesterday reported a pre tax loss of SKr1.2bn (Dollars 198m) for 1991, the second straight year it has suffered a deficit following its loss of SKr763m in 1990. The loss reflected extraordinary costs associated with a restructuring programme as well as a write off of its involvement in the Inter Continental hotel chain. SAS made a small operating loss of SKr9m before extraordinary costs against a profit of SKr38m in 1990.

While about 100 Eastern strikers chanted anti Lorenzo slogans outside the long delayed Texas Air annual meeting, the chairman of the nation's biggest airline company told shareholders he has no plans to quit the business, won't sell Eastern and likely will have Texas Air assume some of Eastern's financial obligations.

The write downs, which account for more than 80% of the latest quarter loss, reflect efforts by Continental Holdings to put behind it the controversial and debt laden legacy of former chairman Frank Lorenzo, who borrowed huge sums to assemble Continental Holdings then known as Texas Air Corp. from four ailing carriers. Continental Holdings and all its subsidiaries sought Chapter 11 protection in December, squeezed for cash by their huge debt load and high jet fuel prices. Many of these write offs could have been taken in the future, said Hollis L. Harris, the airline's chairman and president.
