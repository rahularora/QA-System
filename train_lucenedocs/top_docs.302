Physicians treating a snake venom researcher received a shipment of serum from Iran to counteract a deadly viper bite Saturday, but a hospital spokesman said doctors may elect not to use it. Antivenin was flown in Saturday afternoon for William E. Haast, 78, who remained in serious but stable condition at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center after being bit on the left hand by a Pakistani pit viper earlier in the week. The doctors are evaluating it, said John Dwan, hospital spokesman.

A snake venom researcher bitten by a deadly viper rested comfortably Sunday while doctors considered whether to treat him with antivenins from Iran, England and the Soviet Union, a hospital spokesman said. William E. Haast, 78, remained in serious but stable condition at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center after being bitten on the left hand Tuesday by a Pakistani pit viper, also known as a saw scaled viper, said hospital spokesman John Dwan. Mr. Haast is resting very comfortably, eating and chatting with friends, Dwan said.

I didn't say that; the Emergency Preparedness and Injury Control Program of the health department did, in its Fatal Injuries in California, 1988 report. ; While white males tend to die of injuries in greater numbers than members of ethnic minorities, the rates of injury related deaths per capita are higher among black and Hispanic populations. Suicide rates are lower, but, the state reports, this is more than offset by their greater risk of death by such causes as homicide, poisonings, pedestrian mishaps and drowning.

More than 1,400 U.S. troops assigned to Operation Desert Shield have been airlifted to Germany for treatment of broken bones, depression, snake bites and other afflictions, military officials say. But the Army is treating fewer GIs than anticipated for a population of 230,000 people, based on health risk assessments for that region of the world, said Barbara Slifer, spokeswoman for the Army's 7th Medical Command in Heidelberg. Forty three soldiers have died in the deployment, mostly in accidents.

Haast and Utah businessman Alan Glanville have organized AIDS experimental treatment and research in Mexico. Both hesitate to discuss the project, saying it is in its infancy and the hospitals and researchers involved require anonymity. Even after his latest brush with death, Haast says there is little chance he will retire.

Snakebite, an example of one of America's most secret, high technology weapons systems, went on display at a U.S. Air Force base here yesterday for the first time. Soon, Soviet inspectors will scrutinize the newly groomed system. Then, Snakebite will be sawed apart, crushed, and torched in the U.S.

Soon, Soviet inspectors will scrutinize the newly groomed system. Then, Snakebite will be sawed apart, crushed, and torched in the U.S. It is all part of the process of removing and destroying an entire class of European based nuclear weapons as called for in the new superpower arms treaty recently ratified by the U.S. Senate and the Supreme Soviet.

The White House, trying to save a Utah snake venom researcher who was bitten by a rare snake, searched remote corners of the globe for serum and then used U.S. government contacts Friday to speed the medicine to his bedside. Two badly needed serums were located in out of the way parts of Iran and the Soviet Union, and with the White House getting the Customs Service to waive normal clearance rules, were en route to Salt Lake City late Friday. William Haast, director of Miami Serpentarium Laboratories at the University of Utah's Research Park, maintains 1,000 exotic, poisonous snakes at the lab, which provides venom to health organizations and others for research and use in manufacturing anti venins.

But he became ill and was in serious condition Friday at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center, awaiting the rare serums that could give him a full recovery. He already has been treated with massive doses of antivenin, including a shipment the Utah hospital obtained through an unusual airport relay involving a California zoo, a helicopter and a Delta Air Lines jetliner. Stephen Studdert, a special assistant to President Bush, said he got a call Thursday night from an associate of Haast.

Three men moved slowly along the lip of the canyon, their shadows falling below them, stretching long and dark across a long meadow carpeted in lush green grass and dotted with crimson Hereford cattle grazing peacefully in the early morning sun. Eyes on the ground, each man peered into the crevices and recesses of the white, porous gypsum boulders and into the inner depths of the scattered scrub brush that sprouts near the break where canyon meets plateau. Anthony Felder, the leader of the three, parted the leaved branches of a stubby wild plum and was the first to find the object of their quest.

But in his script, the prince becomes a cannibal after finding he likes the taste of flesh while sucking venom from a snakebite. Armour's federal court lawsuit alleges that there are 20 substantial similarities between his script outline, a newspaper clipping he sent along with it, and the movie. Buchwald told People magazine in August the movie was based on a story he sold to Paramount titled It's a Crude, Crude World.

Operators of a rattlesnake rodeo, rattled by criticism that they could be driving the Eastern diamondback to extinction, returned their catch to the wild Sunday. Because the 150 snakes were freed at the end of the two day event, no rattlesnake meat was on sale at Opp's 30th Rattlesnake Rodeo for the thousands of people who attended. The meat had been one of the better drawing cards over the years.

Some medical researchers believe that the super potent aspirins, should they emerge from laboratories and clinical studies, will save tens of thousands of lives by preventing blood clots that can lead to heart attacks. Securities analysts say the market for these medicines may reach $1 billion a year by decade's end, making them one of about a dozen novel therapies to arise from basic scientific advances at the heart of biotechnology. Indeed, nowhere is the marriage of new age molecular biology, medicine and venture capital the hallmark of the U.S. biotech industry more apparent than in the quest for a super aspirin.

At Centocor in Malvern, Pa., researchers used the discovery to design an antibody that, given by injection, would seek out the receptor and deactivate it. That product, called CentoRx, is just now entering an advanced human test of its ability to keep reopened arteries from shutting down again. Cor's founders decided to search for a synthetic protein that would be as potent as an antibody, but whose effect would wear off more quickly.

Venom from a deadly African snake, the green mamba, could lead to new drugs to treat brain disorders, the British Association meeting was told. Professor Alan Harvey of Strathclyde University's Institute for Drug Research described his work on dendrotoxin, an extremely potent nerve poison extracted from mamba venom. Dendrotoxin selectively blocks 'potassium channels' that are an essential part of the signalling mechanism in nerve cells.

State officials and the local press have tried to play down the confrontations. But some federal officials in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, are sympathetic, possibly because of embarrassment over a scandal involving timber riches accumulated by politicians who rule Sarawak, the country's biggest but least developed state. The scandal broke because of a bitter feud between the state's chief minister, Taib Mahmud, and his uncle, Abdul Rahman Yakub, a former chief minister and governor.
