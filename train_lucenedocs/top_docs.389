Europe's Ariane 3 rocket lifted off on schedule Friday night for a mission to place French and U.S. communications satellites into orbit and reaffirm its role as the West's only active launcher. The rocket blasted off at 7:28 p.m. from this jungle space center on the northern coast of South America Ariane's 21st launching and the first of eight planned for this year. Andre Payet, chief of mission, said no technical problems were reported and weather conditions were good for the launch of the rocket, owned by the European Space Agency.

The recently resigned head of Soviet space research says his country's maiden space shuttle launch had absolutely no scientific value, and the U.S. and Soviet shuttle programs are in deep trouble economically. Roald Z. Sagdeev, who headed the Soviet Space Research Institute for 15 years, said last week's inaugural Soviet shuttle flight like the 1981 flight of the first U.S. shuttle was an outstanding technological achievement. The shuttle, however, is technology of the 21st century.

The Air Force is bringing the B 2 stealth bomber, the crown jewel of its super secret black inventory, out from behind the veil of secrecy that has shrouded it for a decade. The high technology flying wing aircraft, designed to penetrate enemy radar defense and drop nuclear bombs, was being unveiled today by Northrop Corp. at a rollout ceremony although at a secure distance of 200 feet. It is simply not comparable to anything ever done before.

The judge in the Iran Contra case says President Reagan should consider the various courses of action he may take to stop the trial of Oliver L. North to prevent national security secrets from being disclosed. U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell did not say that Reagan should consider pardoning the four Iran Contra defendants but suggested other means by which the trial could be stopped. He said that under the Classified Information Procedures Act, Reagan could declare that the danger of disclosing highly sensitive government secrets was so great that the charges must be dropped.

BFN <F P=106> [Article by Shunji Taoka, AERA editorial staff member: No </F> U.S. Military Presence Seen In the 21st Century As Tension Mitigates ] [Text] National security policy planners are required to foresee what is ahead in the next l0 years or more if possible 30 years and at the same time, to review the past and present situation. If the upcoming national defense buildup program is going to cover a five year period as it has previously, it will cover the period from fiscal year 1996 to 2000. Warships, aircraft, and the like requisitioned under the program are to be made ready, and the reorganization of units is to be completed sometime around 2005.

What remains for us to determine is the rate at which this presence will be reduced and the nature of the relationship our two governments wish to pursue during and after this transitional period.
