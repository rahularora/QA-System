420 top_docs.420 <b>Pandoro 
420 top_docs.420 Pandoro (pan d'oro) is a traditional Italian sweet yeast bread, most popular around Christmas and New Year
420 top_docs.420 Typically a Veronese product, pandoro is traditionally shaped like a frustum with an 8 pointed-star section
420 top_docs.420 Modern taste sometimes calls for pandoro to have a hole cut into its bottom and a part of the soft interior to be removed, the cavity is then filled with chantilly cream or vanilla gelato
420 top_docs.420 Cream or gelato can be served as a garnish to pandoro slices
420 top_docs.420 Pandoro appeared in remote times, the product of the ancient art of breadmaking, as the name, Pan d'oro ("literally: Golden Bread"), suggests
420 top_docs.420 The first citation of a dessert clearly identified as Pandoro dates to the 18th century
420 top_docs.420 And it was at Verona, in Venetian territory, that the formula for making pandoro was developed and perfected, a process that required a century
420 top_docs.420 The modern history of this dessert bread began at Verona on October 30, 1894, when Domenico Melegatti obtained a patent for a procedure to be applied in producing pandoro industrially
420 top_docs.420 Pandoro was also the last meal eaten by the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini before his execution in 1945.

438 top_docs.438 <b>Titanium 
438 top_docs.438 Titanium (Ê/ta??te?ni?m/ ty-TAY-nee-?m) is a chemical element with the symbol Ti and atomic number 22. It has a low density and is a strong, lustrous, corrosion-resistant (including sea water, aqua regia and chlorine) transition metal with a silver color
438 top_docs.438 Titanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth for the Titans of Greek mythology
438 top_docs.438 Its most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and is used in the manufacture of white pigments.[4] Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene.[2] Titanium can be alloyed with iron, aluminium, vanadium, molybdenum, among other elements, to produce strong lightweight alloys for aerospace (jet engines, missiles, and spacecraft), military, industrial process (chemicals and petro-chemicals, desalination plants, pulp, and paper), automotive, agri-food, medical prostheses, orthopedic implants, dental and endodontic instruments and files, dental implants, sporting goods, jewelry, mobile phones, and other applications.[2] The two most useful properties of the metal form are corrosion resistance and the highest strength-to-weight ratio of any metal.[5] In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but 45% lighter.[6] There are two allotropic forms[7] and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element, 46Ti through 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8%).[8] Titanium's properties are chemically and physically similar to zirconium, because both of them have the same number of valence electrons and are in the same group in the periodic table
438 top_docs.438 A metallic element, titanium is recognized for its high strength-to-weight ratio.[7] It is a strong metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment),[2] lustrous, and metallic-white in color.[9] The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650Ê¡C or 3,000Ê¡F) makes it useful as a refractory metal
438 top_docs.438 It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity.[2] Commercial (99.2% pure) grades of titanium have ultimate tensile strength of about 63,000 psi (434 MPa), equal to that of common, low-grade steel alloys, but are 45% lighter.[6] Titanium is 60% more dense than aluminium, but more than twice as strong[6] as the most commonly used 6061-T6 aluminium alloy
438 top_docs.438 Certain titanium alloys (e.g., Beta C) achieve tensile strengths of over 200,000 psi (1,400ÊMPa).[10] However, titanium loses strength when heated above 430 ¡C (806Ê¡F).[11] It is fairly hard (although not as hard as some grades of heat-treated steel), non-magnetic and a poor conductor of heat and electricity
438 top_docs.438 Like those made from steel, titanium structures have a fatigue limit which guarantees longevity in some applications.[9] Titanium alloys specific stiffnesses are also usually not as good as other materials such as aluminium alloys and carbon fiber, so it is used less for structures which require high rigidity
438 top_docs.438 This phase is usually hexagonal (ideal) or trigonal (distorted) and can be viewed as being due to a soft longitudinal acoustic phonon of the ? phase causing collapse of (111) planes of atoms.[12] The most noted chemical property of titanium is its excellent resistance to corrosion; it is almost as resistant as platinum, capable of withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid as well as chlorine gas, chloride solutions, and most organic acids.[3] However, it is soluble in concentrated acids.[14] The Pourbaix diagram in the image shows that titanium is actually thermodynamically a very reactive metal
438 top_docs.438 However, it is slow to react with water and air, because it forms a passive and protective oxide coating that protects it from further reaction.[2] When it first forms, this protective layer is only 1Ð2 nm thick but continues to slowly grow; reaching a thickness of 25Ênm in four years.[15] Titanium readily reacts with oxygen at 1,200 ¡C (2,190Ê¡F) in air, and at 610 ¡C (1,130Ê¡F) in pure oxygen, forming titanium dioxide.[7] As a result, the metal cannot be melted in open air since it burns before the melting point is reached

490 top_docs.490 One theory is that the animals were brought to Europe by way of Guinea, leading people to think they had originated there.[26] "Guinea" was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far-off, unknown country, and so the name may simply be a colorful reference to the animal's foreignness.[30][31] Another theory suggests the "guinea" in the name is a corruption of "Guiana", an area in South America, though the animals are not native to that region.[30][32] A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold for the price of a guinea coin; this theory is untenable, because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663, and William Harvey used the term "Ginny-pig" as early as 1653.[33] Others believe "guinea" may be an alteration of the word coney (rabbit); guinea pigs were referred to as "pig coneys" in Edward Topsell's 1607 treatise on quadrupeds.[26] Guinea pigs are large for rodents, weighing between 700 and 1200Êg (1.5Ð2.5Êpounds), and measuring between 20 and 25Êcm (8Ð10Êinches) in length.[34] They typically live an average of four to five years, but may live as long as eight years.[35] According to the 2006 Guinness Book of Records the longest living guinea pig survived 14Êyears, 10.5Êmonths.[36] In the 1990s, a minority scientific opinion emerged proposing that caviomorphs, such as guinea pigs, chinchillas, and degus, are not rodents and should be reclassified as a separate order of mammals (similar to lagomorphs).[37][38] Subsequent research using wider sampling has restored consensus among mammalian biologists that the current classification of rodents as monophyletic is justified.[39][40] Cavia porcellus is not found naturally in the wild; it is likely descendant from some closely related species of cavies, such as Cavia aperea, Cavia fulgida, and Cavia tschudii, which are still commonly found in various regions of South America.[1] Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century, such as Cavia anolaimae and Cavia guianae, may be domestic guinea pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild.[12] Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of the cow

509 top_docs.509 Born in Bonn, then the capital of the Electorate of Cologne and part of the Holy Roman Empire, Beethoven moved to Vienna in his early 20s, studying with Joseph Haydn and quickly gaining a reputation as a virtuoso pianist
509 top_docs.509 Beethoven was the grandson of a musician of Flemish origin named Ludwig van Beethoven (1712Ð73) who moved at the age of twenty to Bonn.[2][3] (Ludwig is the German cognate of Dutch Lodewijk) who was employed as a bass singer at the court of the Elector of Cologne, rising to become Kapellmeister (music director). Ludwig had one son, Johann van Beethoven (1740Ð1792), who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment, also giving lessons on piano and violin to supplement his income.[2] Johann married Maria Magdalena Keverich in 1767; she was the daughter of Johann Heinrich Keverich, who had been the head chef at the court of the Archbishopric of Trier.[4] Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn

509 top_docs.509 Caspar Anton Carl was born on 8ÊApril 1774, and Nikolaus Johann, the youngest, was born on 2ÊOctober 1776.[8] Beethoven's first music teacher was his father
