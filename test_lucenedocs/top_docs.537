Seemingly unaffected, buffalo roam the parched South Dakota prairie on America's largest bison ranch while crops wither and domestic livestock suffer and even die because of the drought.

The hardy bison, native to North America, were hunted to near extinction in the late 1800s for its skins and meat.

Bison that blunder over the line from Yellowstone National Park are fair game for hunters again this winter, but park officials expect the harvest to be smaller than the 500 taken last season. Just how many of the big, furry, dumb beasts will wander outside the park boundaries to graze depends on how severe the winter is and how pinched the food supply within the park, officials say.

Yellowstone has about 2,500 bison in three major herds on its more than 2.4 million acres. But only the northern, or Lamar, herd, poses a concern to Montana ranchers. Because of a series of mild winters and other factors, the northern bison herd grew to more than 900 last year and most of them roamed along the Yellowstone River Valley into Montana where 569 of the animals were killed.

Montana's hunters and ranchers will be free to kill bison that stray from northern Yellowstone National Park this winter and as many as 200 of the animals might be killed, the state's wildlife director said today. Last year more than 500 Yellowstone bison were killed in Montana after they roamed from the park. That was an unprecedented number and prompted outcries from some environmentalists and conservationists.

Midwest buffalo buyers got a chance to place their bids at an unlikely auction site this week: Fermilab the only U.S. atom smashing facility with a herd of the proud beasts. While scientists rammed high energy atomic particles into each other underground in the world's most powerful accelerator, farmers and ranchers from Illinois and five other states on Thursday placed bids from a flatbed truck for 64 animals being sold so Fermilab could thin its herd before spring calving. I knew it was going to be a good sale, and it was, said Dan Shepherd, president of the National Buffalo Association and owner of 320 of the animals at his farm in Clifton Hill, Mo.

So Beaver, other natives in this subarctic wilderness and environmentalists around the world are coming to the defense of the 3,500 buffalo in and around Wood Buffalo National Park the largest free roaming herd in the world. ; The bison have been threatened with mass destruction by the Canadian government because many of them are afflicted with tuberculosis and brucellosis, diseases that could scar the lungs of cattle or cause them to abort. The disease is transmitted by physical contact and inhalation.

Besides that, any plan designed to keep animals in the park runs counter to park policy of keeping animals wild by allowing them natural movement through their natural habitat.

Almost 500 of Yellowstone's 2,700 bison have been shot in Montana and 250 additional permits have been issued.

A severe winter and loss of natural foods because of last summer's drought and huge fires have driven hundreds of elk and bison over the park boundary into southern Montana. In the small Montana town of Gardiner, north of the park, starving elk are eating ornamental hedges, trees, and hay donated by sympathetic people.

The big game herds are in no danger of extinction, but in some areas visitors may see fewer animals this year, he said. Even if winter kill (of northern herd elk) is 50 percent, there would still be a core that would rapidly reproduce, he said.

The ranchers' stated reason for protection is actually nothing more than a smoke screen to masquerade their true motives to eliminate competition from increasingly scarce grazing lands.

Horse thieves cut a hole in a fence and allowed at least 75 beefalo to wander onto the Florida Turnpike, leading to five minor accidents, an injury to a woman and the deaths of seven animals, police said. Five of the beefalo died in the accidents and two other injured animals had to be killed by Humane Society workers, the Florida Highway Patrol reported. The beefalo, part of a 400 head herd owned by Dr. Arnie Oper, roamed through a hole cut by thieves and ambled onto the turnpike extension north of Miami Sunday morning, said FHP Sgt.

Once replaced by a fatter breed of cattle, the legendary Texas Longhorn is on the comeback trail in grocery stores as Americans become more health conscious, cattle raisers say. Probably the largest hurdle we have is convincing old time cattle raisers they need to change, Bill Anthony, president of the International Texas Longhorn Association, said at the group's first meeting Thursday. Anthony, an Ardmore, Okla. rancher, started raising Longhorns 25 years ago and has fallen in love with the breed.

Breeds of the river buffalo are commonly found in the temperate climates of Italy, Albania, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, some areas of the Soviet Union, and in cold, mountainous areas of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nepal. Latin America countries are beginning to catch on to their value, the report said.

Government scientists say there is no quick solution to the problem of brucellosis spreading from wild bison and elk into cattle herds bordering Yellowstone National Park. A two day meeting of scientists and others from the departments of Agriculture and Interior was held here this week, but two senior officials said in a joint interview Thursday that no one is close to a decision on how to deal with the problem. Brucellosis of cattle has also been called Bang's disease and infectious abortion.

State wildlife officials put off a decision Thursday on a temporary plan to kill wandering bison from Yllowstone National Park to ensure they don't spread disease to cattle. The plan, which was the subject of a hearing, includes a provision to have federal rangers help state wardens kill the cows that wander outside the park. Officials say cows are more likely to carry the disease brucellosis than bulls, and putting the responsibility for their killing in the hands of wardens and rangers should reduce the chances of their spreading disease.

About half of the 2,500 to 3,000 bison in the 2 million acre park are believed to carry brucellosis, a disease that causes cattle to abort.

The USDA estimates per capita meat and poultry consumption in several ways, including the retail weight sold at grocery counters, and on a retail weight basis without bones. If it's the National Cattlemen's Association on an end of the year campaign to boost beef, the no bone way is favored. Regardless, the association said Thursday that demand for beef is stabilizing after declining for years.

Maybe Columbus didn't really discover America the locals met him on the beach but he brought a hedge against cholesterol 500 years before everybody started worrying about it. Argentine ranchers believe criollos, descendants of the hardy cattle Columbus carried across the sea, can be the basis of new crossbreeds that will produce leaner steaks for a diet conscious age. Columbus brought the first cattle to the New World on his second voyage in 1493, and more on his third and fourth trips, said Dr. Sol L. Rabasa, a genetecist.

Despite nearly five centuries of independent development, Rabasa said, the Texas longhorn and Argentine criollo have the same long, angular, short haired body and the same colors brown, red or piebald. Carlos E. Dawney, a rancher and association officer, said the only real difference is in the horns that give the Texas breed its name often 60 inches from tip to tip, longer than ours.
