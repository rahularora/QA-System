The popular belief that President Woodrow Wilson's wife ran the government after her husband's devastating stroke in 1919 is pure nonsense, according to a historian at Princeton University. History Professor Arthur Link, editor of a series of volumes of Wilson's papers, said the 64th volume, to be published in February, will prove that Mrs. Wilson served as a liaison but was not effectively an acting president in Wilson's final year in office. The volume quotes medical records and journals kept by Dr. Cary T. Grayson, Wilson's personal physician and confidant.

BROTHER WOODROW: A MEMOIR OF WOODROW WILSON by Stockton Axson, edited by Arthur S. Link Princeton University Press, 297 pages It is hard to remember that in 1918 19 Woodrow Wilson was the toast of Europe. Streets, boulevards and squares were renamed in his honour. Even the defeated Germans pinned their hopes to the American president's 'Fourteen Points'.

President Woodrow Wilson's behavior was affected by decreased blood flow to the brain during his oft criticized and ultimately futile campaign to have the United States join the League of Nations, a historian says. Records that were never made public show that Wilson was disabled by illness during the critical period in U.S. history after World War I, said Princeton University history Professor Arthur Link, editor of a series of volumes of Wilson's papers. It is one of the great tragedies of the 20th century, Link said in a recent interview.

The 2{ inch golden medallion, encased in a 14 inch high plexiglass cube, shimmers in a special spotlight on the mantel for all to see. Wilson's medal is now in the possession of the Library of Congress and will be placed on display at the Woodrow Wilson House in November and December in observance of Armistice Day. Wilson's prize was bestowed in 1920 after he failed to win U.S. support for his beloved League of Nations, and he felt very vindicated by the peace prize, said Patricia Sullivan, the director of the museum at the Wilson House.

What Mr. Smith does do very well is to trace the origins of think tanks to the progressive era's belief that government would inevitably become too complex and large for mere citizen politicians to manage. Experts would be needed to analyze the growing mass of economic data the government was collecting. Other experts would then come up with solutions to solve the problems quantified by that data.

For the spoils of this contest will go either to a Yale man or a Harvard man only the second time in 200 years that graduates of the two schools have vied for the presidency of the United States. And the only other time it happened, in 1912, the Harvard man, Theodore Roosevelt, and the Yale man, William Howard Taft, both lost to a Princeton man, Woodrow Wilson. While Kennedy was a master at exploiting his Harvard education for political advantage, Republican George Bush, Yale class of 1948, has tried to turn Democrat Michael S. Dukakis' Harvard connections into a campaign liability.

Scientific researchers in American universities should be required to disclose financial relationships with industry that might create conflicts of interest, a congressional subcommittee was told Tuesday.

Clearly Reagan has had trouble with national security advisers, running through six in seven years, said Hess. Dukakis has not said publicly who he might appoint national security adviser or secretary of state if he is elected. But among those often mentioned for those two important posts are Allison and two colleagues from the Kennedy School, Joseph Nye and Albert Carnesdale, along with Madeleine Albright, a Czechoslovakian born Georgetown University professor who served in the Carter White House.

While politicians normally don't want to be linked with women other than their wives, there's one gal that candidates have been fawning over for more than 100 years. She's 151 feet tall and stands demurely in New York Harbor. Candidates and their image makers say there's no better company to be seen in especially on coast to coast television than that of the Statue of Liberty.

When organizers at Arizona State University invited Ronald Reagan to give a speech last month, fewer than one fourth of the 10,000 tickets were sold in advance and the former president agreed to waive his $50,000 fee. Reagan, who commanded vast audiences until he left office in January ago, is now out of the limelight, retired into the select club of former presidents that includes Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. Occasionally, the former president pops back into the news.

Reagan has been virtually mum on the presidency of his successor, and he is rarely mentioned in Washington. One way for former presidents to step back into the limelight is to take a shot at their predecessor. Thus, Jimmy Carter made the news in 1981 when he criticized Reagan's budget proposal for placing too much emphasis on defense spending and not enough on domestic programs.

Poverty in America's cities has grown more persistent and concentrated over the last two decades and its victims have less chance of escape, according to a report by the National League of Cities. The study describes a changing face of poverty since 1970, with the nation's poor more likely now to live in metropolitan areas and concentrate in low income neighborhoods. It said the proportion of children living in poverty has increased and the likelihood of people climbing above the poverty level has declined.

The study said blacks and Hispanics were more likely than whites to live in extremely poor neighborhoods, and poverty among blacks was more persistent than for other groups. More than 21 percent of blacks living in big cities were persistently poor throughout the 10 years between 1974 and 1983, it said, compared to a rate of less than 3 percent for non blacks. The poverty rate among children, it said, grew from 16 percent in 1979 to over 20 percent in 1985, which it called a startling increase.

That's the trouble with catchy phrases they're catchy. So when George Bush said yes, or at least maybe, to new taxes, everybody in America already knew that he had said no 1,000 times and said it in a catchy way: Read my lips no new taxes. Bush is not the first president to break a campaign promise, but he was so downright unequivocal that his about face will go down as part of the history of the Bush presidency.

He tries to quantify broken promises. He studied the campaign promises of five recent presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Reagan and compared them to proposals actually advanced when the candidates became president.
