It's an old story in the gambling industry. States where lotteries are legal invariably sell a big share of their tickets to and earn a major chunk of their profits from people who live in neighboring states where lotteries aren't allowed. After watching revenue dribble away to state governments next door, the lottery free states usually come to rethink their position and start games of their own.

Britain's new national lottery opens for business in about a year, promising big cash prizes to the punters and much needed tax revenues for the UK government. For the consortium chosen to operate the lottery, however, it also poses some daunting technical problems, not least of which will be setting up one of the largest computer networks in the world in around six months. The eight consortia expected to bid for the licence next month agree that, while the technology involved is relatively simple, the sheer size of the network, coupled with strict requirements for reliability and security, will make building the necessary computer system a tortuous task.

RULE ONE in the lottery business: The bigger the jackpot, the more tickets you sell. So if you're running a state lottery that offers relatively small cash awards, and you know that hundreds perhaps thousands of your potential customers are playing the multimillion dollar lottery in the big state next door, your strategy is pretty clear: Double, triple or quadruple your own grand prize, and keep those ticket sales at home. That's exactly what Iowa and Missouri, whose citizens are regular players in the wealthy lottery in neighboring Illinois, hope to do.

Multistate games aren't the only way to draw more players; states can also change the odds on an existing game. Illinois did that in April, introducing a new Wednesday night lotto drawing that makes it easier to win a cheap prize (last week it was one chance in 89 to win $12 on a $1 ticket), but tougher to win the grand prize (one chance in 15.4 million). The idea paid off late last month, when the jackpot reached $22 million, Illinois's highest in three years.

Lottery officials upped the state Lotto jackpot to $62 million today a national record as gamblers and dreamers from as far away as Europe clamored to play. The geographical range is something we've never seen before, Illinois Lottery Director Sharon Sharp said Thursday. Travelers passing through O'Hare International Airport jammed Lotto booths, where sales for Saturday's drawing have been just about double the average, said Bob Flynn of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, which runs the six Lotto kiosks.

Winners have 180 days to claim their prizes. Lottery offices are closed until Tuesday. Although lottery officials can't project the exact payout until Tuesday, the annual payment to one winner would be about $2.16 million each year after taxes, using a lottery department formula that divides total winnings by 20 years and deducts 20 percent of the yearly windfall for taxes.

Supporters of state lotteries see the games and their burgeoning popularity due to multimillion dollar jackpots as a way to increase government revenue without raising taxes, but critics say the games are a bad bet for many people. In states where lottery revenue goes toward education, the lottery can stiffen public resistance to paying higher taxes to support schools, critics say. They also say lotteries have no impact on the services they were designed to finance because the money is used to replace, rather than supplement, other revenue sources.

A projected $55 million plus lottery prize that would return the North American title for big jackpots to the state is making Californians' gambling fever rise again. Lottery officials and merchants said ticket sales for the Saturday drawing were running about double the usual pace for Thursday's sales. The official estimate of over $55 million for the drawing is conservative, based on similar situations in the two year history of California's computerized Lotto 6 49 game, said lottery spokesman Bob Taylor.

When nobody picks all six winning numbers out of a choice 49, the jackpot is rolled over, or added, to the top prize for the next twice weekly drawing.
