Free speech, including the right to wear offensive T shirts, has returned to the campus of Tufts University after President Jean Mayer decided a ban on verbal attacks wouldn't wash in court. I have decided we are better off erring in the tradition of free speech, Tufts President Jean Mayer said Thursday in an interview. We decided we would decide each case on its merits.

Six years after he last taught at Tufts University, John Sununu remains on the school faculty in what one official calls an extremely rare arrangement that allows his children to receive tuition waivers and other aid. Sununu, the New Hampshire governor chosen to serve as White House chief of staff in the Bush administration, last week declined to be discuss the arrangement but said last summer, I never asked for any different treatment. This was all done by the board of trustees.

But Mayer recommended the Committee on Student Life reconsider that sentence, which it eventually suspended when lawyers advised it was unconstitutional. The student life committee, comprising faculty and students, imposed the free speech restriction last June on the campus abut six miles outside Boston.

John Sununu remains on the faculty of Tufts University six years after he last taught there, an arrangement that has allowed his children to receive tuition waivers and aid from the school. The New Hampshire governor, who is President elect George Bush's choice as White House chief of staff, has had two children enrolled in Tufts since he left the university and also has children attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass., and Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif. The children attending Tufts are granted full tuition waivers and those at other colleges receive tuition subsidies from Tufts as part of faculty benefits Sununu has received during his six years on leave from the school, according to Tufts officials.

A report from Secret Service experts said at least five and possibly 25 pages in one of Ms. Imanishi Kari's notebooks were filled in as much as two years after the dates on the page, and at least two dates were changed.

About 350 students from Tufts University will discuss the Cold War and nuclear arms race in a classroom session with undergraduate counterparts in the Soviet Union via television, the school said. The March 5 teleconference is the first of three scheduled sessions between students from Tufts and Moscow State University in a jointly run course on the superpowers' arms buildup. Tufts professor Martin J. Sherwin, course instructor and director of Tufts' Nuclear Age History and Humanities Center, said the project coincides with the rise of glasnost, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of openness.

Students at Tufts University can wear T shirts with raunchy messages in dorm rooms and on campus lawns, but not in classrooms under a new policy that officials said Thursday tries to balance free speech with decorum. We feel it's our obligation to say that there are no constituencies that are fair game, said Dean of Students Bobbie Knable. The T shirt zones were created after a male student marketed 200 T shirts that gave 15 reasons Why Beer is Better than Women at Tufts, all disparaging to women.

Justice Department officials Wednesday acknowledged an investigation was under way, but refused to disclose details. Antitrust division investigations are not a matter of public record, agency spokesman David Runkel said.

Some 20 prestigious colleges and universities may have violated federal antitrust laws by exchanging certain financial information at meetings that are apparently the target of a Justice Department investigation, antitrust experts and former government officials said. The key to whether antitrust violations could be proven would depend on whether federal prosecutors find that the schools agreed to fix tuition increases for specific years or scholarship amounts for specific students, the antitrust experts said. The schools' main justification that they exchange certain financial information to avoid an unseemly bidding war for top students probably wouldn't carry much weight in court if the government decided to bring suit to block the longstanding practice, the antitrust experts agreed.

The panel included two Americans who worked on the top secret Manhattan Project that developed the first atomic bomb in 1945, and a Soviet researcher who helped build that country's first nuclear weapon in 1949.

A scientist won't testify at a Congressional panel investigating accusations that she falsified data in a genetics research paper she had written with a Nobel Prize winner, her attorney said Friday. She feels very much hounded ... by an unwarranted intervention and intrusion by the government into the scientific process, said Bruce A. Singal, attorney for Dr. Thereza Imanishi Kari of Tufts University. Imanishi Kari is declining to testify Monday before a House subcommittee reviewing charges she misrepresented research reported in a 1986 article published in the scientific journal Cell.

Tufts University President Jean Mayer, one of the nation's best known nutritionists, has taken much of the confusion out of eating well and losing weight. Dr. Jean Mayer's Diet &amp; Nutrition Guide, written with Jeanne P. Goldberg, provides a compact and generally sensible path for children and adults, but is somewhat disorganized and fairly conservative. Mayer and Goldberg, a Tufts School of Nutrition professor, are widely known for their newspaper column Food for Thought, written in a question and answer format.

Blood tests now typically require medical workers to draw blood into tubes for analyzing in remote laboratories, a process that can take minutes to hours. The method can lead to errors from naturally occurring changes in the chemistry of blood as it is moved, from contamination of the equipment it touches and from mixups in handling. During the past few years, bedside blood analyzers have been developed to speed measurements of certain blood components.

The Justice Department is asking several prestigious universities for documents as part of an antitrust investigation into how they set tuition and student aid rates, officials say. The department, while declining to discuss the thrust of the investigation, acknowledged that it is seeking certain documents. Daniel Steiner, general counsel at Harvard University, said the request was for documents dealing with student financial aid, budgeting and other fees and salaries.

Dr. Priscilla White, whose research sharply increased the survival rate of babies born to diabetic women, died at age 89 after a long illness. White died Saturday at her home in this Boston suburb, according to a statement from the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. Her studies identified ways to decrease the risk of maternal and child death in pregnancies complicated by diabetes, the statement said.

Many underwriters speculate that such doctors face financial responsibilities that drive them to take on grossly excessive work loads, particularly surgical procedures, for which they are not adequately trained, the study said. The finding could also stem from the gradual accrual of evidence on negligent doctors that reaches a critical mass only after they have practiced a decade or more, Dr. Schwartz said.

The finding could also stem from the gradual accrual of evidence on negligent doctors that reaches a critical mass only after they have practiced a decade or more, Dr. Schwartz said. The researchers also found that foreign trained doctors aren't overrepresented among those who lost coverage and that neurosurgeons, plastic surgeons and some other specialists tend to lose coverage more often than expected, even when the high rate of claims in their fields is taken into account.

The state on Friday sent park rangers to guard the site on an emergency basis as word of the cavern's existence began to leak out. The bill was quickly enacted Wednesday to allow the state to continue to oversee the land. The cavern's co discoverer, Randy Tufts, 39, said that finding it along with Gary Tenen, 37, was a once in a lifetime discovery for the caver.

A sunburn meter may soon tell beachgoers they've been in the sun too long. Xytronyx Inc., a San Diego based maker of health products, has developed a set of chemicals that change color with increasing exposure to ultraviolet rays, the invisible portion of the sun's rays that cause tanning and burning. The company plans to use the chemicals in a Band Aidlike patch that can be put on the skin of sunbathers, or a badge that can be attached to a swimsuit.

MILE A MINUTE weed is a new threat to young trees in the middle Atlantic states and possibly nationwide. The weed, a vine with triangular leaves and an iridescent blue berry, is a kind of horizontal version of Jack's beanstalk. It can grow as rapidly as six inches a day and can grow from seed to 25 feet in a single season.

The weed, a vine with triangular leaves and an iridescent blue berry, is a kind of horizontal version of Jack's beanstalk. It can grow as rapidly as six inches a day and can grow from seed to 25 feet in a single season. It overruns and smothers other vegetation and thus poses a threat to orchards, Christmas tree farms, shrub nurseries and reforestation efforts.

Barbara Tuchman's Guns of August (1962) did not stimulate the guild of academic historians, but the literary historians such as Mr. Fussell and the new scholars in technology saw World War I as a watershed of political engagement by intellectuals as well as the start of really terrifying technological innovations, such as poison gas, tanks, airplanes and, above all, the machine gun.

This was a war that began with saber charges and red white and blue uniforms. It ended with four foot rats and the near total destruction of a generation.

To understand today's world, we examine the impact of Darwinism, chauvinism and the nationalism of an Olympic movement that started in 1896 amid hopes of international brotherhood, and soon degenerated into the worst kind of sports warfare.
