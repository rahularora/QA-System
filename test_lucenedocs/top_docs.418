The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a complaint charging two companies and 14 people with running a penny stock scam that bilked investors of at least $10 million. The complaint, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Chicago, alleges the defendants secretly controlled the stock of the two companies and artificially raised the share price before selling at large profits. When investors discovered that the companies had little or no real assets, they were left holding the bag, said Stanley Whitten, chief investigator for the SEC's Chicago office.

A retarded man who has spent nearly 32 years in a state mental hospital will soon be released because the Utah Supreme Court says he was mistakenly ruled insane after he confessed to a 1955 slaying. He was just a convenient suspect, attorney Brooke Wells said of client Bernt Murphy, a 51 year old man with the mental capacity of an 8 year old. Third District Judge Pat Brian is expected to rule by Feb. 6 on how much freedom Murphy should be granted.

Nine individuals, including a former purchasing officer for Morton Thiokol Inc., and eight companies were charged Friday in Salt Lake City in connection with a fraud and kickback scheme against Thiokol and the government. A 98 count indictment alleged that John E. Ward, who was the purchasing agent at Thiokol's Wasatch division in northern Utah from 1979 until last year, inflated the cost of materials he obtained from various suppliers for use in Thiokol's space shuttle and weapons programs. The indictment said Mr. Ward channeled the supplies through three companies he operated out of his basement: Complete Industrial, D. Jones Co. and Unisupply Co. Federal officials said Mr. Ward relabeled the supplies before selling them to Thiokol at inflated prices.

The decision to close Fort Douglas, a 119 acre Army installation built in 1862 to protect stagecoach routes from Indians and keep an eye on Mormon settlers, came as little surprise Thursday. The once strategic post in the Wasatch Mountain foothills east of downtown Salt Lake City had long been criticized in Congress as contributing little to national defense. The government commission that put the fort on a list of installations to be shut down or scaled back estimated that closing Fort Douglas a collection of parade grounds, barracks and other brick and whitewashed buildings, some dating from the 1920s and 1930s would save $1.4 million over 20 years.

In letters to Luken's subcommittee, the companies said their Japanese advertising agency arranged the $350,000 deal to promote the Lark brand. The agreement calls for the movie to include a scene in which Agent 007 pulls out an explosive device disguised as a package of Larks. The letters were in response to a request to all American tobacco companies seeking a 10 year inventory of motion pictures in which the companies paid to have their product or brand name featured.

An instructor's failure to keep his plane out of restricted airspace on a student training flight was the primary cause of a 1987 collision that killed 10 people in Utah, a federal panel concluded Tuesday. The single engine training plane and a SkyWest commuter plane collided near Kearns, Utah, on Jan. 15, 1987, while making an approach to Salt Lake City International Airport after a flight from Pocatello, Idaho. The National Transportation Safety Board absolved the air traffic controller handling the SkyWest plane.

The disappearance of six children of dead polygamist leader Ervil LeBaron dims hopes of breaking two decades of religious violence in which more than 20 people were slain, authorities say. The six fled foster homes in Salt Lake City on Friday and may be headed to a family hideout in Mexico, authorities said. It's sad, said Dave Schwendiman, assistant U.S. Attorney for Utah, who heads a LeBaron Crime Family task force.

A policeman whose mysterious disappearance a week ago had prompted a manhunt turned up in Salt Lake City and told police he had walked away because of stress in his personal life, authorities said today. David Hayhurst, 39, was wearing his Denver police officer's uniform when he showed up at a Salt Lake City convenience store Thursday night and asked the clerk to call authorities. Investigators initially had feared Hayhurst, a 17 year veteran, had met foul play while on routine patrol.

Leucadia National Corp. said it repeatedly has approached Utah Power &amp; Light Co. about buying two thirds of the company for at least $30 a share in cash, or $1.19 billion. The New York based holding company said it made the overtures, as recently as last month, as an alternative to a merger plan that faces some federal government opposition. Under that plan, each Utah Power share would be swapped for shares of PacifiCorp, a utility based in Portland, Ore., in a transaction valued at $32.25 to $38 a share, or $1.9 billion to $2.24 billion.
