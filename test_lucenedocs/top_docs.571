In most non citrus fruits, that hormone is ethylene, and it is made inside the fruit itself, according to John Labavitch, a biochemist at the University of California, Davis, who studies the ripening process.

Hair and makeup are the keys to a bride's beauty, and she should devote as much care and attention to them as she does to the selection of her dress, says Denise O'Donoghue, Bride's magazine beauty editor.

A sports medicine expert says ailments such as black heel, bikini bottom, jogger's nipples and toxic sock syndrome bother athletes and fitness fans more often than broken bones or strained muscles. Skin injuries such as these are among the most common of locker room complaints, says medical professor Rodney S. W. Basler, whose list of athletic ailments also includes runner's rump and surfer's nodules. The skin bears the brunt of the punishment from exercise and develops injuries in unexpected ways, Basler said Wednesday in an interview at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology.

Investigators are trying to determine whether the Ohio State Fair's grand champion steer, Hank, also goes by the name Carl, a ribbon winner at an Illinois farm show. The key piece of evidence is a patch of white hair on Hank's underside that had been dyed black, an Ohio state fair official said. Coloring the animal's hide is itself a violation, but fair officials are also investigating whether Hank was shown as Carl three weeks earlier at the Iroquois County Fair in Illinois, where it won a second place ribbon.

</P> <P> Although helping young girls take pride in their appearance is desirable, placing too much emphasis on physical beauty can have negative effects on a woman's self image, says Dawne Schoenholz, a Santa Monica based psychologist who studies family relationships. The mother who is narcissistic and spends a disproportionate amount of time grooming gives her daughter a distorted sense of value, Schoenholz says. The young girl begins to believe that the image in the mirror is all important.

The United States has won the backing of the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France for a U.N. resolution threatening to use all necessary means to drive Iraq from Kuwait if it does not leave by January. With the agreement Monday among the five permanent Security Council members, the broad coalition the United States has mustered against Saddam Hussein crossed a crucial threshold, authorizing the use of military force. There had been speculation the Soviets and Chinese might abstain on the resolution, which the 15 member council is expected to take up on Thursday.
