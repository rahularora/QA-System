Bok choy and escarole aren't crops for every farmer, but an Agriculture Department economist says such exotic food items are catching the eye of supermarket shoppers. Increasingly, produce counters are also including fruits that are a bit off the trodden path of consumers: pomegranates, guava, kumquats, and melons named Santa Clause, Casaba and Crenshaw. Specialty fruit and vegetable displays form a fundamental part of the new up scale image of many produce sections, said Catherine Greene of the department's Economic Research Service.

The Agriculture Department says the value of U.S. agricultural exports jumped 26 percent to a four year high of $35.2 billion in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30. Actual quantities of grain and other commodities totaled 147.5 million metric tons, up 14 percent from 129.2 million tons shipped in 1986 87 when the value was $27.9 billion. The new figures released Wednesday were up from the previous forecast issued on Aug. 25, when the value was projected at $34 billion and the volume at 146 million tons.

Despite the sharp gains, the year's totals were still far below the record levels of $43.8 billion and 162.3 million tons in 1980 81 before world economic conditions, high interest rates, foreign competition and other economic factors triggered annual declines.

This year's drought reduced grain and soybean harvests will mean sharply higher feed costs for livestock producers in the coming year, with some items costing almost half again as much, says the Agriculture Department. Drought and hot weather reduced total feed grain production by 34 percent this year to the smallest total since 1983. Prices of feed grains, mostly corn, are expected to average 25 percent to 45 percent above last year's weighted average of $76.70 per ton, the department's Economic Research Service said Wednesday.

An ivory pomegranate, believed to be the only existing relic of Solomon's Temple, has gone on display at the Israel Museum after officials paid $550,000 into a secret Swiss bank account. The thumb sized object, which measures 1.68 inches by .83 inches, has a hole in the bottom and may have been used as the top of a scepter carried by a temple priest.

Supermarket produce counters are taking on a special look these days, with bean sprouts, bok choy, guava and other exotic items catching the eye of food shoppers, says an Agriculture Department economist. Specialty fruit and vegetable displays form a fundamental part of the new up scale image of many produce sections, says Catherine Greene of the department's Economic Research Service. Rising demand for specialty produce is in line with a general increase in fruit and vegetable consumption, she says.

Supermarket produce counters are taking on a special look these days, with bean sprouts, bok choy, guava and other exotic items catching the eye of food shoppers, an Agriculture Department economist said Wednesday. Specialty fruit and vegetable displays form a fundamental part of the new up scale image of many produce sections, said Catherine Greene of the department's Economic Research Service. Rising demand for specialty produce is in line with a general increase in fruit and vegetable consumption, she said.

The very idea that the chrysanthemum, the iris or the carnation (let alone, shudder, shudder, the poor old spray carnation) would be given such a heave ho by the chicken wire and 'oasis' set would have been enough to confirm them in their vision of a world gone mad. But I am sure that those of you who are even now planning the decorations for the festive season at chateau mon repos would like to know that the marigold (once a real no no) is back in favour.
