Senior officers of the royal household responsible for the Pounds 20m of taxpayers' money spent each year on Buckingham Palace and other residences occupied by the Queen and her family face closer scrutiny by MPs. A report by the Commons public accounts committee published yesterday rejects voluntary arrangements under which information about the use of the money is made available. It calls for 'public visibility' of the Pounds 20m a year of public money involved, with the National Audit Office having an automatic right of access to the relevant documents.

WINDSOR CASTLE is the largest inhabited castle in the world and has been the sovereign's official residence for more than 800 years. The original castle at Windsor, a fortified earthwork surrounded by a dry ditch, was built by William the Conqueror in about 1070 as one of a chain of strongholds to control the area around London. It was rebuilt and enlarged over the centuries, although the outline still follows the shape of the original earthwork.

All these rooms represent part of the complete transformation of the castle by King George IV in the 1820s. There is no doubt that George IV, both as King and Prince Regent, was the finest royal patron of the arts since King Charles I. Windsor Castle was extensively altered by Charles II, but by the 19th century it had become unsuitable for the residence of the sovereign of a major world power.

AS SMOKE and steam lingered yesterday over the ashes of what were once some of the most stately of Windsor Castle's 1,000 rooms, it became clear that the art treasures had been less damaged by Friday's fire than had previously been feared. Last night, Buckingham Palace and Department of National Heritage officials agreed that the biggest task arising from the blaze, which raged through the 800 year old castle for several hours, is the restoration of the building's fabric. Some of the worst damaged rooms had been stripped of most contents as part of a three year renovation programme which had been under way for months.

Reports of how the fire started, ranging from a workman's cigarette to a welding torch, were also dismissed as speculative. A team of forensic experts arrived yesterday to investigate the cause.

In November, a month before Gorbachev originally was scheduled to visit Britain, reports of a Soviet prospective invitation to the queen started circulating and Mrs. Thatcher let it be known she thought it was too soon to give such a resounding stamp of approval to the Soviet leader's reform plans. At a news conference in London Friday night, Soviet officials were asked whether the palace or British government had insisted the Soviets apologize for the treatment of the Russian royal family before the queen accepted the invitation.

The fact that the queen could see the graves of her relations, and repair the damage done after the Russian Revolution in a Christian and religious way, would perhaps bring these countries closer together than anyone ever thought possible, he said.

One of the major consequences of the Queen's 'annus horribilis' has been an increase in public debate abut the Royal Collection.

In the age of the photograph, the uses of the work of art as a thing of topographical or architectural record may often be overlooked, but the argument remains.

There was Turner, watching from the river as the old Houses of Parliament went up in flames: there was Paul Sandby, noting down the informal daily life of the Windsor Castle of the later 18th century: there too, under darker neo romantic skies, was John Piper, seeing the Castle in wartime through more dramatic eyes 'you don't seem to have had much luck with the weather, Mr Piper', remarked the King.

That said, it may well be that so strong and extraordinary was the experience afforded him by the devastation of Windsor Castle, that there was nothing for it but for him to lose himself and all his skill in the magnificent awfulness before him which is precisely why his Windsor work is so successful. Is there is to the accompanying group of paintings, of great houses from Rome to St Petersburg, something rather less of the intuitive excitement, rather more of the mechanical and, dare I say, complacent?

'Take the train to Windsor for an unforgettable day out' gushes NetWork SouthEast's latest lavishly illustrated poster. Among the attractions on the poster, promoting cheap fares, is a cut away drawing of Windsor Castle which clearly depicts St George's Hall 'primarily used for banquets' and the Waterloo Chamber which 'the Royal Family use for their Christmas pantomime'. Bit odd, since both these imposing state rooms were all but destroyed in last year's fire.

Smallwood said Morshead related the secret to them as they gazed out of the castle windows onto the grounds where there was a round pond. According to the newspaper, Smallwood related that Morshead said the king told him the crown jewels represented the honors and the kingdom of England and must not fall into German hands.

HISTORIC building and art experts are to meet shortly to make preliminary plans for the restoration of the castle's damaged state apartments. They are expected to report within a month. The extent of the damage will possibly take weeks to establish, as the structure has to be inspected, and rescued and lost pictures and furnishings checked against the castle's inventory.

The extent of the damage will possibly take weeks to establish, as the structure has to be inspected, and rescued and lost pictures and furnishings checked against the castle's inventory. First priority will be to put a temporary roof over the burnt out sections to keep out rain, dampness and frost that could further affect masonry and timbers weakened by the fire and the thousands of gallons of water pumped on the blaze.

Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow heritage secretary, was 'casting doubt' on the Berkshire fire service by making such a claim, Mr Brooke said.

As the castle is being rewired and repaired, guests cannot be shown round so we took the opportunity to send some interesting things to the gallery, Everett said in an interview at Wednesday's preview. Even the prophetic thoughts of King George III after the British defeat by the American colonists in 1781 are displayed: America is lost!

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived Wednesday night from Cuba for a 40 hour visit that will mix hard talk on human rights with traditional British pageantry. Flying from the sweltering Caribbean into freezing British rain at Heathrow Airport, Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, got a red carpet welcome with a royal military band. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher welcomed them with a warm smile on the tarmac after the plane touched down at 11 p.m. After the Soviet national anthem was played, Gorbachev and Mrs. Thatcher walked briskly under a pink umbrella past the honor guard of the Royal Air Force.

A jury found Fagan innocent of stealing a bottle of Californian wine which he drank during a break in at the palace earlier in 1982.

A jury found Fagan innocent of stealing a bottle of Californian wine which he drank during a break in at the palace earlier in 1982. He was never charged with breaking in to the palace because it was regarded as trespassing, a civil offense, and the palace wouldn't take him to court.

In a rare appeal for personal sympathy, the Queen suggested to her critics that scrutiny 'can be just as effective if it is made with a touch of gentleness, good humour and understanding'.

As soon as you reach the first floor you are thrown another dramatic theme: this building is about majesty. Everything, every object, every vista, every cornice, every fabric, proclaims wealth and splendour.

As soon as you reach the first floor you are thrown another dramatic theme: this building is about majesty. Everything, every object, every vista, every cornice, every fabric, proclaims wealth and splendour. You quickly accept that the palace contains the finest collection of Sevres porcelain; unequalled examples of French 18th century furniture by Weisweiler, Carlin, and Reisener; and a picture collection stuffed with Rubens, Rembrandts, and Van Dycks.

Amid such ornate decoration the actual Throne Room can dare to be quite sparse, bereft of thrones, but with two comfortable looking chairs embroidered with an 'EII' and a 'P'.

After a surfeit of decorative grandeur the Picture Gallery becomes almost pedestrian. I thought it one of the least successful rooms, with its shrimp pink wall covering, grills to the electric fires barely hidden inside marble, and the worthiness of the collection, the 18th century's homage to the artists of the 17th.

There are splendid things, the Rembrandt portrait of Agatha Bas; the Rubens of St George; the Cuyp of a negro page.

Having lulled the visitor into a dreamy acceptance of the luxurious the tour ends with a jolt in the finest and happiest rooms, all designed by Nash, with plenty of quirky detail.

Having lulled the visitor into a dreamy acceptance of the luxurious the tour ends with a jolt in the finest and happiest rooms, all designed by Nash, with plenty of quirky detail. There is the extraordinary sculpted memorial to that arch republican Milton in the Blue Drawing Room; the critical line of portraits in the State Dining Room (bereft of its table and silver); the fake door of looking glass and pier table in the White Drawing Room through which the royal family materialises to startle its guests.

It is a hushed finale. Of course these are state apartments, absent of any manifestation of a living majesty. But through the windows of the charming Music Room you see a red coated servant keeping a wary eye on three waddling corgies, and as you stroll through the garden to the exit you call at the shop and buy the chocolates, crockery and videos, plus the excellent guide to the palace prepared by Apollo magazine, which, with the Pounds 8 entry fee, will help the Queen raise approaching Pounds 3m in the next eight weeks towards the restoration of Windsor Castle.

The palace, so austere from the outside, offers a stunning, unsettling surfeit of an experience, eased by the charm of the attendants.

AN INQUIRY into the costs of maintaining royal palaces such as Windsor Castle, which was partly destroyed by fire last week, was proposed last night by a cross party Commons committee. The public accounts committee has asked Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor general, to consider launching a 'value for money' study into the Department of National Heritage and Royal Palaces owned by the state. However, in spite of pressure from some Labour MPs, the committee has decided that it will not at least at this stage look at wider issues of the financing of the Royal Family and whether the Queen should pay tax.

In a private meeting last night, MPs on the public accounts committee discussed the possibility of a wider inquiry into the Royal Family's finances but no agreement was reached.
