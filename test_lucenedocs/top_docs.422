PROPOSALS FOR statutory controls on the press were rejected by Mr John Major yesterday amid disclosures that at least one member of the Royal family had sanctioned leaks about their personal life to tabloid newspapers. Downing Street officials said the prime minister would not support the creation of a tribunal with legal authority to impose sanctions against newspapers judged to have breached strict new privacy rules. His stance was revealed as ministers tacitly confirmed reports that the Princess of Wales had played a behind the scenes role in press coverage last year of the break up of her marriage to Prince Charles.

His stance was revealed as ministers tacitly confirmed reports that the Princess of Wales had played a behind the scenes role in press coverage last year of the break up of her marriage to Prince Charles. There was no confirmation that Prince Charles had done likewise.

THE PRINCE and Princess of Wales are to separate, Buckingham Palace announced yesterday, but the government said the princess could still become Queen. Mr John Major told MPs the decision had no constitutional implications and there were 'no plans' for the couple to divorce. Prince Charles's succession as head of the Church of England, which frowns on divorce, was also unaffected.

Prince Charles flew home Friday with the body of a friend who was killed by a Swiss avalanche that nearly engulfed the future king as it roared down a mountain in a terrifying matter of seconds. With Maj. Hugh Lindsay's pregnant widow, Sarah, the prince watched as six soldiers from his dead friend's Royal Lancers regiment bore the flag draped coffin from the red and white jet of the Queen's Flight. The 39 year old heir to the throne was praised for helping save the life of another skier in his party but called foolhardy for skiing perilous slopes off the main trails of the Klosters resort.
