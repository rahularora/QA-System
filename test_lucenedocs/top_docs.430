The Northern Ireland peace process could have a knock on effect on Spain's Basque Country where regional elections on Sunday are widely viewed as setting the stage for similar negotiations to end violence by Eta, the separatist organisation. The vote among the 2.1m Basques, who since 1979 have enjoyed increasing home rule, is also seen as a watershed poll that could undermine the nationalist rhetoric and extremist calls for secession from Spain that has dominated much of local politics. Opinion polls indicate that the Partido Nacionalista Vasco, PNV, the mainstream nationalist party, will remain the dominant force but that there will be big gains by Madrid based parties the conservative People's party (PP) and the communist coalition, Izquierda Unida (IU) which had formerly been on the sidelines of Basque politics.

BFN <F P=106> [Unattributed report: Condemnation of Speech by Arzalluz, </F> Who Is Accused of Isolating Basque Country ] [Excerpt] Bilbao Several political leaders yesterday harshly criticized the remarks of PNV [Basque Nationalist Party] Chairman Xabier Arzalluz, who referred on Aberri Eguna [Basque fatherland day] to those who talk a great deal about ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty], when they have headings and articles in their Constitution, designed for Reds and separatists, in which they entrust their fatherland's unity to the Army, weapons, and violence. The leaders of the nationwide parties in the Basque Country accused Arzalluz of isolating the Basque Country through his radicalism, which, in the opinion of both the PSE [Basque Socialist Party] and the People's Party of the Basque Country, stems from the proximity of the Basque autonomous community elections. The harshest criticisms yesterday came from the Basque Socialists, of whom Aznar said a few days ago that they are not Basques.

In statements made to the Spanish Radio Broadcasting Company network, the PNV's top leader said that the Basque people could win this independence if they wished, but I am a Basque nationalist, and there are people here in the Basque Country who are not nationalists, and what I believe is that what we win should be won by a clear majority. Arzalluz showed himself in favor of a Basque state within Europe, although he admitted that this is impossible right now, because there is the Army, which guarantees that there will be no dismemberment of what is called national territory.

Asuncion is an intelligent man and knows what is at issue, but 24 hours elapsed before Asuncion spoke, and very grave things were said here, and the matter of Article 8 of the Constitution is the least of it, he said. The nationalist leader said that the harsh reaction by the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] to his Aberri Eguna speech did not surprise him, and added that Ramon Jauregui and Mario Onaindia began the argument with its partners in the Basque government.

The Basque Country needs restful political consensus and then a restorative sense of common political purpose like an all night reveller needs 12 hours sleep and a strong pick me up. Unfortunately it has neither such balms. Politics in the Basque Country are criss crossed by demarcation lines that have historically fractured the area's political framework and created a plethora of tribal groupings.

A coalition of Basque nationalists and Socialists that has governed the fractious Basque region since 1986 appeared headed for another term, based on early returns from regional elections Sunday. There were no reports of violence, in contrast to three previous Basque regional elections since the region was given home rule in 1980. An exit poll made public by Spanish National Radio and Television immediately after the polls closed at 8 p.m. gave the Basque Nationalist Party about 25 percent of the vote, making it the strongest single political group.

The radical Basque party Herri Batasuna, considered to be the political arm of the terrorist group ETA, was projected to remain the third political force in the Basque country with 17 percent of the vote and 12 to 14 seats.

It embraces wholly obsolete industrial plants and greenfield sites devoted to technological innovation. It has been hit harder by recession than anywhere else in Spain and yet it is the home of an energetic business community and the headquarters of top national corporations.

He implies that the day when he will take power as head of a centre right Partido Popular (PP) government is at hand.

SPAIN'S TWO big governing regional parties, the Basque PNV and the Catalan CiU, have both issued a serious threat to the central authority of Madrid before the June 6 election by announcing plans to set up public banks which could increase the financial autonomy of the two regions. The move, started by the Basques and quickly followed by the Catalans, is a taste of the complex political dilemma that could confront either of Spain's two main parties, the governing Socialists or the conservative Partido Popular (PP), after the election. These parties are neck and neck in the polls, which predict a hung parliament in which any government would have to have the assistance of the Basque and Catalan parties.

What sets the Basque Country apart from any other corner of the European Union except Northern Ireland is that it has a terrorist problem. Eta, an acronym for Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, Basque fatherland and liberty, has been shooting, bombing and kidnapping for the better part of 25 years and is directly responsible for more than 800 deaths. Political violence in the Basque Country is on a lesser scale than it is in Northern Ireland and there are no troops patrolling the streets of Bilbao in order to keep warring terrorists, as in Belfast, apart from each other.

No clear majority emerged yesterday in regional elections in Spain's Basque region where Madrid based parties made strong gains at the expense of local nationalist parties. With 99 per cent of votes counted the governing Basque Nationalist party (PNV), the mainstream nationalist party, had equalled its former standing by taking 22 seats. However the Basque Socialist party (PSE), its junior coalition partner in the Basque government, fell from 16 seats to 12, and it appeared their combined total of seats would fall short of an overall majority in the 75 member Basque parliament.

Arzalluz made these statements in Barcelona at the conclusion of the meeting of the PNV and Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC) Executive Committees, at which the two Christian Democratic parties decided to demand of the government that it drop its centralist criteria in European building and allow the presence of representatives of the Catalan and Basque governments in Community institutions. Arzalluz showed himself optimistic, albeit with reservations, when referring to the negotiation with the Socialists on the pending transfers [of areas of responsibility] to the Basque Country, and so asked Felipe Gonzalez to continue contacts in order to find a political solution.

The detention of EGIN's editor in chief is linked to the open operation against ETA following the downfall last Thursday of the leader of the Barcelona commando and a former member of Herri Batasuna's national board, Felipe San Epifiano, known as Pipe.

The longer the craft stays in the water the weaker the binding becomes and the cans begin to move ominously. Although bound by the 1978 Constitution, the 17 autonomous regions that make up modern Spain are beginning to jostle about, rubbing up against each other and pressing the central government for more autonomy.

This is even beginning now in Aragon and while Basque separatists regularly take about 16 per cent of the Basque vote there has been a sharp increase in support recently for the separatist Catalan party ERC.

Attempts by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to regain the political initiative have suffered a significant setback in regional elections in the Basque country, where conservatives and communists made strong gains at the expense of his Socialist party. The Basque elections on Sunday were won, as expected, by the mainstream nationalist party, the Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV), which regained the 22 seats it had held in the outgoing 75 member regional parliament. But despite an active campaign by Mr Gonzalez, the Socialist party, which had been the junior coalition partner in the PNV led Basque government, lost four of its 16 seats in the local legislature, its worst electoral result in the region.

In December, Promocion Social de Viviendas, a housing cooperative run by the Union General de Trabajadores (UGT) [General Workers Union], the big socialist trade union confederation, collapsed; and this was followed by the near collapse of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), Spain's fourth largest bank, leading to the dismissal of its board by the Bank of Spain and the appointment of a new team. On January 27, the UGT and the Comisiones Obreras [Workers Commissions], the other main union confederation, called a one day general strike in protest against the new employment legislation. The strike slowed Spain down for a day, but it is not expected to deter the government from its reform policies.

Eta received a setback in general elections this month when its political front organisation, Herri Batasuna, lost two of the four seats it had held in parliament. The group could have been seeking to put pressure on the Basque Nationalist party, PNV the main political group in the northern Basque region, which is this week considering an invitation issued by prime minister Felipe Gonzalez to join a coalition government.

Another blew up Friday in an apartment in the Basque town of Irun, injuring a high school gym teacher who lost part of one arm and the fingers of a hand. Authorities defused three package bombs sent to government and military officials on Monday and Tuesday.

MR Jordi Pujol, leader of the Catalan nationalists, and Mr Xavier Arzallus, leader of the Basque nationalists, are likely to get the electoral result later this year that they have been waiting for ever since democracy was reintroduced to post Franco Spain. The prospect of a hung parliament converts their regionally based minority parties into powerbrokers. Polls suggest that the governing Socialist party will do well to hold 160 seats in congress, 15 short of an overall majority, when general elec tions are held in five or six months' time.

The Basque separatist group ETA claimed responsibility today for the bombing deaths last week of a Basque policeman and a paramilitary Civil Guard. In a statement sent to local papers, ETA said it had planted a bomb that exploded in a train tunnel early Sunday in Legazpi, near the Basque city of San Sebastian, instantly killing Jose Juan Pacheco Cano, 26. Pacheco Cano, a member of the autonomous Basque region's police unit, the Ertzantza, had joined in a search for bombs after a local travel bureau received a warning that explosives had been planted in the area.

The Herri Batasuna or Popular Union party, widely considered the political arm of the Basque nationalist terrorist group ETA, finished with 13 seats, the same number it had already held.

BFN <F P=106> [Article by Victor Cardoso] </F> [Text] Jon Imanol Azua Mendia, government vice president of the autonomous Basque country, confirmed that no known member of the separatist organization ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] is in Mexico; that there is no known link with local subversive groups; and that the Mexican Government has never asked for special advisers to combat terrorist activities. In a news conference at the conclusion of his eight day official visit to Mexico, the representative of the Basque Government stated there is no information, proof, or indication that the ETA had anything to do with the events that shook Mexico this year. If any known member of the ETA were in Mexico, he would have been identified and completely controlled.

Thousands marched in a cold, heavy rain through the center of this restive northern city Saturday, demanding the government open talks with the Basque separatist group ETA. The march, which authorities said drew an estimated 18,000 people, was organized by the radical Basque nationalist party Herri Batasuna, widely considered the political arm of ETA. ETA has claimed responsibility for more than 600 deaths since 1968, when it began fighting for independence for the three province northern Basque region.

A gunman killed a restaurant worker today as he served coffee to customers, and police blamed the attack on Basque separatists. The gunman fled in a car after shooting Jose Luis Barrios in the San Jorge Restaurant, police said. The 34 year old, whose father owns the restaurant, was the only person hurt in the attack at 1 a.m. An anonymous caller who said he spoke for the Basque separatist organization ETA told a traveler's bureau in Santurce that a man whose car had been stolen was tied to a tree in the nearby town of Baracaldo.

[Ardanza] My party has not changed its line, but after seven years in which not a single statutory transfer [to the regional autonomous government] was implemented, we are really tired of waiting, and we find it intolerable that the socialist party continues tinkering endlessly with obligatory, mandated legislation such as the Statute of Guernica, which was endorsed in a referendum.

Cheaper energy in France has prompted a leading steel company in Spain's Basque country to cross the frontier and invest Pta11.2bn (Pounds 55m) in a new plant in Bayonne. The decision by the family owned Marcial Ucn group, which makes rods and long bars for the construction industry, adds a new dimension to Spanish fears about falling competitiveness. These concerns were fuelled earlier this year by the relocation plans of the loss making Spanish subsidiaries of Gillette, the US consumer products multinational, and of Suzuki, the Japanese vehicle maker.
