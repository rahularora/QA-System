Maine lobstermen are laying three times as much bait and scientists have even tried raising lobster larvae in test tanks, but the harvest of the tasty crustaceans hasn't increased in 20 years. Marine biologists from the University of Maine and Bigelow Laboratory in West Boothbay are conducting a 10 day research cruise next month, and hope their detailed probe of breeding grounds will help explain the inability of lobstermen to increase the annual catch. The lobstermen, some of whom have volunteered to assist biologists as they map the ocean floor, are hoping the investigation will lead to bigger catches.

The limiting factor could be the amount of suitable habitat the lobsters can live in, the amount of food available for the creatures, or the ecological balance of lobsters and their predators, Dow said.

A man who is in hot water after being caught with an oversize lobster says Herb was a pet and Marine Patrol officers went too far when they seized the 10 pound crustacean and made two boys cry. James Benenson, a New Yorker and summer resident of this Down East town, said Friday he would not mind paying the $71.50 fine for lobster fishing without a license. But he pleaded innocent at arraignment Thursday.

Maine lobstermen are considered an independent and cantankerous breed, and most attempts at intervention in their industry are about as welcome as an empty lobster trap. The latest try is no exception though it began as a bid to improve lobster traps. Instead, it's resulted in traps that let lobsters get away, lobstermen complain.

Lobstermen are feuding again in the rich lobster fishing areas of Casco Bay, and in one dispute two fishermen were tossed in the harbor, a gun was brandished and a boat damaged. It's a territorial dispute, Maine Marine Patrol Lt. Joseph Fessenden said Tuesday. It's a situation where there's a limited area of space to fish.

It would be a faux pas to say, You poor fishermen can't fish.

Bud Breault Jr. acknowledged that more lobster traps will be destroyed with the new security zone, and it may be difficult for the lobstermen to prove who did it if they try to file a claim. This will have an impact on you and probably your lobster pots, Breault told the angry lobstermen in a special meeting. Some lobstermen said they will refuse to work the waters off Bush's property because they don't want government officials boarding their boats.

In life and death, thousands of pounds of Atlantic herring have been eating up the oxygen in Block Island's Old Harbor and stinking up the local lobster industry. Local officials Wednesday sought state help for lobstermen who lost an undetermined amount of catch when the herring depleted the small harbor's oxygen supply. About 10 15 commercial lobstermen operate from the harbor.

An international panel is to decide in April whether an American law banning the import of undersized lobsters violates the Free Trade Agreement between the United States and Canada. The panel, which was scheduled to hear arguments on the dispute today, is to recommend a resolution in mid May that could range from leaving the law as it is to banning it altogether. The board of three Americans and two Canadians could also call for a compromise.

When a lobster is showered with the invisible but harmless beam, the tag number is recorded and displayed on a monitor.

The 25 pounder, equipped with claws the size of baseball mitts, arrived from Boston on March 25 after an order got mixed up at Hill's Main Line Seafood Co. in Ardmore. When owner Kevin Hill recovered from his astonishment, he and his staff dubbed her Shirley. Then he sold her and the other hefty crustacean to a regular customer, a retired carpenter from Haverford, for $287.

It was a good year for the company that makes paper for U.S. currency, and that means more folding money for its workers. Crane &amp; Co. officials said Tuesday it would contribute a record $4.5 million to a profit sharing plan for 1,100 employees at three plants in western Massachusetts. The payments amount to between 16 percent and 20 percent of the annual salaries of workers, who make $6 to $12 an hour, officials said.

A monster lobster, weighing 35 pounds and believed to be 140 years old, made a big splash at a display in downtown Boston this weekend. The lobster was caught Thursday off the coast of New Bedford when it was dragged in with a load of scallops, said Heather Robertson, spokeswoman for The Boston and Maine Fish Co., which bought the creature. At about 3 foot long, the lobster is believed to be one of the largest and oldest ever captured off the Bay State coast.

Almost 100 Vietnamese fishermen in Boston Harbor, all former boat people, say they face the loss of their livelihood this week because of new restrictions on their gill net fishing methods. But the lobstermen who lobbied the state to enact the new rules say that it was their livelihood that was threatened by the fishing method used by the Vietnamese. The dispute has led to tension between the two sides, including one incident in which a lobsterman brandished gun at a Vietnamese fisherman, the Vietnamese said.

President Bush signed legislation Tuesday banning the import of undersized lobsters. The bill was backed by New England lawmakers who presented it both as a conservation measure and as a way to protect U.S. fishermen against Canadian competitors harvesting smaller lobsters. The lobster provision is contained in the $400 million authorization bill for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Up to now, U.S. law has not regulated the size of imported lobsters. In coming years, U.S. regulations would gradually increase the minimum size of a lobster that could be caught in U.S. waters. Because Canada would not be bound by the increased minimum size regulation, its fishermen could continue to deplete the harvest and compete unfairly with their U.S. counterparts, lobster fishermen argued.

DEVON fishermen angling to keep crab and lobster bait free of value added tax have landed a resounding victory against HM Customs and Excise thanks to the sophisticated palates of shellfish. After an intensive 15 month campaign, Customs has agreed that fresh fish used to catch shellfish will not be liable for VAT as long as they are fit for human consumption. Maggots, lugworms and other bait used by anglers will retain the 17.5 per cent levy.

Maggots, lugworms and other bait used by anglers will retain the 17.5 per cent levy. At the heart of the case is the fact that crabs and lobsters are highly discriminating creatures which will not eat anything that humans will not eat.

Animal rights activists on Friday spent $240 to buy seven live lobsters from a suburban Maryland restaurant and fly them to a new home off the coast of Maine. Cam McQueen of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals picked up the lobsters from the House of Chinese Gourmet in Rockville, Md., about 10 a.m., took them to Washington National Airport and boarded a flight to Portland, Maine, a PETA official said. Members of the U.S. Coast Guard then were expected to escort her and the lobsters to a boat station to release the creatures into their new ocean home, PETA spokeswoman Victoria Thomas said.
