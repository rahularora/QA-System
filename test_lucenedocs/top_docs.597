Immediately after its release, newspaper editorials, legislators and farmers decried the novel as a distorted portrait of migrant life. The book was burned in several cities, including Salinas, Calif., Steinbeck's hometown, and was banned in many libraries and schools. Eleanor Roosevelt defended the book in her weekly column, and in 1940 a congressional committee held hearings in Oklahoma to find out whether the squalid conditions and brutal treatment of the workers recounted in the novel were accurate.

Driving in from O'Hare for the world premiere of the Steppenwolf Theatre Company's dramatization of The Grapes of Wrath, I passed a wall sized graffito advising Chicago's wretched that IT IS RIGHT TO REBEL. The sign struck me as an apt summary of John Steinbeck's ardent chronicle of the Okie migration to California during the Dust Bowl years, and I arrived at the Royal George Theatre ready for a rousing polemic on behalf of the dispossessed, an American style Les Miserables. The parallels are hard to miss: two huge novels, based in historical fact, about the social cost of institutionalized callousness, turned into sprawling stage shows.

What other critics said: Frank Rich, The New York Times: The production at the Cort, an epic achievement for the director, Frank Galati, and the Chicago theater ensemble at his disposal, makes Steinbeck live for a new generation not by updating his book but by digging into its timeless heart. Howard Kissel, the Daily News: There is something heartening about seeing such a large, deeply committed company engaged in serious work, but what they achieve is something far below Steinbeck's galvanizing vision. Clive Barnes, the New York Post: This is, overall, a thrilling theatrical achievement that gets its power from the still sharp relevance of its human message ... and its entertainment quality from the performance by an ensemble you should walk miles to see.

JOHN STEINBECK: A BIOGRAPHY by Jay Parini Heinemann, Pounds 20, 614 pages Is it still true, as I suppose, that most people love reading John Steinbeck in their teens, yet only rarely return to him in their maturity? Was his friend John Hersey right when, explaining Steinbeck's astronomical sales, he said, 'Readers loved him. Even people who really did read books read Steinbeck'?

He establishes the structure with confident authority: the family homes in Salinas and Monterey; the unsatisfactory parents who nevertheless supported their son while he mastered his trade; the failure at Stanford; the early experience on the road, as labourer, rancher, sailor, solitary; the three wives, the alcohol and the depressions; the unfailing conviction of his vocation as writer; and then the breakthrough to worldwide success with Tortilla Flat, followed by Of Mice and Men and, in 1939,The Grapes of Wrath.

Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater Company received mostly warm reviews from London critics Friday following the European debut of its stage version of John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. Jack Tinker in The Daily Mail called the play, adapted from Steinbeck's Depression era, Pulitzer Prize winning novel, as shatteringly a perfect piece of American theater as you are likely to experience in a lifetime of trans Atlantic travel. Claire Armitstead in The Financial Times found the show a magnificent ensemble piece ... richly and simply evocative.

Emotionally stark, visually bleak and aurally sustaining (composer and musical director Michael Smith has created a mood setting musical frame performed on harmonica, a musical harp, banjo, fiddle and guitar), this lament for the destitute farmers who left Oklahoma's Dust Bowl in the '30s in search of work and survival in California has profound resonances in the present. The Okies were the first homeless. </P> <P> The echoes, however, run even deeper backward as well as forward.

The Grapes of Wrath, winner of the 1990 Tony Award as best play, will close Labor Day weekend after a Broadway run of less than six months, a show spokeswoman said Tuesday.

There was more drama off camera than on at the 1990 Tony Awards, although The Grapes of Wrath was the upset winner for best play over The Piano Lesson.

Unlike the 1989 awards when two categories best book of a musical and best score were eliminated, this year's competition will have a full complement of 19 categories. One category, choreography, was whittled down to three nominees instead of the usual four because of a scarcity of competition. Last year, Tony suspense was minimal with only three shows in the best musical competition Starmites, which quickly folded, and two revues, Black and Blue and Jerome Robbins' Broadway.
