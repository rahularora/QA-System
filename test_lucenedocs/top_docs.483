A major Japanese rice wine brewer plans to set up a factory in Colorado that will use pure Rocky Mountain water to make traditional Japanese sake, the company said Thursday. Tatsuuma Honke Brewing Co., a sake brewer based in western Japan, will build its $7 million factory in Golden, Colo., on land bought from Adolph Coors Co., a major U.S. brewer, said Tetsuya Ogura, Tatsuuma Honke spokesman. Dry air, cool weather and abundant, pure water from the Rocky Mountains, as well as cheap rice, are factors that led the company to set up a brewery in Colorado, Ogura said.

Constrution of the factory is to start next April. It is expected to produce 200,000 bottles of rice wine a year beginning in March 1991, with output increasing to 500,000 bottles in the third year of production.

A Japanese company's decision to build a sake plant near here is a sign that Colorado is becoming well known in Japan, a state economic development official says. I think there's a growing awareness of Colorado in the minds of the Japanese citizens, said Susan Blansett, who is a business development representative for the state's Office of Economic Development. Colorado is gaining a favorable image.

Conventional wisdom says one rotten apple spoils the bunch. Epitope Inc. has a plan to keep that apple from going bad in the first place. The small Beaverton, Ore., biotechnology concern said it entered a year long research agreement with Sakata Seed Corp. of Japan to determine whether it can control the ripening of vegetables, fruits and flowers using genetic engineering techniques.

Of the American groups, Budweiser has linked with Suntory, Coors with Asahi and Miller with Sapporo, while Heineken of the Netherlands has been working with Kirin. In the past four years, both imports and foreign beers brewed under licence locally have increased their share of a growing market, although they still have only 2.3 per cent, compared with about 5 per cent held by imports in other beer drinking countries. 'This is an immature beer market,' says Heineken's Enters.

Anheuser took its gripe public after Coors announced on Tuesday its plans to buy a Memphis, Tenn., brewery from Stroh Brewery Co. We wonder how that company can maintain its Rocky Mountain identity' while brewing in Memphis, said Michael J. Roarty, executive vice president of corporate marketing at Anheuser Busch. Mr. Roarty said that the Coors campaign implies that its beers are brewed using only Colorado water. But Coors actually makes some beer in a packaging facility in Virginia by mixing local water with beer concentrate, according to Mr. Roarty.

At the most powerful of all power lunches, the monthly gathering of the 29 Mitsubishi group heads, the fare is often humble 'curry rice', a gently spiced, dun coloured dish which is also the staple of the average office worker in a hurry. The Kinyokai, as the Mitsubishi meal is called, reflects the general restraint exercised by the Japanese executive at lunchtime, when few deals are done and the emphasis is on quick and sober consumption. Such modest daytime habits are a source of frustration for those foreign competitors who hope that luxury and decadence will undermine the Japanese work ethic.

We think it's here to stay, Eiler said. Although it's just started to catch the public's fancy, dry beer is not new. Regional beers in the 1950s and '60s, such as Rheingold and Stag Pale Dry, were touted for dry taste, but they never caused a big a stir in the industry like the current craze, which got started about two years ago in Japan.

JAPAN has informally floated a proposal to lift its ban on rice imports after a six year moratorium period to 1999, according to trade negotiators in Tokyo and Geneva. In a second initiative late yesterday in Geneva, Japan is also offering to harmonise at low levels its tariffs on non ferrous metals, and cut by at least 50 per cent its tariff peaks on a further 150 textile items. A US trade negotiator described the initiative, unveiled during a full meeting of Uruguay round participants aimed at taking stock of progress in negotiations, as 'an additional concrete step' towards successful completion of the Uruguay round of world trade talks.

Just days after Fujitsu Ltd. failed in its attempt to escape a contract for which it bid 1 yen, or about 0.7 of a U.S. cent, the Japanese computer giant said it was trying to withdraw from another 1 yen deal it says lacks common sense. Akira Imagawa, a spokesman at Fujitsu's headquarters in Tokyo, said Wednesday that company officials in the Nagano prefecture in central Japan had asked local authorities to cancel a contract the company won last month with a 1 yen bid. Both cases have attracted the attention of Japan's Fair Trade Commission, whose officials say they are considering an investigation into whether the unusually low bids constitute unfair trade under the Anti Monopoly Law.

For those who have given up looking for work, the day begins with glasses of beer or sake at one of the many sake stands. Some stand around a meal van eating curry with rice for Y120, a fraction of the price for a businessman's meal in Tokyo. The heady days of the late 1980s and the acute labour shortage created high demand for the day labourers, increasing daily wages to as high as Y13,000 for clearing and digging land.

The Henokians meet annually to discuss issues affecting the family company and have links with organisations such as the Tercentenarians' Club**, a UK group of 300 year old companies. British family businesses such as R. Durtnell &amp; Sons, a Kent building company founded in 1591, and Folkes Group (1699), a Stourbridge based open die forging company, would probably qualify for membership. In the UK, at least, the significance of family companies has been largely ignored, although the Confederation of British Industry and Stoy Hayward, an accountancy firm, have established a family business forum.

Their key brands are doing well, said Emanuel Goldman, analyst for PaineWebber Inc., San Francisco. It's not clear to me that Coors needs a corporate campaign. But by starting out in only four markets Fresno and Sacramento, Calif., Erie, Penn., and Rochester, N.Y. Coors isn't gambling a lot of money on the venture, Mr. Goldman pointed out.

<P> The title of the poetic, compelling fable Demons in Spring (at the Little Tokyo Cinemas) refers to the white crests of waves caused by the collision of warm and cold currents in the sea off Sanriku, the northernmost district of Japan's main island of Honshu. In ancient times, the people of Sanriku believed that every spring the breakers carried with them a demon. </P> <P> For more than 25 years, actor turned director Akira Kobayashi has wanted to film the Tokuhei Suchi novel inspired by this legend.

The product goes on sale this week in Colorado, Arizona and Northern California cities mainly in the San Francisco area, Coors spokesman Heidi Buehler Nogues said.

Four o'clock on a July morning on the rim of a dormant volcano. It was dark and chilly, the wind swirling out of the 700 ft crater behind me. I was not alone, just one of hundreds gathering on the summit of Mt Fuji, at 12,388ft the highest point in Japan.

At this altitude it is necessary to rest every few steps as the final few hundred feet are the steepest and the loose volcanic ash and clinker make it very tiring: three trudges up, half a slide down, wheeze, rest, gulp for oxygen, gaze at the stars.
