A mysterious murder film turned out to be no mystery at all when police discovered the evidence was really a rock music video. The film, found in a movie camera lying in a Michigan cornfield last year, shows Trent Reznor, lead singer for the Cleveland rock group Nine Inch Nails, lying face up in an ally on Chicago's North Side. Chicago police Detective Hal Ardell said Tuesday the rock group made the film last September using 8mm movie cameras held aloft with helium balloons for some of the scenes.

Someone apparently bent on taking the wind out of a police crackdown on speeders has been puncturing tires on patrol cars and motorcycles by sprinkling the officers' highway hideaways with roofing nails. Since May, more than 40 tires on patrol cars and motorcycles have been flattened by the roofing nails, authorities said Wednesday. After it happened more than once, Westminster police figured they were targets of booby traps placed by someone who knew just where officers would park while looking for speeders.
