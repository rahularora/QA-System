Darkman With little fanfare and none of the intrusive hype that heralded Batman and Dick Tracy, a tidy comic book fantasy thriller from Universal Pictures will fill screens across the nation on Aug. 24, and if you're smart, you'll get in line right now. At a fraction of the budget, Darkman is what Dick Tracy could have been without turning over the movie to the non talents of Madonna and ignoring plot and action, or what Batman should have been without all the pretense and Joker mania. It's a simple story of good vs. evil, seen through the talented lens of Bill Pope, with sure fire direction from Sam Raimi ( The Evil Dead ) and the kind of special effects you only visualize in action comic books.

Premiering tonight on Ted Turner's TNT cable network, Heat Wave is partly based on what scriptwriter Michael Lazlou says was Richardson's true story, sporadically told from Richardson's point of view in voice overs.

It is the most serious misuse of film craft in the history of filmmaking, the Rev. Lloyd John Ogilvie, senior pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, said at a news conference attended by four other prominent area Christians.

Long lines of curious filmgoers turned out to see The Last Temptation of Christ in nine cities, greatly outnumbering the protesters who denounced as sacrilegious the film that debuted in guarded theaters. Many movie patrons left sold out theaters Friday wondering what all the fuss was about, while others said protesters were trying to suppress free speech and religious toleration. It's just a movie, and you can't really condone it or say anything about it until you've seen it, said James Aguiar, 23, one of hundreds of patrons who lined up around the block at New York's Ziegfeld Theater.

Jodie Foster, who had the thrill and disappointment of an unsuccessful Academy Award nomination 13 years ago, won the best actress Oscar Wednesday night for her portrayal of a rape victim in The Accused. This is such a big deal and my life is so simple, the ebullient 26 year old actress told the Shrine Auditorium audience as she clutched the glistening trophy. There are very few things there is love and work and family and this movie was so special to us because it was all three of those things, she said.

About 25,000 demonstrators, some lugging crosses, urged mass boycotts of The Last Temptation of Christ upon its release today, and at least one major theater chain has decided against showing the film. The movie opens in nine major cities at the height of a nationwide fundamentalist furor sparked by Christians who say it is blasphemous in its portrayal of a Jesus Christ tempted to abandon his divinity. In New York City today, about two dozen demonstrators picketed in front of the Ziegfeld Theater, some shouting at the hundreds of film goers who formed a line that wrapped around the block for a matinee showing.

I don't know when Mr. Kureishi began to write his first novel The Buddha of Suburbia (Viking, 284 pages, $18.95) but it is set in the 1970s and reads as though it was an early treatment of his experiences as a young man of non English heritage growing up in Kent outside London. Perhaps it was put aside in favor of the 1985 Laundrette and 1987 Sammy and Rosie. The novel covers the same terrain of racism, class tensions and sex, but in more overtly autobiographical, coming of age style.

The novel's funniest moment comes when the now regretful father, infuriated by Changez, attacks him with a cane and Changez defends himself with a just purchased sex aid. The father is hospitalized; Karim and Jamila dub Changez, in the manner of his favorite fiction, The Dildo Killer. Mr. Kureishi's films are funny, charming and (mildly) shocking by turns.
