The buyer, East Sussex County Council, pledged Thursday to allow continued public access to the forest, which was badly damaged in the October 1987 hurricane.

ABC shows won two of 20 citations from Action for Children's Television, an advocacy group that honored children's shows for creative excellence. ACT, in keeping with its theme of using television to encourage children to read, gave its Stop, Look &amp; Listen award to Daddy Can't Read, an ABC Afterschool special that confronted adult illiteracy in a solution oriented story for children and families, the 10,000 member organization said. Creative excellence in children's TV is still the exception to the rule of mediocrity, said Peggy Charren, who founded the organization in 1968.

as in life the best ideas are often the simplest ones, striking the reader with the force of inevitability. The First Christmas (Frances Lincoln, Pounds 9.99) falls into this category, a picture book for the very young which brings together some of the great biblical paintings of the Renaissance from London's National Gallery and carefully chosen texts from the authorised version of the Old and New Testaments. It is a marvellous way of introducing great art and the Christmas story to young children.

British Petroleum has dropped its bid to drill for oil next to a southern English forest where A.A. Milne conjured up the immortal Winnie the Pooh more than 60 years ago, the Osberver newspaper reported Sunday. It said the giant oil firm decided not to appeal the East Sussex County Council's refusal to grant a test drilling permit for the area near Ashdown Forest. Milne's son, Christopher Robin Milne, 67, was quoted as saying, however: There never can be a total victory while it is government policy to drill for oil regardless of what lies on the surface.

Britain's army of civil servants got new marching orders Wednesday: use plain English. Citing such authorities as Confucius and Winnie the Pooh, a Cabinet Office pamphlet appealed to the bureaucrats to be clear and concise in talking to the public and to each other. Britain's 500,000 member civil service has never been known for using a word when three would do, as the pamphlet notes in citing this 18th century note from the Commissioners of Excise to the Supervisor of Pontefract: I am ordered to acquaint you that if you hereafter continue that affected and schoolboy way of writing, and to murder the language in such a manner, you will be discharged for a fool.

And the Disney MGM Studios tour outside Orlando puts the granddaddy of amusement park companies at the forefront of the latest trend in fun factories by taking customers backstage to play at movie making. It's the new Disney one that repulsed a raid on the Magic Kingdom of the business world five years ago, revved up a plan to make movies for older audiences and devised new ways to wring billions out of a familiar lineup of animated characters and amusement parks.

Showing this once or twice isn't really going to change anybody's mind who's going to use drugs, he said.

John Conyers Jr. (D Mich.). </P> <P> Showing this once or twice isn't really going to change anybody's mind who's going to use drugs, he said.

To many adults, at least, the goofy, purple and green Barney doesn't have the charm of the Little Mermaid, or the humor of a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. But he sold more than 300,000 kids' videos last year and claims a fan club of 56,000 preschoolers. Today, he is featured in special boutiques in Neiman Marcus stores, and is headed for a nationwide Christmas promotion at J.C. Penney Co.; toy makers and others clamor to lease rights to him, and he's about to get his own television series.

<P> ABC will pick up two awards today when Action for Children's Television hands out its 17th annual Achievement in Children's Television honors in Cambridge, Mass. Daddy Can't Read, an ABC Afterschool Special about adult illiteracy, and The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, part of the network's Saturday morning children's lineup, are among the 20 winners from broadcast TV, cable and home video. ACT president Peggy Charen notes that the winners demonstrate a concern for the TV needs of young audiences, but adds that creative excellence in children's TV is still the exception to the rule of mediocrity.
