Cable News Network today said it is considering an evening newscast to compete directly with the big three TV networks. The idea under consideration calls for a newscast at 6 p.m. or 6:30 p.m. EDT to go head to head with the networks, and CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw could have a role on the program, CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said. But he said CNN officials haven't made a final determination of whether a frontal assault on Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather would be a good idea.

The proposal calls for a half hour, stand alone newscast, unlike CNN's virtually 24 hour, all news format, in which the news is continuously updated.

Cable News Network, which went after the big three TV networks in 1980 with round the clock news, is preparing a frontal assault with an hour long newscast premiering next month. CNN spokesman Steve Haworth announced Tuesday the newscast will be shown from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. EDT, possibly with CNN anchor Bernard Shaw. But Haworth said, We have no decision on talent yet.

The ratings still begin with a decimal point, but Cable News Network is standing by its fledgling dinner time newscast, The World Today. CNN launched the one hour program in October, starting it at 6 p.m. EST, a time slot in which its second half hour competes directly with the nightly newscasts of ABC, CBS and NBC in the Eastern and Central time zones, where 75 percent of the nation's viewers live. CNN's new show gained some immediate attention with the selection of Catherine Crier, up until last year a Texas judge, to join veteran newsman Bernard Shaw at the anchor desk Crier in Atlanta, Shaw in Washington.

Cable News Network, the 24 hour all news cable network, is preparing to launch an evening newscast next month, the first time it has scheduled a news program in competition with the three broadcast networks, according to people at CNN. And in an unorthodox move, the Turner Broadcasting System Inc. unit said it hired Catherine Crier, a state district judge from Dallas with no television or journalistic experience, to be a correspondent and anchor. Although CNN didn't specify which program she would be assigned to, the CNN sources said she may co anchor the new broadcast.

Weary network crews trudged home today after following their anchormen from Czechoslovakia to Rome to Malta, where they covered a summit whose storms threatened to upstage the superpowers. At one point Saturday night, CBS anchor Dan Rather warned that if the weather doesn't improve, this thing's going to be a wreck. But from the TV standpoint, the only thing wrecked at the summit was a small studio CNN had built near Marsaxlokk Bay, overlooking the harbor site of the shipboard meetings of President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

Because the network's newscasts are carried live in each time zone, the program would air as early as 3 p.m. on the West Coast. Currently, CNN runs Newswatch from 5 6:30 p.m. EDT and shows the entertainment news program Show Biz Today at 6:30 p.m. CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said the new plan calls for Show Biz Today to air at 5:30 p.m. EDT and Newswatch to run from 5 5:30 p.m. EDT. Haworth said speculation that Texas District Judge Catherine Crier, hired Monday by CNN for a newscasting job, would co anchor the new program was premature.

Catherine Crier, a former Texas judge with no news experience, and Bernard Shaw, who has 25 years in broadcast news, became TV's newest anchor team Monday with CNN's new The World Today. Crier, who never worked in news until she reported for work two weeks ago at Cable News Network, made only three slight verbal flubs and wasn't visibily nervous in her debut on camera and on the one hour weeknight series. Crier was in CNN headquarters in Atlanta, while Shaw, with CNN since its creation in 1979, was in Washington.

CBS and NBC coverage Saturday of the meeting between President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev wasn't much affected, despite heavy wind and stormy seas that ended plans for afternoon and dinner meetings that day. But the day's 60 mph wind destroyed a studio set CNN had built near Marsaxlokk Bay, overlooking the harbor site of the shipboard summit, and also blew down and damaged a CNN satellite dish.

CBS and NBC coverage Saturday of the meeting between President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev wasn't much affected, despite heavy wind and stormy seas that ended plans for afternoon and dinner meetings that day. But the day's 60 mph wind destroyed a studio set CNN had built near Marsaxlokk Bay, overlooking the harbor site of the shipboard summit, and also blew down and damaged a CNN satellite dish. That knocked out CNN's TV signal for eight hours, starting at 9 p.m. EST, although a network spokesman in Malta said most of the TV blackout occurred when little was going on and no transmissions were planned.

Round the clock news coverage gave CNN a number of firsts: President Reagan walking into a Washington, D.C., hospital after being shot; a split screen of the hostages being released in Iran as Reagan was sworn into office, and a lonely cameraman perched atop a cherry picker with the only live feed of a nuclear warhead being removed after an Air Force explosion in Arkansas.

They're trying hard to set it up, he says. Obviously that takes a little more effort, but that's what they're trying to do.

Elsewhere In Television: CAN WE TALK BICOASTAL? Pleased by the ratings for the The Joan Rivers Show when it originated from Los Angeles last month, Tribune Entertainment, which syndicates her New York based weekday series, is thinking of having it air from Los Angeles for three months each year. Should this come to pass, says a spokesman for Rivers' show, it would make her program the nation's first bicoastal talk show in syndication.

ABC's Peter Jennings was longing to be in China last week like competitor Dan Rather of CBS, but he's looking ahead now to taking World News Tonight to Europe next week, and anchoring a prime time news special on Thursday to set it all up. Jennings will report from Brussels and London from May 29 to June 2 as President Bush meets with leaders of NATO allies. Unless something unusual happens, though, the story in Western Europe won't be as exciting as the one that CBS' Rather found himself in the middle of last week.

Televison networks all sent dozens of staffers to cover the Northern California earthquake, but sheer numbers couldn't always overcome the enormous difficulties the story presented. Even with million dollar anchors and squadrons of correspondents, technicians and producers, the three broadcast networks and CNN quickly learned it's a grind to deliver compelling, competitive reports in conditions where rumor and misinformation have flowed like water. ABC anchor Peter Jennings arrived at destroyed Interstate 880 on Wednesday morning and, minutes later, delivered a live dispatch that demonstrated the hazards of capturing the story both quickly and accurately.
