Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN [Text] Nagoya, March 15 KYODO Nitrogen oxides and ozone from the Asian Continent are contributing to air pollution over the western Pacific, researchers at Nagoya University said Tuesday [15 March]. The researchers, led by Yutaka Kondo, professor at the university's solar terrestrial environmental laboratory, used data from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) survey of chemical substances in the atmosphere. The pollutants are carried from the Asian mainland to the Pacific by prevailing westerly winds, the researchers said.

Low altitude ozone results from a chemical change in atmospheric oxygen, with nitrogen oxides from automobile exhausts and coal fired power stations serving as catalysts. Unlike stratospheric ozone, such low altitude ozone can damage the respiratory system when in high densities. The density of ozone in clean air is normally about 20 parts per billion (PPB) and that of nitrogen oxide is around 0.1 PPB.

Unlike stratospheric ozone, such low altitude ozone can damage the respiratory system when in high densities. The density of ozone in clean air is normally about 20 parts per billion (PPB) and that of nitrogen oxide is around 0.1 PPB. But at altitudes of 2,000 to 3000 meters off the coasts near Taiwan and Hong Kong, ozone densities were more than 100 PPB, and off Japan, nitrogen oxide densities were 1 PPB.

A member of the research team, Hideaki Nakajima, said the pollutants detected are responsible for acid rain and could eventually cause forests near the Pacific to die off unless countries in the region quickly produce a preventive strategy. China and Russia, with their relatively low environmental standards, have previously been identified as responsible for much of the pollution in the region, but this is the first empirical evidence to back up the claims.

Scientists at a Sandia National Laboratories facility said they have developed a promising new process for eliminating a major pollutant from the exhaust of combustion systems. The process, which is still in the early development stage, has the potential to almost eliminate nitrogen oxides a major part of smog from sources such as diesel vehicles and coal burning generating plants, the researchers said. If the process should become commercially applicable, it could greatly benefit the fight against acid rain and air pollution.

Congress should require 90 percent reductions in air pollution by nitrogen compounds, given off in power plant emissions and motor vehicle exhausts, the American Lung Association said Tuesday. Nitrogen oxides help form ozone, acid rain and the formation of airborne particles that hamper visibility. Some of nitrogen oxide compounds also contribute to the global warming embodied in the greenhouse effect theory while others may be more damaging to health than previously believed, the association said.

The United States signed a supplemental treaty Tuesday aimed at limiting emissions of nitrogen oxides, air pollutants that help cause acid rain and smog, the Environmental Protection Agency said. Administrator Lee M. Thomas signed the protocol to the existing treaty on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution in Sofia, Bulgaria, according to an agency announcement. The United States earlier declined to sign a similar protocol dealing with sulfur dioxide, requiring a 30 percent reduction in emissions, on the ground that U.S. sulfur dioxide emissions had been reduced substantially under the 1970 Clean Air Act.

Earlier negotiations resulted in international agreement in 1985 to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 30 percent, an agreement the United States has declined to join. Both sulfur and nitrogen oxides are emitted by coal burning power plants and factory boilers.

Mudd, principal engineer at the utility, says that in such a condition coal requires only half as much heat to burn as in conventional boilers, and so produces only half as much nitrogen oxide. A major drawback of these methods is that additional technologies are required to completely remove nitrogen oxides. Some technologies attempt to simultaneously remove both gases with catalysts, the same way catalytic converters render automobile emissions harmless.

House members who want stricter auto emissions standards say they won't let an initial defeat prevent another bid to toughen President Bush's clean air bill. Administration opponents on the Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee failed Tuesday to amend the bill, as they sought to make auto requirements far tougher than those in smog choked California. Panel Chairman Henry A. Waxman's plan lost on a voice vote, but the California Democrat said his forces would make another attempt possibly today, when the subcommittee considers more amendments to the administration plan.

Sir, I have no doubt that many of your chemically trained readers experienced the same delicious frisson as I when they read Clive Cookson's item 'Nitrous Acid gets last laugh' (April 10). Suffice it to say that intractable confusion between nitrous oxide (laughing gas) and nitrous acid (an entirely distinct compound known only in an aqueous solution) rendered the entire article largely meaningless. Nitrous and nitric acids are present as pollutants in atmospheric water droplets largely as a result of emissions of two other oxides of nitrogen (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) from petrol combustion and other chemical processes.

Acid rain's sewage from the sky is an important and unrecognized contributor to the death of marine life in East Coast estuaries and coastal waters, an environmental group said Monday. Nitrate compounds originating in the atmosphere, mostly as nitric acid, appear to contribute about 25 percent of total nitrogen flowing into Chesapeake Bay, said the Environmental Defense Fund in a report by staff scientists. Ammonium compounds from the atmosphere, mostly originating in the evaporation of manure, contribute another 14 percent of the bay's nitrogen load, the report said.

Air pollutants must be attacked in combination, not one by one, because that's the way they are helping to kill trees and stunt crops across the country, an environmental research group said Thursday. Policymakers risk worsening other pollution if they attack a single pollutant, said James MacKenzie and Mohammed El Ashry, the authors of a report for the World Resources Institute. For example, current strategies to reduce urban ozone could be increasing ozone in rural areas, said MacKenzie.

Dying trees in the East, primarily some pines in the Southeast and red spruce in the Appalachian Mountains, probably are being killed by the interaction of ozone and the sulfuric and nitric acids in acid rain, they said. Ozone in rural areas throughout the country appears to be roughly twice the normal background level, the study said.

Urban air cleanup programs are neglecting sources of pollution that might be killing trees in rural areas, according to an environmental researcher. By concentrating on efforts to limit emissions of hydrocarbons, rather than nitrogen oxides, the urban programs could be allowing nitric acids to form ozone in other areas, said James J. MacKenzie, one of the authors of a report released today by the World Resources Institute. An official of the Environmental Protection Agency, Gerald Emisson, said the agency's latest computer models showed no such result, at least for the Northeast.

It is because our air quality is so poor that I have such strong differences with the clean air legislation that President Bush sent to Congress last month. My criticisms of the administration proposal are based not on the very minor issues identified by the Journal, but on the fundamental inadequacy of the proposal to address these important public health problems. The legislation would repeal provisions protecting the national parks and other clean air areas from ozone and nitrogenoxide emissions.

Another ozone scare appears to be upon us, and it could be just as misleading as the one that led Congress to cancel the SST prototype in 1971. Following congressional testimony last month that dangerous melanoma skin cancers had increased 83% in the past seven years, press reports implied that the increase was the result of the destruction of ozone in the atmosphere, which allowed more ultraviolet radiation to reach Earth. The ozone supposedly was destroyed by widely used chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

President Bush is expected to propose legislation requiring a 10 million ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2000 to combat acid rain, administration and congressional sources said Friday. The new acid rain standards not quite as extensive as the 12 million ton cut sought by environmentalists but far more rigid than industry has wanted are expected to be a key component in a clean air package Bush will unveil on Monday. The sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also said that Bush's package likely would give industries that use clean coal technology additional time and flexibility in meeting the standards.

Argonne National Laboratory has sold a process that could dramatically reduce pollution from coal fire power plants to a Pennsylvania company, lab officials said Tuesday. The buyer, Dravo Lime Co., of Pittsburgh, which makes chemicals for smokestack scrubbers, is betting that tighter acid rain controls will make the deal a profitable one. Officials say the process can be used with existing equipment to reduce by 70 percent a plant's output of nitrogen oxide believed, along with sulfur oxides, to be a major cause of acid rain.

By suggesting that the nation's approach in attacking smog is flawed, the study could bolster industry efforts to fend off even tougher requirements. Some states are considering whether to join California in requiring far tougher controls on emissions on cars and fuel than are required nationally.

Congress, spurred on by President Bush's promise to do something this year about acid rain, is beginning what could be the final confrontation in an eight year, multi million dollar lobbying war over clean air. The opening volley was fired Thursday when more than 100 House members, most allied with environmental groups, introduced legislation to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by more than 40 percent and nitrogen oxide emissions by about half that amount. The gases are the two major components of acid rain.

The run down of British Coal is taking place against the background of a huge effort elsewhere in the world to develop efficient 'clean coal' power stations which could compete with natural gas on economic and environmental criteria. The problem in the UK is that the only coal fired stations capable of competing financially with natural gas plants at today's prices are old ones whose capital costs have been written off. And they produce more pollution sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide.

CSO <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the rubric It Is Official : </F> Deputy Prime Minister Zaveryukha's Opinion: No Improvement ] [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha, whose duties in the Russian Federation government Include environmental protection oversight, noted that despite the stoppage of many hazardous enterprises in industry, the ecological situation in the country has not improved and still leaves a lot to be desired. According to data of the Rosgidromet [Russian Federal Service on Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control] Main Geophysical Observatory, the air basin over a considerable number of cities (observations were made in 247 Russian cities) remains unhealthy. In the 44 cities with the most polluted air basin (the so called priority list), it increased considerably between 1988 and 1992.

Acid rain could be almost as big a contributor as fertilizer runoff or sewage and industrial water pollution to the decline of marine life in East Coast estuaries, an environmental group concluded today. A study by the Environmental Defense Fund said nitrate compounds from the atmosphere originating mostly as nitric acid contribute 25 percent of the total nitrogen input to Cheasapeake Bay, compared with 34 percent from fertilizers and 23 percent from municipal sewage and industrial discharges. Nitrates act as fertilizers, encouraging blooms of algae that use up oxygen dissolved in the water and making it difficult for other plants and fish to live.

Scientists have concluded that acid rain is one of the main pollutants threatening marine life in Atlantic coastal waters, The New York Times reported Monday. Up to now, most experts have assumed that agricultural runoff and sewage were the major culprits responsible for the increasing number of mass killings of marine life along the Northeast coast, the newspaper said. But a new report prepared by scientists of the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit environmental group, shows for the first time that acid rain is also contributing to the problem, according to the newspaper.

Matsushita Seiko plans, for the time being, to apply this NO[.sub]x[/] removal agent to filters that will be incorporated in its own commercial products, including air cleaners, air supply type ventilators and heat exchanger type ventilators, to upgrade the functions of these products. The developed NO[.sub]x[/] remover is based on the matrix of a copolymer of styrene and divinyl benzene, which is a porous, polymeric, chelating resin.

The Bush administration says nine states, with some of the nation's dirtiest coal burning power plants, do not deserve financial help from other parts of the country to cut acid rain emissions. William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said Tuesday he opposed changing the administration's clean air bill to provide special help to the the nine states. He produced figures strongly contradicting the states' assertion that they would pay a disproportionate share of costs to reduce acid rain.
