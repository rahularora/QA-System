Steam locomotives built in the Philadelphia area were exported to railroads around the world years ago. Now, two companies are importing from China 83 ton locomotives based on a 1918 American design. Two brand new steam engines were unloaded from a freighter Sunday at the Beckett Street Terminal in Camden, N.J., for the Knox &amp; Kane Railroad in northwestern Pennsylvania and the Valley Railroad in Essex, Conn. New steam locomotives haven't been seen in this port since the 1950s, when the old Baldwin Locomotive Works went out of business.

Eccles &amp; Eastern bought its 133 ton 1904 Baldwin locomotive from the city of Watsonville in 1989. Before its move, which started, coincidentally, on the morning of Oct. 17, 1989, the day of the Loma Prieta earthquake the old steam engine had been a fixture for more than a quarter century in the city's Ramsay Park, where children had crawled over and through the old choo choo and a nearby steam shovel. ; The city decided to get rid of the old locomotive because of safety concerns, prompted to a great degree by the discovery of asbestos in the engine, according to Pat Donohue, Watsonville recreation director.

A railroad track abandoned 21 years ago will carry paying passengers again beginning Monday with restoration of service to Grand Canyon National Park. The 64 mile Grand Canyon Railway, originally a spur serving people crossing the high country of northern Arizona on the Santa Fe railroad, will carry tourists arriving in this town of 2,500 on Interstate 40, which largely replaced old U.S. 66. The developers hope the romance of their steam locomotives and the scenery along the tracks will persuade tourists to park their cars and pay the fare rather than drive to the canyon.

The whistle of steam locomotives has returned to the South Rim, and officials say it could usher in a cleaner era at the crowded Grand Canyon overlook. The Grand Canyon Railway was to haul its first paying passengers today over the 64 miles from Williams to the South Rim, 88 years after the first train chugged over the sinous route leading from pine forests to the blood red sandstone of the canyon. The railway, which resumed its run Sunday, restores service that was ended in 1968; since then most of the 3.5 million annual visitors to the rim have arrived by automobile.

It took two tries, but a 104 ton steam locomotive built in China and destined for Iowa was hoisted out of a cargo ship after it was dropped and slightly damaged during a test lift. The new locomotive, the last steamer manufactured at the Datong Engine Works in China, was unloaded from the cargo hold Wednesday and was to be transferred to a rail flat car within two days for shipment to Boone, Iowa, as a tourist attraction, officials said. The first attempt to lift the locomotive with the ship's crane backfired Tuesday when the engine dropped a few inches, slightly damaging the cab, said Dean Briley, a board member of the Boone &amp; Scenic Valley Railroad, which bought the locomotive for $355,000.

The Union Pacific coal train was brought to a stop by an onboard computer that activated the brakes. Although a crew was aboard the train, the computer received instructions by radio from the Union Pacific's central dispatching office in Omaha. Transponders buried in the trackbed transmitted the exact location of the train to an antenna under the locomotive, which then radioed the information to the dispatching center.

A few years ago, Richard D. Sanborn, as president of a CSX Corp. railroad unit, offered to pay certain shipping brokers more if they would send all their business to CSX. But as Mr. Sanborn recently told executives of Conrail, where he became president earlier this year, the plan backfired. Rivals scored with price cuts, and uneasy agents shifted business to other carriers, including Conrail.

Steam passenger service began in 1904 and was extended to Willits seven years later. Gas engines replaced steam in 1925, and the train's famous moniker was born shortly thereafter by trainmen who remarked that the smelly fumes had the aroma of a skunk. Today's trains are almost all diesel powered, but the name has proven longer lasting than the polecat's pungency.

Railroads have long been able to set their own safety standards, and a railroad engineer doesn't even need a driver's license, but federal authorities are rewriting the rules of the rail. Ordered by Congress to take several steps to improve rail safety, the Federal Railroad Administration already has extended its authority over individual railroad employees, increased fines for safety violations, required more testing and certification of train control equipment, mandated automatic train controls on some lines and imposed tough punishment for tampering with safety devices. Most of the actions arise from the Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 1988, which was prompted largely by the Jan. 4, 1987, collision between an Amtrak train and three Conrail freight locomotives at Chase, Md., that killed 16 people and hurt 175 others.

Conrail engineer Ricky Gates, who has become a symbol for many of the industry's problems, is serving a five year prison term for manslaughter after admitting he smoked marijuana shortly before the crash and violated several safety procedures. Congress is working on mandatory drug testing bills for railroad employees, and the Supreme Court in March upheld post accident testing. An administration order requiring random drug testing is being challenged in the courts.

The most controversial are a national licensing program for engineers and plans to impose federal standards for rail highway crossing signals. Federal safety officials reported last week that rail crossing fatalities increased 10 percent last year to 689, while other highway accidents went up less than 1 percent from 1987.

The MPS [Ministry of Railways] made a decision: the direct current ChS2 electric locomotives would be repaired in Yaroslavl, and the alternating current ChS4T in Novosibirsk. It is not an easy matter to master the new machine and put it on the flowline. Moreover, the Novosibirsk workers are not planning to trifle with the job they intend to start capital plant repair immediately.

The government can fine railroads or individuals up to $20,000 for tampering with locomotive safety devices under new rules issued by the Federal Railroad Administration. Investigators found that the intentional disabling of a safety warning device contributed to the collision of an Amtrak passenger train and a Conrail locomotive, killing 16 people at Chase, Md., two years ago. Since then, government inspectors have found more than 70 locomotives with warning whistles, automatic stopping devices and other safety systems intentionally diconnected.

Since then, government inspectors have found more than 70 locomotives with warning whistles, automatic stopping devices and other safety systems intentionally diconnected. Many of the 25,000 locomotives operated by the nation's railroads are equipped with one or more of the devices designed to either record data on the engine's operation or to make it safer, the administration said in issuing the final rules Thursday.

But by far the most exciting and romantic sounds to a boy growing up there were the train whistles, and with iron ore coming in and finished steel and paper products rolling out, there were a lot of them. Passenger trains, too, ran on frequent and convenient schedules for townspeople whose companies filled the railroads' trains with freight and pockets with gold. You could lie in bed at night until sleep came and listen to the close by and far off whistles of the big steam engines, picturing them in the darkness above the bed, imagining you were in the cab or tucked between the sheets in the Pullman sleeper.

And while national rivalries are hindering the effort to some extent, the first links of a continental network including a 31 mile tunnel under the English Channel are already under construction. This transportation revolution promises to be a boon for Europe's once beleaguered train making industry. Analysts say orders from investment in a high speed rail system could run into tens of billions of dollars.

Even bigger companies are forging collaboration agreements to strengthen their positions. The shift in train makers' fortunes has been so swift, and opportunities so numerous, that analysts find it difficult to gauge which companies will benefit most from a high speed Euro train network. In general, they rate the prospects good for big concerns such as General Electric Co. PLC of Britain; Alsthom S.A., a unit of France's Cie. Generale d'Electricite; West Germany's Thyssen Henschel, a unit of Thyssen AG; and Italy's Fiat Ferroviaria S.p.A., a unit of Fiat S.p.A. Ambitions for a European network have traditionally been weakened by national initiative and pride.

ASEA Brown Boveri, the European engineering combine, yesterday urged India not to abandon a controversial Dollars 190m (Pounds 110.4m) contract to buy imported high tech locomotives. ABB executives, in India to plead their case, insisted New Delhi should stick to its March decision to award the contract to ABB after a four and a half year bidding process. ABB won the contract for the supply of 30 locomotives against tough competition from three other international bidders, including a partnership between Sumitomo and Hitachi, the Japanese trading and engineering companies.

After four years' deliberation, the railway ministry awarded the contract to ABB, but the decision went for review before the railway convention committee, a government panel. The panel recently advised the government to act in its own best judgment, but only after committee members had dropped hints urging scrapping of the contract. The committee's concerns focused on the cost of the project and a desire to promote India's own engineering industry.

The newest generation of France's high speed passenger trains established a world rail speed record Tuesday when it topped out at 299.7 mph while racing through the Loire Valley, the French national railroad said. The record breaking TGV locomotive comprised two bullet nosed engines pulling four cars, down from the usual 10 cars, the Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer said. The train, which carried no passengers, broke the record of 253 mph set in May 1988 by an Inter City Experimental locomotive in West Germany.

Now, he is promising that Amtrak will do by the year 2000 what hardly any other passenger rail system in the world does: operate without taxpayer subsidies. Success would mark the upset of the century in passenger railroading, says William Withuhn, a rail historian at the Smithsonian Institution.

The engineer who decided to stop a freight train on a steep slope and disconnect the locomotives, causing a derailment and explosion, didn't have the authority to do so, a railroad official testified Thursday. Michael Lemm, Montana Rail Link's trainmaster at Helena, said engineer Robert Estes was not in charge of the 49 car train when he ordered the engines detached and realigned because the lead locomotive had lost power and heat. Lemm testified on the second day of a National Transportation Safety Board hearing into an accident that knocked out electricity in Helena on Feb. 2, when it was 27 degrees below zero and the wind chill was about 70 below.

Engineers on trains without such equipment and planning to use the high speed passenger train tracks should be required to stop before pulling onto the track, regardless of signals, and then be cleared for entry before proceeding, the safety board said.

Amtrak locomotive cabs are equipped with the devices, which automatically start braking a locomotive when the engineer fails to follow required procedures for stopping or slowing down after such signals. The safety board recommendations for requiring automatic train control devices and mandatory train stops before pulling onto passenger train trackage were made to Amtrak, which owns the Northeast rail corridor.

The accident occurred when the Conrail locomotive ran through a stop signal into the path of the Amtrak Colonial, federal officials said, and the faster Amtrak train rammed the rear of the Conrail engines.

Federal investigators have increasingly focused on human error as a likely cause of the crash, after tests suggested that a crucial warning signal didn't malfunction as the Conrail engineer has insisted.

The automatic control systems respond only to the electric signaling unique to the Northeast corridor, an Amtrak spokesman said. The spokesman added that the systems are more needed there because of high speeds of passenger trains and heavy rail traffic.
