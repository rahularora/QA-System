The study, led by researchers at St. Louis University under a grant by Burroughs Wellcome, confirms the preliminary findings of a much smaller test in children that was reported early in 1990. The most recent study, reported in yesterday's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, was included as part of an application to the Food and Drug Administration to market Zovirax against chicken pox. Wellcome is the U.S. unit of the British drug maker, Wellcome PLC.

Although the drug seems to reduce the severity of itchy lesions and fever, some doctors have expressed concern about giving a potent antiviral medicine to young children for an illness that usually passes in less than a week with no lasting effects.

The oral formulations of the drug are a banana flavored liquid, a 200 milligram capsule and an 800 milligram tablet. The recommended dosage for children ages 2 to 12 is 20 milligrams per kilogram of body weight four times daily for five days.

Dr Whitely added that doctors may well prescribe Zovirax, which cost between Dollars 30 and Dollars 55 for a five day treatment, for fear of potential litigation. Chicken pox can lead to serious complications in a small minority of cases and the drug may be able to prevent the disease or lessen its severity. He warned that the drug's high cost and the problems of quick diagnosis would prevent all patients receiving Zovirax.

At its peak in 1980, Reye syndrome struck 555 people. The disease struck 101 Americans in 1986 the year in which aspirin containers were first required to carry warnings about it.

General Nutrition Corp., the national health food chain, has agreed to pay $600,000 to settle allegations that it made false claims for diet supplements. Under terms of the agreement announced Monday by the Federal Trade Commission, GNC agreed to the payment to be divided equally among the American Diabetes Association, American Cancer Society and American Heart Association.

Packages of aspirin are required to carry stronger warning labels against giving aspirin to children and teen agers with chicken pox or flu because of the danger of Reye syndrome under new federal rules. The Food and Drug Administration published regulations Monday after a Public Health Service study found a significant association between Reye syndrome and taken aspirin during chicken pox or flu. The new warning, a modification of one already required on aspirin and aspirin containing drugs, says: WARNING: Children and teen agers should not use this medicine for chicken pox or flu symptoms before a doctor is consulted about Reye syndrome, a rare but serious illness reported to be associated with aspirin.

Superior Court Judge William Pounders said he was shaken after conferring with the juror and his doctor.

SmithKline Beecham has launched itself into a new and potentially lucrative healthcare field with the approval in the UK of famciclovir, its anti viral drug. It has been granted a licence from the UK Department of Health to market the compound under the trade name Famvir for the treatment of herpes zoster, better known as shingles. It will allow SmithKline Beecham to challenge the effective monopoly in anti viral drugs held by Wellcome, its UK rival.

St. Joseph's Aspirin for Children, once a leader in over the counter pain relief for youngsters, is slowly disappearing from medicine cabinets. The manufacture of the chewable orange tablets ended in December 1986 as Shering Plough Corp. of Madison focuses on chewable low dosage aspirin products for adults concerned about preventing heart disease. Aspirin free pain relievers and name brand aspirin products competed with each other until the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a report in 1982, said giving aspirin to children suffering from chicken pox and influenza increased the risk of contracting Reye's syndrome.

Analysts believe that if the broader, phase three human tests go well, Proscar could be a big seller because it would be the first problem free pill to treat enlarged prostates, a condition that afflicts half of all men over the age of 70 and that is sometimes associated with prostate cancer.

A government stamp of approval is no guarantee a product is safe, so manufacturers should not be exempt from punishment when an approved product causes death or injury, consumer advocates said today. Four national consumer groups reported that more than 1,300 deaths and thousands of serious injuries in the last 10 years resulted from the use of drugs and medical devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The report was issued as the Senate Commerce consumer subcommittee held its third hearing on federal product liability legislation backed by the Bush administration.

The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved a drug officials say will dramatically improve the lives of children born with a rare disease that makes them unable to fight infections. About 40 children worldwide are born each year with severe combined immunodeficiency disease, or SCID, a genetic disorder also called Boy in the Bubble disease because some children have survived only by living in an enclosed, sterile environment. Peg ADA was developed with a $169,000 grant from the FDA under the orphan drug program, which is designed to give companies a financial incentive to develop products for an extremely small patient population.

With the help of biotechnology, researchers are developing vaccines for diseases against which there is no protection today, from malaria to Aids. At the same time they are working to combine existing vaccines and ultimately achieve the World Health Organisation's goal of an 'ideal children's vaccine' which would deliver immunity against all serious childhood illnesses in a single dose shortly after birth.

So far, five of the adults, but only two of the adolescents and children, have contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome. In the third study, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta also found greater resistance to the disease among teen age hemophilia patients than among adults, Dr. Janine Jason said. AIDS is spread most often through sexual contact, contaminated needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

AN INTERNATIONAL offering of shares in Wellcome, the drug company best known for its Aids treatment Retrovir, that could raise more than Pounds 4.5bn at current prices is expected this summer. This follows a decision by Wellcome Trust, the medical research charity, to sell part of its 73.6 per cent stake in the company. Mr John Robb, chief executive of Wellcome, said last night that the sale would help investors who had experienced difficulty buying shares because of the limited number that were freely available.

The court, without comment, let stand a Wisconsin judge's order that the maker of Bayer aspirin reveal numerous company records. Sterling Drug Inc. said forcing it to turn over some of the documents violates its free speech and due process rights.
