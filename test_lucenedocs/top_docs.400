Blacks, Hispanics and women can't be kept off juries as a group, but it's OK to exclude people whose last names begin with the letters W through Z. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 3 0 Wednesday that jurors at the end of alphabetical order do not constitute a recognizable and distinct class covered by court decisions barring discrimination in jury selection.

The claim was raised by a man whose last name begins with a W William Jefferson Walker. He was convicted of aggravated assault and leaving the scene of an accident in Pima County, Ariz., in September 1983 and sentenced to 10 years in prison. For reasons not explained by the court, the pool from which the jury was chosen included no one with a surname starting with W through Z. Walker cited a psychologist's study, published in 1970, that concluded people whose names started with letters from S to Z were 50 percent more likely than others to develop a condition called alphabetic neurosis.

Anyway, when you dialed the 1, it sent out a pulse, a single clicking sound (a 2 was two clicks, etc.). According to Chuck Starnes of Bell Laboratories in Indianapolis, the fussy old switching equipment at the phone company could easily get confused, and mistakenly think that a random clicking noise on the line was someone trying to dial a number beginning with 1. Thus a rule was made: No phone number can start with 1.

Not content with one begging letter, the Turks have just come up with five in the hope of persuading the rest of the former Soviet Union's quintet of Turkic states to join Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan in abandoning Cyrillic notation in favour of Roman script. Turkey's decision to increase the alphabet by the five new letters is a historic gesture. It is the first such change since the western reforms of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1928 when the Turks themselves adopted the Roman script in place of the Arabic used under the Ottomans.

The Supreme Court ruled today that police in Pennsylvania did not violate the rights of a man suspected of drunken driving by failing to read the motorist his so called Miranda warnings soon enough. The justices, by a 7 2 vote in an unsigned opinion, agreed with Pennsylvania law enforcement officials that a lower court wrongly required police to warn motorists of their right against self incrimination. Relying on a 1984 ruling, the court said that ordinarily when police stop a motorist they are not required to give the Miranda warnings because the motorist is not in custody.

The Communist Party chief in Soviet Moldavia has endorsed demands by Moldavian nationalists to make their language official and use the alphabet of neighboring Romania. Thousands of demonstrators rallied in recent weeks in the republic's capital, Kishinev, to demand official status for the Moldavian language and introduction of a Latin alphabet, used for the otherwise identical Romanian language. Despite attempts by the Russian Czars and Soviet authorities to align Moldavians with Russia, Romania has long maintained that Moldavians are really Romanians in language and culture.

The initial proposal to make Moldavian the official language caused widespread strikes and protests by ethnic Russians and other Russian speaking ethnic groups in the southern republic bordering Romania.

CSO [Text] Although the law on identity cards is not being passed, the Interior Ministry is announcing the introduction of new identity cards in the spring; the introduction of the new cards will be done on the basis of the old regulations, with a change in the form for the identity cards; a filter for uncovering individuals without Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia FYROM] citizenship. While the adoption of the law on identity cards by the Macedonian Assembly is waiting for better times, the Interior Ministry is preparing a counterstrike it will start to issue the new identity cards as early as April, and possibly the beginning of June. Regardless of whether the new law is passed or not, legal form will be ensured by applying the old law, but with changes in the regulations.

Otherwise, it is planned that the replacement of identity cards will be carried out within one year, but the Interior Ministry thinks that the entire operation can be completed in a shorter time, in view of the capabilities of the system, which makes it possible to issue 300,000 identity cards in a month.

Being made of biological materials, the eye was far more compact than a comparable device made of microelectronic parts, and thus could be a forerunner of eyes for robots. The key component of the artificial photoreceptor, as the scientists called it, was a light sensitive protein called bacteriorhodopsin. It was extracted from a bacterium that ordinarly uses it for photosynthesis, the conversion of sunlight to electrical energy.

Lawmakers in the southern republic of Moldavia opted Friday for more compromises that severely weaken attempts to require all residents of the republic to speak the Moldavian language, activists said. The legislature, or Supreme Soviet, named Moldavian the state language Thursday but said Moldavian and Russian could be used in everyday life. That infuriated thousands of Moldavians, who demonstrated on the street late into the night while the lawmakers debated.
