The space shuttle Discovery cleared one of its final hurdles as the space agency successfully test fired a solid rocket booster with flaws intentionally drilled into it. The hardware and data tell us this booster is ready to fly, said Royce Mitchell, manager of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's solid rocket booster program. The space shuttle Challenger exploded Jan. 28, 1986, when hot gasses escaped from a tiny gap in a faulty booster seal.

An apparently flawless test firing of the space shuttle's redesigned booster rocket has improved the odds of NASA meeting its goal of resuming manned space flight in mid August, officials say. Wednesday's two minute firing of the 126 foot rocket went smoothly, but spokesmen for NASA and Morton Thiokol, which manufactures the booster, say it will take a week to 10 days to verify the test was a success. A cursory inspection of the rocket afterward indicated the redesigned seals in the booster's joints prevented an escape of hot gases despite deliberately built in flaws.

Discovery moved into the glare of spotlights early Monday on its long awaited trip to the launch pad and a giant step toward America's first space shuttle flight since the Challenger tragedy. A flag waving Fourth of July crowd of several hundred space workers cheered as the 85 ton spaceship edged out of an assembly building at 12:50 a.m., riding upright on the broad back of a giant tracked transporter called a crawler. The 4.2 mile journey to Launch Pad 39B was scheduled to take six to seven hours.

Seals in a revamped version of the shuttle booster joint blamed for Challenger's destruction worked in a test firing despite intentional flaws, helping Discovery pass its most significant milestone, the rocket's manufacturer says. An analysis of the Aug. 18 test at Morton Thiokol Inc.'s northern Utah plant found that the aft seal, though the worst flawed deliberately, succeeded in preventing superhot gases from escaping, the company said Thursday. The success of the test, the fifth and final qualifying firing of the new 126 foot solid fuel booster, was vital to NASA's plans to resume shuttle missions grounded since the Challenger disaster on Jan. 28, 1986.

The booster tested Tuesday was free of planned flaws introduced in previous tests to determine whether the joint can withstand the intense heat and pressures of launch even in the event of some failures, Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab said. It also was the first use of a new $22 million test stand, which has 1,216 channels of instrumentation and uses hydraulic struts to duplicate steering, flight turbulence and other stresses the motor will endure during launch, he said.

The building also can heat an entire motor to 110 degrees Fahrenheit or cool it to 20 degrees. The rocket's 1.1 million pounds of propellant has been heated to a uniform 90 degrees, or about 20 degrees warmer than the usual launch temperature, to allow engineers to test its performance at the upper limit for an actual launch, Raab said.

An old model nozzle inlet ring was used in the final test of Morton Thiokol's redesigned space shuttle booster rocket, but NASA doesn't believe the discovery will delay next week's scheduled shuttle launch, a spokesman said Wednesday. NASA spokesman Ed Medal said it had not yet been determined if the outdated ring was used in the two boosters attached to the space shuttle Discovery, scheduled for launch Sept. 29, but preliminary investigation showed it had not. There's no indication that the old configuration is in the boosters (in Discovery).

Engineers today sought the source of a small gas leak in a space shuttle steering engine, a new problem NASA officials said could further delay the first shuttle flight since the Challenger explosion. Experts were probing deep into Discovery's left Orbital Maneuvering System engine pod in an effort to locate the leak. But the leak was so tiny it was difficult to isolate, and the process could take several days, said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone.

A new countdown begins tonight for a 22 second firing of space shuttle Discovery's three main engines, a vital test that has been postponed five times because of malfunctions. If this test succeeds, NASA officials will set a date for the first American manned space flight since the Challenger burst into flames on liftoff in January 1986. The Discovery launch date, already officially moved four times, is not likely to be before October because of all the test delays.

An intentionally flawed space shuttle booster rocket performed successfully Thursday in the last test firing required before the resumption of manned U.S. space flights, officials said. We're ready to go launch, Alan McDonald, Morton Thiokol vice president for engineering, said on examining the booster after the 122 second, horizontal test. The $20 million firing was a redundancy verification test to make sure the booster's new joints do what they're supposed to: contain super heated gases during launch.

A simulated shuttle mission designed to test the Discovery astronauts' trouble shooting skills was halted just before a mock landing because of a real life computer crash, NASA officials said. The five astronauts were preparing to end their 56 hour mission Thursday afternoon by simulating a shuttle landing with a flat tire when the computer shutdown cut the rehearsal short. I'm sure they'll be looking at it to see why it went down, but nobody here considers it to be a big problem that the simulation ended early, said NASA Johnson Space Center spokesman James Hartsfield.

More than 2{ years after a flawed booster rocket joint doomed the Challenger, the redesigned part is the safest thing on the space shuttle and elated engineers say the craft is ready to launch. Meanwhile, technicians at Cape Canaveral, Fla., bolted a clamp over a gas leak on the Discovery and applied a sealing compound today as they worked to clear one of the last remaining hurdles to liftoff. NASA spokeswoman Pat Phillips said the compound would have to set for several hours, then workers would run pressure checks over the weekend to determine how well the seal worked.

Company officials described the redesigned rocket as a quantum jump over the previous model. They said this particular test wouldn't fully determine if the new design is adequate. Among other things, they said it wouldn't be capable of determining how the new joints would be affected by gravitational forces that build up in an actual launch, the pressure and temperature changes that take place as the shuttle rises, or how the motor would react when attached to the actual shuttle, with its large external fuel tank.

Mechanical problems are starting to take a toll on NASA's shuttle schedule, and the space agency is wondering whether the troubles are random or somehow related. Columbia stands silently at Launch Pad A this week, grounded first by a bad cooling valve and now by a mysterious hydrogen leak that threatens to push its astronomy mission into July or later. Hardly a month before, one of Discovery's power units had to be replaced at NASA's other shuttle launch pad, an unprecedented job that delayed the Hubble Space Telescope's ride into orbit.

The space shuttle program took another step toward America's return to space with the apparently successful fourth test of a joint on the redesigned booster rocket, a NASA official says. Flaws deliberately built into the nozzle to case joint for Wednesday's test allowed hot gases to reach the joint's primary O ring seal. But the O ring stopped the gases from reaching the secondary or final seal, said Royce Mitchell, NASA solid rocket motor manager.

NASA has selected two sites in Mississippi as the best locations for proposed government owned facilities for the production and testing of a new space shuttle solid rocket motor, the space agency announced today. A location in northeastern Mississippi known as Yellow Creek was selected as a production site for the space shuttle advanced solid rocket motor, NASA said, and the Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Miss., has been selected as a site for the testing of the motor. Yellow Creek is owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority, and Stennis is a NASA facility.
