There is no snap, crackle or pop to Kellogg Co.'s claim that B vitamins in its Rice Krispies cereal provide pep, and the company has agreed to stop some of its advertising on the claim, New York's attorney general said Wednesday. Kellogg, of Battle Creek, Mich., agreed Aug. 4 to stop all advertising in New York that might mislead consumers about the health benefits of Rice Krispies, said state Attorney General Robert Abrams. Kellogg's ads had claimed B vitamins in Rice Krispies would give consumers added physical energy, vigor and power, and also asserted that fatigue was due to lack of these vitamins, Abrams said.

Kellogg's ads had claimed B vitamins in Rice Krispies would give consumers added physical energy, vigor and power, and also asserted that fatigue was due to lack of these vitamins, Abrams said. Of the five B vitamins contained in Rice Krispies, three thiamin, riboflavin and niacin are known to help convert food into the type of energy needed by the body's cells, Abrams said.

Of the five B vitamins contained in Rice Krispies, three thiamin, riboflavin and niacin are known to help convert food into the type of energy needed by the body's cells, Abrams said.

That a number of these better ads seems to be about coffee is a mystery whose depths some enterprising Ph.D. candidate may wish to plumb some day.

An avalanche of cereal come ons has descended on consumers as the industry giants Kellogg Co. and General Mills Inc. go head to head for a bigger share of the lucrative $7.5 billion a year business. Indeed, even as they annually raise prices in the 3% to 5% range, so that some cereals are approaching $5 a box, market leader Kellogg and archrival General Mills are virtually giving away some product to snare business. (Between them, they already hold two thirds of the domestic market, with Kellogg ahead 38% to 28%.

Kellogg Co., which has seen private label brands take a bite out of sales of its most popular cereals, is making its latest price increase a bit easier for consumers to swallow. The world's largest cereal maker said Tuesday it has raised prices on most of its products an average of 3.7 percent, but is exempting Corn Flakes for the second straight year and Frosted Flakes, two of its biggest sellers. Because those cereals and some smaller brands were omitted from the increase, the net price increase is about 2.8 percent, Kellogg spokesman Richard Lovell said Tuesday.

Kellogg Co. agreed not to run certain advertisements for Rice Krispies in New York after the attorney general there accused the company of false advertising. New York Attorney General Robert Abrams alleged that Kellogg's ads promoting the high vitamin B content of its Rice Krispies cereal were misleading. The ads in question implied that the B vitamins would give consumers added physical energy and vigor, the attorney general alleged.

Kellogg Co. has announced a 25 state recall of about 29,000 boxes of Frosted Mini Wheats Biscuits cereal that may contain too much vitamin A and cause a burning sensation in the mouth. The giant cereal maker also said Thursday it had withdrawn an unspecified number of boxes of Rice Krispies cereal at distribution points because they may contain ten times more iron than normal. The levels of vitamin A found in 16 ounce and 20 ounce boxes of Frosted Mini Wheats coded BC117 and BC118 with the expiration date of Aug. 2, 1989, may cause short term discomfort such as a burning, tingling sensation in the mouth, but will not cause any major health risks, company spokesman Joe Stewart said.
