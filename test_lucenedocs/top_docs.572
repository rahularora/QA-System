</P> <P> To keep rich folks from using savings bonds as a tax shelter, the rules also call for the tax break to be phased out if you are married filing jointly with modified adjusted gross income between $60,000 and $90,000, or if you are a single filer with income between $40,000 and $55,000. Below those levels, you get the full break and above them, you will receive no federal tax exemption. </P> <P> Fortunately, those phase out levels will be indexed to inflation, so they will rise in future years, notes Stephen Meyerhardt, manager of public affairs for the Treasury Department's savings bond division.

But while there's no denying that paying tuition will be painful, many financial advisers are playing on parental despair to sell a raft of so called college investments. The chief selling point of most college investments is usually some form of tax break. But most come with high costs, and limit you to a low rate of return, says Elliot Lipson, a financial adviser and fee only insurance consultant in Atlanta.

Assuming a 7% yield, the value at maturity in 10 years will be $18,221, after figuring taxes at the child's 15% rate, says Jim Mulvaney, a tax manager at BDO Seidman, an accounting firm in New York. Meanwhile, if the parents put the same amount in a taxable investment yielding 9%, they'd have $17,657 after 10 years, even taking into account federal and state income taxes amounting to 35%. Mr. Mulvaney suggests that parents consider AAA quality tax exempt bonds.

In August, the FTC said that it had no jurisdiction over the Treasury's advertising but that the Treasury had started its own review and welcomed the FTC's informal comments. House Energy and Commerce Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.) referred Mr. Roberts's complaints to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been vying with the Treasury over which agency should have final say over the regulation of sales practice rules for the government securities market and which has been conducting a widespread investigation of the government market, centering on the activities of Salomon Inc.'s Salomon Brothers Inc. unit But the SEC recently told Mr. Roberts the federal securities laws are not applicable to the Department of the Treasury. The House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee and the House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee both have been looking into the matter at the staff level.

Low and moderate income families would receive tax free interest on savings bonds used to pay for college, under a bill proposed by the Reagan administration. The proposal, called the College Savings Bond Act of 1988, was sent to Capitol Hill by Education Secretary William J. Bennett and Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III. For families with adjusted gross incomes of less than $60,000, interest earned on the bonds would be tax exempt if the proceeds were used to pay for college tuition or related expenses by the bondholder, spouse, child or dependent.

I've always thought savings bonds were good, says Ernst &amp; Young tax specialist William G. Brennan, but the drop in rates has made them even more attractive. Indeed, Mr. Brennan says savings bonds are now attractive for people who might redeem their holding in as little as six months, a far shorter period than he and others have recommended in the past. The basic Series EE bonds still deliver their greatest punch if held for at least five years.

Many investment advisers agree that mini muni bonds are worth a look by small investors as long as they're absolutely sure they won't need the money back before the bonds mature. For many years, individual municipal bonds were available only to well to do investors who had $25,000 or more to shell out. In high tax states such as New York and California, small spenders had to do without the tax advantages of individual municipal bonds or buy municipal bond mutual funds, where the return on investment was unpredictable.

True, money invested in an IRA still grows tax deferred until it's withdrawn.

But the 1986 Tax Act made it tougher to claim an IRA deduction.

The Senate on Thursday seized one of the most popular issues of the presidential campaign and, on a 94 0 vote, approved a tax exemption for interest on U.S. savings bonds that are used to finance a college education. Wading into two even bigger issues taxes and drugs the Senate for the time being refused to raise taxes on cigarettes and alcohol to help pay for a $2.6 billion bipartisan anti drug bill. A 60 33 vote killed the amendment by Sen. Warren Rudman, R N.H., that would have raised the 16 cent cigarette tax by two cents and added five cents to the price of a six pack of beer or bottle of wine and 30 cents to a fifth of liquor.

Reagan administration officials are backing a plan to create tax free educational savings bonds as part of their fiscal 1989 budget proposal. The idea has been a centerpiece of Vice President George Bush's presidential campaign, and Mr. Bush's staff has supported its inclusion in the budget. The proposal is also backed by the Education Department and has been endorsed by White House Budget Director James Miller, administration officials said.

Education Secretary William J. Bennett and Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III have sent a proposal to Congress that would give low and moderate income families tax free interest on savings bonds used to pay for college. Under the proposed bill, entitled the College Savings Bond Act of 1988, interest earned on the bonds would be tax exempt for families with adjusted gross incomes under $60,000 if the money was used to pay for college tuition or related expenses by the bondholder, spouse, child or dependent. The tax benefit would be reduced for families earning between $60,000 and $80,000, and eliminated entirely for households with incomes above $80,000.

Two House committees have approved legislation that would sever virtually all economic ties between the United States and South Africa. The measure to pressure the Pretoria government to abandon its policy of racial apartheid was approved in closed door sessions by the Intelligence and Armed Services committees. The bill, which still must clear two more committees before it can go to the full House for action, would require U.S. disinvestment in South Africa within a year and ban most trade between the two countries.

It costs $13,200 a year to house a federal prisoner while crime victims who receive compensation under various state programs are awarded an average of $3,000 apiece, according to a Justice Department report. The study, released Thursday by the Bureau of Justice Statistics also found it costs an average of $118,200 a year to protect each of the 5,200 people who face possible reprisals when they testify for the government in major criminal cases and $35,500 to conduct a state or federal wiretap. Some $46 billion in federal, state and local taxes was spent on both the criminal and civil justice system in the United States in 1985, the report said, reiterating a figure published in an earlier study.

Richard and Stephanie Hack have not only picked out where their two small children will be attending college after the turn of the century they've already paid their tuition in full. The Bethel Park, Pa., couple bought that peace of mind for about $10,000 through a tuition futures program that had been offered for about three years at Duquesne University, their alma mater. Other young families may wish they had it so easy as they watch tuition increases outpace inflation.

Both George Bush and Michael Dukakis talk about wanting to be the education president, but educators say they have offered little to show how they would earn that title. Many expected education issues to loom large in this race, and there was even a candidates' debate last fall devoted solely to the topic. But the only education issue that really caught on in this campaign was one that the next president will have no say over: whether public school teachers should be compelled to lead the Pledge of Allegiance at the start of each school day.
