Iran and Iraq began a 10 day exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war Thursday, but a jet chartered by the International Red Cross shuttled fewer men than than promised between the enemy capitals. A Red Cross statement issued in Geneva said only 19 Iranians and 41 Iraqis were flown home Thursday despite an accord with both sides providing for the repatriation of 41 Iranians and 115 Iraqis every day. The statement said the reduced numbers resulted from differences of interpretation between the two parties with regard to criteria and procedures.

Political turmoil in Iran is likely to prevent significant progress in a new round of peace talks with Iraq expected to be held soon, an exiled Iranian said Monday. Shahram Chubin, an exiled Iranian historian, said that with two of his senior aides losing their posts in the past few weeks, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran would probably stick to a hard line course rather than expose himself to criticism at home. And of course, Iraq would have little incentive to offer too much if it is not getting an response, said Chubin, who worked at the London Institute for Strategic Studies before taking a teaching post at Geneva's prestigious Graduate Institute of International Affairs.

Iranian Foreign Ministry officials and U.N. officials met last week to lay groundwork for a new round of talks between Velayati and his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz. They have agreed to hold the talks in the near future at an undisclosed site near U.N. headquarters in New York, but no date has been set. The talks have been deadlocked since November over Iran's insistence that Iraqi troops withdraw from Iranian territory, while Iraq insists that the first step should be the clearing of war debris from the Shatt al Arab waterway on the border.

Aziz, speaking to reporters after a meeting with officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the repatriation would apply to 411 Iranians and 1,115 Iraqis who have been identified by the Red Cross.

Iraq is demanding sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab estuary that is its only waterway access to the Persian Gulf and that the outlet be cleared of sunken ships and silt. Iran's priorities include the withdrawal of both side's troops to internationally recognized borders, the exchange of war prisoners and a U.N. investigation to determine who started the war.

Iran on Saturday called for the United Nations to put pressure Iraq so that a permanent truce in the Persian Gulf war can go into effect. A commentary broadcast on Tehran Radio and reported by the official Islamic Republic News Agency said a deadline should be set for putting into effect a U.N. Security Council resolution that calls for troop withdrawals, prisoner exchanges and peace talks. A U.N. mediated cease fire in the eight year gulf war took effect Aug. 20, but peace talks that opened in Geneva five days later broke down immediately.

The Red Cross said Friday it is hopeful a 10 day air shuttle can repatriate more than 1,500 disabled Iraqi and Iranian prisoners as planned, although the exchange started with fewer prisoners than expected. On Thursday, the first day of the exchange, each side sent back fewer than half the number of prisoners envisaged under an accord they signed earlier this month with the International Committee of the Red Cross. Red Cross officials said they were working with both sides to resolve the problems in the first major exchange of prisoners since a cease fire Aug. 20 ended fighting in the 8 year old war between the Persian Gulf neighbors.

Iraq today began freeing Iranian prisoners of war and withdrawing troops from Iranian territory in an effort to settle one conflict while it faces growing world pressure over its occupation of Kuwait.

Saddam's abrogation of the treaty was one of the reasons that pushed the two countries into war in September 1980. His refusal to reinstate that accord which gave Iraq and Iran equal share of the strategic Shatt al Arab waterway was a major obstacle in U.N. sponsored peace talks launched after the cease fire. Saddam had insisited on full Iraqi sovereignty over Shatt al Arab, a major Iraqi outlet to the gulf.

Thousands of Iraqi troops withdrew Saturday from occupied Iranian territory, and Baghdad said those forces would be redeployed in the escalating confrontation with the United States. Iran sent home 1,000 Iraqi prisoners of war as a sign of its confidence that Baghdad's repatration of POWs, which began Friday, will continue. The troop withdrawal and prisoner exchange followed an offer by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday to bring a formal end to the 1980 1988 Iran Iraq war.

With the Iran Iraq war apparently nearing an end, tens of thousands of war prisoners now look ahead to freedom most with joy, but some with dread. Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mohammad Larijani, has said a prisoner exchange could start within three months after the cease fire that took effect Aug. 20. But Baghdad based diplomats say repatriation could be delayed by hard bargaining at Geneva peace talks and by the sheer immensity of the task of registering all POWs and determining whether they want to go home.

Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reiterated criticism Wednesday of any sort of aggression in the region and said Iran considers the presence of American forces in Saudi Arabia ... to the detriment of Islam and Moslems and against the Islamic revolution. His remarks were carried by the Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, before the Baghdad announcement. Iran's press trumpeted Saddam's proposals with large headlines, but one newspaper cautioned that Iran should not become more embroiled in the gulf conflict.

The dismissal of a clergy malpractice suit brought by relatives of a man who committed suicide after pastoral counseling is a deliverance from legal interference in spiritual matters, church leaders said. The court ruled Wednesday that non professional counselors have no legal duty to refer a patient to a psychiatrist or take any other steps to prevent suicide. Neither the Legislature nor the courts have ever imposed a legal obligation on persons to take affirmative steps to prevent the suicide of one who is not under the care of a physician in a hospital, said the opinion by Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas.
