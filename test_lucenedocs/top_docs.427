Potlatch attributed the increased income to a rescheduling of annual maintenance shutdowns from the first half to the last half of this year at two of the company's pulp based operations. Potlatch's wood products group reported earnings for the quarter of $800,000, compared with a loss of $2 million in 1989, the company said. The Northwest Paper division reported earnings of $18.4 million, down from $20.4 million in 1989 because of higher costs, some related to new equipment, and to softer than expected markets, Potlatch said.

Richard B. Madden, chairman and chief executive officer, said second quarter profit would continue to suffer from an early retirement program being undertaken among Potlatch employees in Arkansas. Mr. Madden said he expected soft market conditions to continue for paper products through the second quarter, while there would be some improvement in the wood products markets. Potlatch is a manufacturer of forest products with timberland in Arkansas, Idaho and Minnesota.

The wood products industry is mired in a deep recession, due mainly to the weak housing market and weak prices and overcapacity in other segments. In the second quarter, Potlatch's earnings sank 64% on a 1.5% drop in total sales. Richard B. Madden, Potlatch's chairman and chief executive officer, said earnings benefited from a turnaround at the wood products group, which reported earnings of $14 million, compared with a year ago loss of $1.5 million, on the strength of new capacity, improved operating efficiencies, and lower labor costs.

Potlatch Corp. said it plans to close a 70 year old sawmill in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and expand operations at a Lewiston, Idaho, mill scheduled for renovation this spring. The forest products concern said it will close the Coeur d'Alene mill, which employs 225 workers, by year end. The Lewiston mill, which will shut down this spring for a number of months while it undergoes a $35 million makeover, will ultimately employ as many as 110 additional workers by adding a third shift, Potlatch said.

The NOAA alleged that the companies dumped the pesticide DDT and hazardous chemicals known as polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, from factories into sewers that emptied into Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors and onto the Palos Verdes Shelf off the Southern California coast. The contamination dates to the 1940s, the NOAA said, and has injured fish, marine mammals and seabirds. For example, the agency said that bottlenose dolphins and California sea lions have higher concentrations of DDT and PCBs than any other marine animals it has studied.

Often it is something hard to get, Le Vine says. The relative scarcity of diamonds may explain why Americans value them for such important occasions as betrothals and anniversaries. Among the Kwakiutl, or Kwakwaka'waka, as members of the Northwest tribe prefer to be called, copper was the premier gift after contact with Western culture (grease continued to be an important gift as well).

State and federal officials filed a lawsuit Monday against eight firms that allegedly dumped cancer causing DDT and PCB along the Southern California coast since the 1950s. The unprecedented suit, filed in U.S. District Court, is an attempt to enforce federal provisions requiring polluting companies to restore damaged marine environments, State Controller Gray Davis said. Damages are estimated to range from $50 to $100 million, said Michael R. Valentine, an attorney for the state Lands Commission.

In the lumber market we've seen the worst and demand is going to improve in 1992, Mr. Hay Roe said, adding that pulp prices have bottomed. The eastern Canadian industry, which is more dependent on newsprint, probably hasn't hit bottom yet, he said. John Johnson, an analyst at Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. in Toronto, said I don't think the worst is over for pulp and newsprint, adding that industry earnings could bottom this summer.

This show is engaging both as a visual experience and as a historical presentation. It is at once a tribute to North American Indian art and an analysis of the Brooklyn Museum's role in the history of collecting it during a particularly crucial phase of American museology and ethnology. At the time the Brooklyn collection was being formed, museums still were very much in the process of defining their cultural and scientific roles, especially in relation to the cultures of Others.

Lumber prices are much less sensitive to currency fluctuations, since U.S. producers export only a fraction of their output. But if lumber exports don't hold much significance for U.S. producers, lumber imports surely do. Domestic prices for wood products have been depressed in recent years largely because of a continuing influx of Canadian imports.

Amfac Inc. said its management and the company's investment banker will present a restructuring plan to directors tomorrow. The company has said through the year that it wants to conclude the restructuring plan, designed to maximize earnings potential and shareholder value from all of Amfac's assets and operations, by year end. In recent months, rumors that the long awaited plan might be announced have temporarily driven Amfac shares higher, and yesterday's disclosure that the plan may be getting nearer to completion sent Amfac's stock up $2.25, to $31.50, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
