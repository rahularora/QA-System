But at a recess during the comission's hearings in February 1986, Feynman showed O ring resiliency was sharply reduced by cold. He compressed a piece of rubber like O ring material with a simple clamp, dropped it into a glass of ice water, pulled it out and released the O ring piece, demonstrating that it lacked any resiliency for a few seconds.

The struggling economy of New York City was yesterday given a significant boost when Mr Donald Trump, the property developer and casino operator, announced the go ahead for a Dollars 2bn project on Manhattan's largest undeveloped site. The Riverside South project, comprising 5,700 apartments, 1.8m sq ft of office space, 350,000 sq ft of retail space and parking for 3,500 cars, will be built on the 75 acre site of the old Penn Central rail yards on Manhattan's west side, between 59th and 72nd streets. Mr Trump acquired the site in 1984 but spent years arguing with community groups about his development plans.

Most surprised by the move were project opponents who were caught off guard last week when Prudential determined there wasn't any significant litigation pending, even though two cases have yet to be heard on appeal. Equally devastating to opponents was Prudential's agreement to raise its letter of credit to $241 million from $155 million to cover land acquisition and theater renovation costs.

Equally devastating to opponents was Prudential's agreement to raise its letter of credit to $241 million from $155 million to cover land acquisition and theater renovation costs. This just proves that an obscene subsidy is being granted to a single project if in this market they could go ahead and build four million square feet of speculative office space, said Gary Rosenberg, an attorney who sued to stop the project on behalf of Seymour Durst, a major New York City landholder and developer.

This is the most significant action both because Prudential is committing $2 billion, and because the opponents have exhausted their legal challenges, he said.

Salomon Brothers Inc. withdrew from a controversial and expensive real estate project in Manhattan, sources close to the project said. The investment banker had agreed to co develop the huge, 68 story project with Boston Properties Inc., a real estate developer, and to move its headquarters there. However, the project, located at Columbus Circle near Central Park, has been in jeopardy since Salomon's recent announcement that it would lay off about 800 employees.

But a funny thing has happened in the past six years. Several blocks in the theater district, directly north of the project area, have been acquired by private developers, who are building or planning office towers.

The broadly worded measure, known as Proposition M, limits new development to 475,000 square feet a year roughly one medium sized office building and protects each neighborhood's character from change. Dean Macris, San Francisco's planning director, says, Some feel this is going to create a lot of mischief, but it's too early to tell whether it will be frustrating to worthwhile projects.

The world's first full sized nuclear reactor is eligible to become a national historic site, but some people wonder if a device that helped kill 40,000 Japanese in World War II should bememorialized at all.

Atom spy Klaus Fuchs did practically nothing to help the Soviets develop a hydrogen bomb because much of what he passed along was faulty data, nuclear experts have concluded. The New York Times today reported that those experts in a series of recent books and journal articles suggested that the Soviets learned more about how to make the weapon by analyzing fallout from American H bomb tests. According to the researchers, the material Fuchs gave the Soviets came from flawed early work by Edward Teller, who has been described at the father of the hydrogen bomb.

A lawsuit filed Monday against 13 contractors at the Hanford nuclear reservation claims people working at and living around the plant were hurt by the reckless release of radiation and toxic chemicals. The class action suit filed in U.S. District Court seeks unspecified damages for health threats and reduced property values, said Tom Foulds, who heads a team of lawyers on the project. Twenty one people were named as plaintiffs, but the number of people affected could eventually reach 5,000, according to the suit.

Robert A. Heinlein, who spent a half century writing about man's relation to technology, society and the universe, was remembered upon his death at age 80 as science fiction's prolific grand master. He was probably the best of us all at his peak, Isaac Asimov, one of the top science fiction writers, said Monday. He forged the route the rest of us followed.

Nobel Prize winning physicist Luis W. Alvarez, a brilliant and wide ranging scientist who helped develop the atomic bomb and a theory that asteroids wiped out the dinosaurs, has died at the age of 77. Alvarez, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1968 for his development of the liquid hydrogen bubble chamber and for the numerous elementary particles his team discovered using the device, died late Wednesday at his Berkeley home. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory spokeswoman Mary Barberia quoted Alvarez's wife, Janet, as saying her husband's health had declined since he underwent surgery for a benign brain tumor last fall, and that he died from complications of a series of operations to treat cancer of the esophagus.

The Energy Department said today it agreed to make public the health and occupational records of 200,000 people who have worked in the most dangerous plants in the government's nuclear weapons production complex. The action, which had been anticipated for several months, marks a turning point in a long battle over government efforts to keep secret the data on which its own scientists have studied the health effects of exposure to low levels of radiation. It's a historic development, said Daniel Berger, an attorney for the Three Mile Island Public Health Fund, which sued the Energy Department for release of the records in 1987.

This pressure exists despite two recent scientific review panels that uncovered numerous unresolved safety problems. ; Given the cancellation of several proposed nuclear weapons projects, the only real need for production at Rocky Flats is warheads for the Trident II D 5 submarine launched ballistic missiles.

Consider the following: It is possible to fly into New York on the Trump Shuttle, take a Trump helicopter across the city, during which time one reads a full page Trump ad in the New York Times and a Trump feature story in New York magazine.

On Friday, Mr. Trump failed to make a $43 million payment on Trump's Castle bonds, and he has until midnight Tuesday to cure the default or he could lose the property. Failure to make the payment could also trigger defaults in other Trump properties. But the developer's bankers said that, as a practical matter, they must agree by tomorrow, to have a reasonable chance of getting all the necessary paperwork done in time.

On Monday, three New Jersey banks tentatively agreed to join the arrangement agreed to earlier by four New York banks. That pact means that about 65 smaller creditors who purchased pieces of loans by Chase Manhattan and Citicorp must still approve the deal.

Some of the banks are unwilling to give up their security in such relatively secured Trump projects as the Trump Tower in Manhattan. Other banks are said not to have had the time to consider the package. Under the proposed $65 million bailout, contributions from the various Trump creditors breaks down as follows, according to one individual involved in the discussions: units of Bankers Trust New York Corp., $18.25 million; Citicorp, $18.25 million; Chase Manhattan, $9 million; Manufacturers Hanover Corp., $7 million; First Fidelity Bancorp, $5.5 million; National Westminster Bank, $5 million; and Midlantic National Bank, $2 million.
