Merck &amp; Co., the nation's leading drug company, and E.I Du Pont de Nemours and Co. are joining forces to develop a new class of heart disease medicine under a research and marketing pact, the companies said today. As part of the collaboration, Merck will turn over to Wilmington, Del. based Du Pont the rights to sell two of its drugs in exchange for a percentage of the proceeds.

Preliminary tests in Parkinson's disease patients suggest that a new medicine born of research on illicit street drugs may slow the progress of the degenerative brain disorder. Two California researchers reported that the medicine, called deprenyl, postponed the onset of severe symptoms of Parkinson's disease in a small group of patients with very early signs of the disorder. In the study, 27 patients given deprenyl went for an average 18 months before developing the severe symptoms, while another 27 patients given a placebo, or inactive drug, developed the symptoms after about 10 months.

Officials at Du Pont Merck said Cardiolite may be especially useful in helping to diagnose the exact nature of a heart attack within hours after it occurs. Unlike other imaging products, Cardiolite can be injected during the attack and the blood flow can be recorded immediately, giving a doctor an instant picture of the attack. Other techniques can't be used until a patient's condition has been stabilized.

In one test, rodents given linopirine remembered the shocks more often than those given THA, a Warner Lambert drug that was unfavorably reviewed by regulators recently. Du Pont Merck officials say a preliminary, 500 patient test of linopirine was encouraging, but add that a new study comparing it with a placebo is needed. Odds and Ends AN ANALYSIS in the Journal of the American Medical Association of several studies provides strong evidence that a daily tablet of aspirin can reduce a pregnant woman's risk of developing high blood pressure, which can be dangerous to her and the fetus.

Du Pont was backing several studies of Ampligen under an agreement with HEM Research Inc., a closely held concern that developed the drug. Du Pont said it dissolved that pact.

As a result, Parke Davis scientists are racing against Merck and others to develop new drugs against asthma, arthritis, allergies, diabetes, stroke, heart disease and mental health problems. But none of these potential breakthrough medicines is expected to be approved soon.

The pharmaceutical industry has an abysmal record in treating disorders of the brain and nervous system. While new drugs have transformed the outlook for people suffering from infectious illnesses, heart disease, and gastro intestinal problems, most psychiatric patients depend on medicines discovered several decades ago. Current treatments for mental conditions, from mild anxiety to severe psychosis, emerged during the 'black box' era of drug discovery.

But after Ampligen failed to show efficacy in the large trial, Du Pont alleged that it had been provided misleading information by HEM, a closely held company based in Philadelphia. Du Pont said the damages sought in its suit, filed in a Delaware state court, far exceeded HEM's net worth of $8.5 million at the end of 1988. HEM, for its part, has contended that the plastic bags Du Pont used to package Ampligen, which is given intravenously, impaired the drug's potency.

In the race to find an AIDS cure, for example, a number of large companies are establishing presences by bankrolling small outfits in the costly procedure of clinically testing a drug. A look at some of the reasons for Du Pont's pullout, based on a number of interviews, offers a glimpse into the particular complexities involved in developing AIDS treatments. Indeed, while AIDS activists and others attack the federal bureaucracy for dragging its feet on AIDS research, the Ampligen affair illustrates that other factors also have hindered the effort.

The results suggested that the drug stabilized the immune system of patients with AIDS related complex, or ARC, a condition that often precedes AIDS. The patients had an increase in the number of their T 4 cells, key agents in the immune system; a decrease in the amount of AIDS virus in their blood; and no serious side effects from the drug.

While Ampligen didn't seem effective in patients who already had developed AIDS, and some AIDS researchers cautioned that even its positive effects in ARC patients involved too small a sample of patients to allow for a proper analysis, the report spurred great excitement.

While he and other Du Pont executives said they believe the recession in the U.S. has bottomed out, Mr. Woolard added, there are no multiple signs that the recession is over, based on sales results from Du Pont's different units.

A newly approved drug appears to be the first to slow Parkinson's disease, seeming to cut the destructive progression of the incurable brain illness in half, a major study confirms. The research, conducted on 800 people, found that the drug deprenyl helped people who were not yet sick enough to require levodopa, the standard medicine for Parkinson's. The results are similar to a smaller study, conducted on 54 patients, that was published in August.

The latest study will continue to test the effect of the medicine when combined with levodopa in people with advanced Parkinson's disease. The earlier study with the drug was conducted by Dr. J. William Langston of the California Parkinson's Foundation in San Jose and published in the journal Science.

A new study indicates a drug called deprenyl delays serious symptoms of Parkinson's disease and allows patients to work and function twice as long as people not taking it. In a study to be published Friday in the journal Science, Dr. J. William Langston of the California Parkinson's Foundation reported that patients with early symptoms of Parkinson's who were treated with deprenyl postponed progression of the neurological disease for an average of almost eight months. It seemed to slow the rate (of symptom progression) by about half and doubled the time before they needed treatment, Langston said in a telephone interview.

A drug recently approved for Parkinson's disease appears to be the first to slow down the crippling disorder and may be the first effective treatment for a degenerative brain ailment, a major study today confirms. The study conducted on 800 people began in 1987 and was scheduled to continue until late next year. But because of the drug's dramatic effect, the researchers ended the study in February in order to provide the medicine to the patients in the control group, which received placebos.

J.M. Schneider Inc. of Ontario, Canada, is voluntarily expanding its recall last week of 22,000 pounds of frankfurters to include grocery stores nationwide, the Agriculture Department says. Officials said Tuesday the recalled franks are suspected to being contaminated by Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause listeriosis, a potentially serious disease.

Sharp food price increases and rebate reductions will force nearly a quarter of a million low income pregnant women and children from a federal supplemental nutrition program, according to a survey. Between March 1990 and September 1990, the end of the current fiscal year, our survey found that at least 240,000 participants would no longer be served by the WIC program, Dennis Bach, president of the National Association of WIC directors, said Tuesday. Bach said at least 25 states already have begun reducing their monthly participation in the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC.

Some doctors who have worked with Ethmozine say it appears safer than some other anti arrhythmia drugs, which themselves can induce heart problems in certain patients. Last year, for example, U.S. health officials cautioned doctors against using two other drugs for mild arrhythmias after more patients taking them in a government sponsored study died of heart attacks than did patients taking a placebo.

The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved three tests for a blood borne virus linked to a rare form of leukemia and recommended that blood banks begin screening for it. The development has been expected for some time and blood banks have started preliminary planning to test for HTLV I, short for human T lymphotropic virus type I. The disease, called adult T cell lymphoma, may appear in a small number of people 20 years to 40 years after they become infected with the virus, the FDA said.
