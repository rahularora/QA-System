<P> For anyone who's ever suspected that psychotic fantasies lay behind many of the big 1980s action movies, the spectacular futuristic thriller Total Recall (citywide) offers tongue in cheek proof. </P> <P> Here, possible psychosis is the movie's mainspring. Is the major character, Arnold Schwarzenegger's Doug Quaid, really a malcontent construction worker obsessed with dreams of Mars and sleazy brunettes?

VIDEO TIP: Somewhere in To tal Recall lurks a condemnation of in terplanetary colonialism.

Arnold Schwarzenegger has the muscle, so to speak, to direct one of his own movies, but he didn't want to make his debut on such a major project. Instead, he directed a 30 minute episode of Tales From the Crypt for Home Box Office, which will be seen Saturday as part of a trilogy of the ghoulishly witty series taken from the 1950s comic book. Although you have a chance to walk into a top spot of directing, because of where you are in your career, I didn't feel comfortable with that, Schwarzenegger said.

President elect George Bush paid tribute to the Special Olympics at a movie premier Monday night, and put in a word of thanks to he man actor Arnold Schwarzenegger for his efforts in Bush's successful campaign. Schwarzenegger and diminutive actor Danny DeVito are the stars of the new comedy film, Twins, in which they play an unlikely pair of fraternal brothers separated at birth. The gala premier at the Kennedy Center benefited the Special Olympics, launched two decades ago by Schwarzenegger's mother in law, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of the late President John F. Kennedy after whom the Kennedy Center is named.

With last year's big budget effects films eclipsed by such low cost offerings as Home Alone and Pretty Woman, studio executives have been loath to approve projects packed with space battles and robots. Paramount Pictures has cut back effects work on its Thanksgiving release Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country to place the emphasis on the story rather than the pyrotechnics, a studio publicist says. On Walt Disney Co.'s The Rocketeer, a $40 million fantasy opening Friday about a 1930s pilot who finds a rocket backpack and becomes a superhero, we've tried to utilize the minimal number of effects possible, says director Joe Johnston, a former effects artist himself.

Desert themes were already much on the mind of Mr Michael Eisner, Walt Disney's chairman: the company has just released a low budget sequel to its hit animated movie 'Aladdin' directly into the US video market bypassing cinemas and this follow up, called the 'Return of Jafar', is proving a big hit.

First, spring was unusually bad at the box office, with so few American made hits that a low budget British comedy, 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', briefly became the most popular movie in the country. Second, the studios are releasing an extraordinary number of films this summer about 60 and they cannot all be hits. Films that do not perform well over the weekend they are released, or during the subsequent weekend, will be quickly and cold bloodedly yanked from cinema schedules.

The movie, which received mostly mixed and a few positive reviews, finished atop the box office charts, but earned only $15.5 million in its first three days, according to figures released Monday by Entertainment Data Inc.

But the past 10 days have also seen the release to big audiences (but mixed reviews) of two more movies with substantial hit potential: Sleepless in Seattle, a romantic comedy featuring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan; and The Firm starring Tom Cruise, a thriller about a crooked law firm based on the best seller by John Grisham. The summer season is one of the two the most important times of the year for the US movie industry, which releases its most popular films now or at Christmas, when people tend to have more leisure. The three and a half months of summer generate about 40 per cent of annual US box office revenues.

So far this summer US ticket sales are up 7 per cent on 1992, according to Mr John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations, a film industry consultancy, who reckons that a host of films only now being released will provide a 'second wave' of momentum.

While the film is this year's biggest hit, it isn't likely to make the all time top 10 list, analysts said. It will probably be in the top 15 worldwide when all is said and done; maybe 12th or 13th, said Philip Garfinkle, senior vice president of Entertainment Data Inc., a Beverly Hills, Calif. based firm that tracks box office performance.

But while costs are soaring, she says, the revenue side of the equation has also become enormous, with the overall level of business expanding everywhere. Increasingly, Ms. Balsbaugh notes, domestic box office revenue accounts for only about 20% of some movie's revenues, with post theatrical markets such as video and television and overseas markets bringing in the lion's share.

Foreign television and home video markets are on the upswing.

Increasingly, Ms. Balsbaugh notes, domestic box office revenue accounts for only about 20% of some movie's revenues, with post theatrical markets such as video and television and overseas markets bringing in the lion's share. Theaters in France, Europe and the U.K. are being expanded and refurbished, often by U.S. companies that also own movie studios, such as Paramount Communications Inc. and Time Warner Inc. Foreign television and home video markets are on the upswing. Still, U.S. box office performance remains a crucial barometer of big success in other markets.
