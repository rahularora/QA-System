With fewer than 70 shopping days till Christmas, millions of Americans are avoiding long lines, bad weather and crowded parking lots by doing some or all of their Christmas shopping by mail. Many people find mail order more convenient and sometimes cheaper, since state sales taxes aren't charged if the recipient is out of state. But if Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.) has his way, mail order firms will have to collect sales taxes on all their transactions.

Every Christmas season for 15 years, the Hernandez family adorned the pine tree on their front lawn with garland, tinsel and more than 200 festive ornaments. That is until a Grinch chopped it down and made off with the 12 foot Monterey pine that had become a neighborhood landmark. On Wednesday, Ricardo Hernandez walked out the front door and saw only a stump with pine needles scattered about.

A decision to enforce an 11 year old health ordinance on a charitable group's functions has members scrambling to provide a Christmas meal for thousands of hungry Houston residents. Last week, the Health Department started requiring the Citywide Club of Clubs to follow an ordinance that requires food served to the public to be prepared at a city approved kitchen, just in time to cause problems for the group's annual Thanksgiving feast for the needy. The private, non profit community service organization has relied heavily in the past on donations of home prepared food turkey, hams, dressing, vegetables, desserts, relishes to pull off its annual Thanksgiving and Christmas feasts, club Director Leroy Woodward said Tuesday.

The evictions resulted from an ordinance enacted last summer to ban outdoor sales.

Roy Collette will need a jackhammer and a torch this year to open the annual Christmas gag gift of a 2 decade old pair of moleskin pants from his brother in law Larry Kunkel. The gift was delivered to his home Saturday in this southeastern Minnesota city via flatbed semi truck in a concrete filled container resembling a space capsule. As the truck moved slowly up the street, Collette acknowledged he was in for a heavy job of unwrapping.

Volunteers in two cities hustled on Christmas day to cook up and serve replacement donations after thieves stole thousands of dollars worth of food for the needy, and it was the 50th Christmas for Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. As far as Christmas goes, this is it, folks, Col. John Richardson told The Charlotte Observer on Sunday from Panama, where he was leading a task force of troops from Camp Lejeune near Jacksonville, N.C. No sign of Bob Hope. Several dozen pro choice and AIDS activists demonstrated outside St. Vibiana's Cathedral in downtown Los Angeles to protest the Roman Catholic Church's stance against abortion and the use of condoms.
