<P> With the injured Wayne Gretzky a doubtful participant, the battered Kings open the NHL Smythe Division playoffs Wednesday night against the defending Stanley Cup champion Calgary Flames. </P> <P> Gretzky, sidelined after absorbing a hard check from Alan Kerr of the New York Islanders on March 22, is one of six injured Kings. That's hardly encouraging considering the Kings' 8 4 loss to the Flames in the season finale Sunday night and a healthy Los Angeles team's playoff loss to Calgary last season in four straight games.

Gretzky began rewriting the record books after entering the National Hockey League in 1979. Until an injury sidelined him part of last season, he won eight straight Hart Trophies as the league's most valuable player and was its leading scorer seven times. With Gretzky back for the playoffs, the Oilers won their fourth Stanley Cup championship in five years.

<P> The trade of last August that took Wayne Gretzky away from the defending Stanley Cup champion Edmonton Oilers and brought the Great One to the struggling Kings was bound to affect the balance of power in the National Hockey League sooner or later. </P> <P> It's happening sooner. It's happening now.
 LA041489-0066 
</P> <P> It's happening sooner. It's happening now. </P> <P> Stunned Oiler fans saw some of that power slip away Thursday night at the Northlands Coliseum as the Kings came from behind to beat the Oilers, 4 1, snapping Edmonton's playoff game winning streak on their home ice at 14 and sending the series back to the Forum for the decisive seventh game.
