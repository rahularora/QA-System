Colin Powell, tapped as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is widely viewed as an adroit politician and pragmatic commander capable of representing the U.S. military at a time of sweeping change both home and abroad. Powell, 52, was nominated on Thursday by President Bush to become the nation's top military officer. I am ready to go to it and I look forward to the challenges ahead, Powell said.

Colin Powell emerged at 7:45 a.m. to explain the still unfolding operation. Standing before a packed room of reporters and cameras, Cheney laid out the reasoning behind President Bush's decision and then stood aside to watch the youngest ever chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff provide a half hour, detailed breakdown of the most massive military operation since the Vietnam War. Speaking at length without notes about the complex influx of soldiers and their varied missions, Powell made sure to offer the cameras a sound bite, colorfully pronouncing Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's supporters thugs and rabble rousers and declaring, This reign of terror is over.

Powell, a genial and plain spoken 50 year old, is one of a special breed of Washington figures: He is well known within the tightly knit national security establishment, yet largely unknown to the rest of the nation. He has combat experience in Vietnam. He has been a senior aide under three cabinet officers Mr. Weinberger, former Defense Secretary Harold Brown and former Energy Secretary Charles Duncan and has known Mr. Carlucci since working under him in the Office of Management and Budget 15 years ago.

Gen. Powell, who is 54 years old, has been widely praised for his role in the successful war against Iraq. But in recent weeks, there has been speculation that Mr. Bush was unhappy after a book by author Bob Woodward made public Gen. Powell's initial preference for a policy of prolonged economic sanctions rather than military force to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait. Some senior Republican officials said Mr. Bush is privately very unhappy over the book and the suggestion that Gen. Powell wasn't fully behind the administration's strategy on Iraq.

The nation's top military officer, Gen. Colin Powell, jumped into the thick of the battle over the Pentagon budget today, saying quick and severe cuts in military spending would break the back of our armed forces. If you suddenly cash in your insurance policy to buy a peace dividend, you will have neither, Powell said in a speech prepared for delivery to the National Press Club. The speech was the general's first major address on the debate over spending for the nation's military arsenal at a time of lessened East West tensions.

President Reagan's designated national security adviser, Frank Carlucci, is moving to tighten the administration's management of covert operations in the wake of the Iran Contra affair. Mr. Carlucci is proposing the creation of a new interagency mechanism to oversee covert operations carried out by U.S. intelligence agencies, according to administration sources. In addition, he is preparing a directive making it clear that the National Security Council henceforth will be an advisory and coordinating body, not an operational agency, according to officials who are helping Mr. Carlucci reshape the council's staff.

The comments by Kelly and others suggested that what U.S. officials repeatedly have referred to as a mopping up operation was far from over. In an interview Thursday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the Bush administration intends to maintain a signficant military presence in Panama to restore a condition of normalcy, even if some U.S. troops are withdrawn relatively quickly after this week's massive strike. Cheney said U.S. troops in Panama City were not trying to hold every street corner.

The resignation of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger would leave President Reagan's inner circle without the last and most influential of its militant anti communists and could ease the way toward an agreement with the Soviet Union to cut long range nuclear arms and curb the president's Strategic Defense Initiative. Along with the late CIA director William Casey and former United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, Mr. Weinberger epitomized the deep distrust of the Soviet Union and the eagerness to confront communism which dominated foreign policy in Mr. Reagan's first term. That stance now appears to have been supplanted by efforts to reach agreements with the Soviets on arms control and other issues.

GENERAL Colin Powell confirmed yesterday he was thinking of retiring early as chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, but flatly denied this was because of disagreements with the Clinton administration. He appeared on morning television shows after a report in the New York Times had quoted 'friends and associates' as saying he was unhappy with President Bill Clinton's determination to admit homosexuals to the US military and with the extent of the defence budget cuts under consideration. Gen Powell's second two year term as chairman of the joint chiefs is to expire at the end of September.

Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger said the Army apparently charged the Central Intelligence Agency an improperly low price for some of the TOW missiles that the Reagan administration sent to Iran last year. The Senate Intelligence Committee and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are looking into the Pentagon's pricing of the antitank weapons, which were taken from military stocks and handed over to the CIA for shipment to Iran. According to a member of the Senate panel, the Army's sale to the CIA may have been the first in a chain of transactions that ultimately generated profits that were passed on to the Nicaragua insurgents.

After the meeting with Mr. Meese and Mr. Trott, the Justice Department released a terse statement pledging full cooperation with Mr. Walsh and indicating that all relevant matters were referred for further investigation by the independent prosecutor. Department spokesmen declined to elaborate. But officials familiar with the discussion said Mr. Walsh decided to take over a federal probe into the activities of Southern Air Transport, a Miami based cargo airline that investigators believe shipped arms to Iran as well as to Nicaragua insurgents.

There will be fewer stars in the armed forces in the coming years, now that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says cuts in the military must start at the top. Approving a recommendation made by Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the chiefs of the branches of the services, Cheney decided to cut 78 generals and admirals from the top levels of the nation's military leadership. The decision would result only in a 7 percent cut in the number of men and women who wear the gilded stars and braid of the military's highest ranks.
