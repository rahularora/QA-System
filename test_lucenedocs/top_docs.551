Art historians are split over a doctor's theory that Michelangelo's Creation of Adam on the Sistine Chapel ceiling contains a huge image of a brain, symbolizing God endowing man with intelligence. Dr. Frank Lynn Meshberger contends the fresco has been misunderstood since it was created in 1512. The painting was covered with dirt until a recent restoration, so it might have been difficult to visualize a brain, he said.

Restorers cleaning Michelangelo's Last Judgment have decided not to remove changes another artist made to cover images deemed offensive in the Sistine Chapel fresco, Vatican Museum officials said. In 1564, Pope Pius IV, after siding with some 16th century church officials shocked by nude figures in the 60 by 30 foot painting on the wall above the chapel altar, ordered artist Daniele da Volterra to cover up the most indecent nudes. Fabrizio Mancinelli, directing the cleaning of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel frescoes, told a news conference Tuesday that instead of painting over Michelangelo's creation, da Volterra substituted his own fresco after first removing Michelangelo's.

Michelangelo's Creation of Adam painted on the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel contains an image misunderstood for 478 years a huge brain that symbolizes God bestowing intellect on man, a doctor says. The fresco, completed in 1512 for Pope Julius II, shows Adam and God reaching toward one another, arms outstretched, fingers almost touching. Many scholars have interpreted the painting to mean God bestowed life on man.

Michelangelo was not, contrary to popular belief, an angry loner who spent countless hours lying flat on his back as he painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, a Washington University art historian concludes. In fact, the Italian Renaissance master did his work standing on innovative scaffolding, and he had help from as many as 13 assistants, says William E. Wallace, assistant professor of art history. One of the larger myths about him is that he was incapable of working with others, Wallace said Friday.

Ever since its completion during the papacy of Paul III in 1541, Michelangelo's 'Last Judgment' fresco in the Sistine Chapel has been the subject of criticism. The Pope's Master of Ceremonies, incensed by his cameo role as Minos at the Mouth of Hell, begged the pontiff to destroy it; unseemly baggy shorts were added to tone down the prevailing nudity while El Greco modestly volunteered to paint something better in its stead. Even among Michelangelo's supporters, the fresco, on the altar wall, has not enjoyed the celebrity of Adam, on the Sistine ceiling, or Moses on the Tomb of Julius II.

<P> Some clothes belatedly painted onto naked bodies in Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel could come off during a restoration project, returning the work to what the artist originally intended. Michelangelo painted The Last Judgment, conceived as a warning to the unfaithful, above the altar between 1535 and 1541, filling the huge fresco with writhing naked bodies. Veils were painted over the hips of about 30 figures on the orders of Pope Pius IV later in the 16th Century.

The National Gallery's admirable series of study exhibitions, Making &amp; Meaning, focussing on particular works in terms both of the artist's intentions and techniques, continues with a look at the early career of Michelangelo. The period in question is the very end of the 15th century and Michelangelo's first extended working visit to Rome. He arrived from Florence in 1496, aged 21 yet already free from his early apprenticeship in the studio of the brothers Ghirlandaio, Domenico and David.

He arrived from Florence in 1496, aged 21 yet already free from his early apprenticeship in the studio of the brothers Ghirlandaio, Domenico and David. His five year stay was to see not only the confirmation of his stylistic independence as a painter, but an astonishing burst of activity as a sculptor and a sequence of masterpieces the Bruges 'Madonna and Child', the Rome 'Pieta', the 'Taddei Tondo' from Florence and the 'Pitti Tondo' from the Royal Academy, all represented here in casts of the highest quality that established him at once as an artist of the first rank and the fullest maturity.

The two 15 foot tapestries designed by Raphael depict the stoning of St. Stephen and the conversion of St. Paul, and are part of a set of 10 made to be hung below Michelangelo's frescoes on the Sistine Chapel's ceiling.

A DECADE of work by Vatican restorers has removed nearly five centuries of ancient and modern grime from Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, writes Andrew Baxter. But now that the frescoes are clean, how can they be kept so when subjected to the breath and body heat of 2m visitors each year? Today, Pope John Paul II officially accepts the answer a completed air treatment system for the Sistine Chapel from William Frago, president of Carrier, the world's largest air conditioning manufacturer.

As the article on the restoration of the Sistine Chapel noted, the restoration of Michelangelo's last piece, his apocalyptic painting of the Last Judgment, cannot recover the true colors and painting of Michelangelo because the 30 nudes were not just painted over, they were covered with plaster and no one can remove the additions. They were covered up in compliance with the rulings of the Council of Trent in 1563. ; And in the Supreme Court's ruling against nude dancing at an Indiana bar, Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote for the majority that Public nudity is the evil the state seeks to prevent, whether or not it is combined with expressive activity.

A Michelangelo drawing of the suicide of Cleopatra, discovered only last August, will go on display for the first time on Sunday at the National Gallery of Art, Director J. Carter Brown said Tuesday. The new drawing had not been noticed before because it was on the reverse side of a better known work that had been pasted onto a backing. Conservators decided that the well known drawing, which also depicts the ancient Egyptian ruler, was not being preserved properly on the backing, so it was removed.

The House has approved legislation to bring the United States into line with an international agreement to combat illegal trafficking in African elephant ivory. The measure sent to the Senate by voice vote on Monday would prohibit imports into this country of any ivory taken in violation of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. That worldwide agreement uses a system of quotas and ivory markings in an effort to regulate the international trade in ivory from African elephants, whose numbers have fallen to an estimated 700,000 from 1.5 million in 1979.

It is a system that allows one to follow very clearly not only the way in which the arts are related to the history but also the ways in which they influence each other in a given period.

<P> Vatican to Celebrate Sistine Restoration: The Vatican plans an exhibition, an international symposium and books to mark the completion of the restoration of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling frescoes. The Vatican said Thursday that an exhibition will open March 25, marking the end of a 10 year project that cleaned and restored the Renaissance artist's 16th Century masterpieces. The cleaning of the Sistine has been one of the most ambitious and significant art restoration projects in history.

INSTALLATION ART text by Michael Archer Thames and Hudson Pounds 28, 208 page Turning these pages is to experience the tedium of scanning catalogues of light fittings and office furniture, lift cages, sound baffling materials and air conditioning ducts. If this book is intended to excite our interest, engage our sympathy, or at the very least to enter into reasonable intellectual debate with those who find the installation risible as an art form, then it is utterly defeated by the mannerisms and affectations of design. The brief introduction offers little enlightenment, its notions of hybrid discipline, the questioning of autonomous art forms, the crossing of frontiers, the activation of space, the specific influence of local sites, are already commonplace in criticism and excuse we all already know that a bold band of critics believes and preaches that painting has descended from the wall, that sculpture has stepped from the podium, that art is now anything anywhere if anyone says so, and that Everyman is now an artist if he thinks he is.

AMONG casualties in the great shift against Victorian taste early this century, Burne Jones was a spectacular artistic victim. 'Love and the Pilgrim', now in the Tate Gallery, sold for Pounds 5,775 in 1898, Pounds 210 in 1933 and was bought in at Christie's in 1942 for Pounds 21. Yet when the English tide was already turning against him in the 1900s, Burne Jones was still lauded in Europe.

Of the Victorian painters, he set himself most apart from the naturalistic school, and his symbolic forms and sometimes near abstract motifs appealed first to French and Belgian symbolists, then to European art nouveau designers, and later had an important effect on Picasso and Kandinsky.

The head of the pilgrim in a study for 'Love and the Pilgrim' has fleshy androgynous features, the averted eye wide open and confused. The inner mood is hinted at; here is a human type rather than the black clad allegory in the painting.

One after another, proud symbols of cities and empires are disappearing from public view in Italy, victims of pollution and discouraging testimony that restoration can't rescue every monument and artwork. In Florence, the 15th century gilded panels on the east entrance to the Baptistry a door so beautiful Michelangelo thought it was fit for paradise are destined for specially sealed glass chambers inside a museum. Now blackened and devoured by automobile pollution, the 10 bronze panels were done over 23 years by Lorenzo Ghiberti before his death in 1455 to depict the Creation and other Old Testament stories.

The biggest show of Michelangelo drawings ever exhibited in this country will give Americans a unique chance to judge a major argument among art lovers: did he design a round dome for St. Peter's in Rome, or the taller dome St. Peter's now has, like the U.S. Capitol? Originally the Capitol, built and rebuilt three centuries after St. Peter's, had a round dome. The exhibit called Michelangelo: Draftsman@Architect opens Sunday at the National Gallery of Art.

According to the gospel that the best art is spontaneous and inspirational, drawings should reveal artists at their most creative and the more swiftly executed they are the better. Any subsequent polishing represents a watering down and loss of the initial divine spark. Drawing may indeed be the automatic writing of art, yet the first draft is not invariably the last word.

Also in 1939, Hollywood's most artistic and productive year ever headlined by Gone With the Wind, an essay by art critic Clement Greenberg, Avant garde and Kitsch, warned that synthetic art had become an integral part of our productive system in a way in which true culture could never be, and that its enormous profits are a source of temptation to the avant garde itself. With the proliferation of television after World War II, cereal and toothpaste were being beamed into millions of homes every day.
