Orion Pictures has scheduled the release of Jonathan Demme's new thriller, The Silence of the Lambs, for Feb. 14, 1991. Though debuting on Valentine's Day, the film is by no means a romance. Based on the shocking best selling novel by Thomas Harris, The Silence of the Lambs stars Academy Award winner Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, a gutsy FBI trainee haunted by her past, who risks her life in an attempt to save a missing woman from death.

Since the huge success of The Silence of the Lambs, publishers and studio executives are on the look out for the next Thomas Harris. The American author Patricia Cornwell, who has made serial killers her speciality, has set up her own film company and is looking for an actress to play her pathologist heroine Dr Kay Scarpetta. Cornwell's novel Cruel and Unusual won last year's Gold Dagger, the top award for crime fiction in Britain.

Time for the round up of the year.
