MR PADDY Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday joined prominent members of Labour's front bench in arguing for a fundamental overhaul of the workings of the monarchy. His remarks will stir fresh debate on the opposition benches at a time when the Labour leadership has been trying to play down the issue for fear of alienating royalist voters. A straw poll of 100 Labour MPs in The Sunday Telegraph yesterday showed almost a quarter want a republic, 32 per cent a monarchy along Dutch or Scandinavian lines and only 14 per cent back the royal family continuing unchanged.

Senior ministers yesterday tried to quell public anxiety about the future of the monarchy after the publication of extracts from a controversial book about the private life of the Prince of Wales. Amid concern that the book, written with Prince Charles's co operation, could undermine the monarchy's authority, two cabinet ministers and a constitutional expert launched a spirited defence of the heir to the throne. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said recent revelations in books and newspapers about the royal family had led to the monarchy's detractors 'getting everything out of proportion'.

Mr Tony Benn, the Labour MP for Chesterfield, yesterday claimed to have found a constitutional loophole that may put an end to Britain's 1,000 year old hereditary monarchy. His claim raises the republican flag at Westminster at a time of increasing controversy over Prince Charles's fitness to inherit the throne. It coincides with the transmission later today of an ITV documentary in which the prince is said to admit adultery and to promote the disestablishment of the Church of England.

Liberal Democrats yesterday voted by an overwhelming majority against a policy of abolition of the monarchy, but called for 'a radical trimming' of the royal family's budget. In the first debate at a political party conference on the issue, several speakers argued that the monarchy should be discontinued after the reign of the present Queen because hereditary rule was unacceptable in a modern democracy. But delegates were strongly swayed by the argument that the party's standing with the public would be badly damaged if it backed abolition.

Labour is drawing up a comprehensive constitutional reform package that would cut the cost of the royal family and prevent ministers from using the antiquated rules of crown privilege to bypass parliament. The proposals prompted outrage from senior ministers, many of whom believe the Conservatives would win a general election fought on constitutional issues such as the role of the monarchy and the UK's place in Europe. Labour's proposals, which will be given a preliminary airing tonight in a BBC Panorama documentary on the monarchy, are being drawn up by a Commission on Democracy that will report to the party's 1995 conference.

The British constitution, contrary to what is widely believed, is not an unwritten one but is written down in detail in a network of personal oaths of allegiance which are imposed on everyone who exercises any responsibility in the state and binds them, individually, to the crown. All MPs, peers, mayors, judges, officers, police officers and many others are required to take such an oath. Privy councillors, who include all cabinet ministers, have a special and secret oath administered binding them even more tightly to the crown.

It is to offer this country a chance to adopt a democratic constitution that would give everyone the right to choose, through the ballot box, their head of state and both houses of parliament, as happens in every modern democracy.

Even President Zhelyu Zhelev, a former dissident, who used to be the most popular politician in Bulgaria, recently came behind King Simeon in public opinion polls. The 57 year old king, who lives in Madrid, is widely considered to be closer to restoration as a modern constitutional monarch than any other exiled royal claimant in the former communist world. Many of the 49 political organisations contesting the election have sought to capitalise on the popular longing for 'a good and just king'.

The bodies were buried in roadside graves from which they were exhumed only after the end of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: they have not yet been reburied, though are due to be, in the Peter and Paul Fortress in Petersburg, which the Queen will visit. The last Russian royal family is thus unlikely to come up as a subject of conversation between the toasts.

Few people criticise the prince's involvement in and encouragement for the range of organisations aimed at extending opportunity to those needing a helping hand. Even fewer will criticise the unique ability of someone, by virtue of their extraordinary position, to bang together ministerial heads and painlessly extract more cash out of a parsimonious government. He is ready for more 'ghastly' command performances but he also desperately wants people to realise there is a substance and sense of deep obligation underpinning his life.

Here Fox was able to meditate on the secret of monarchy: its place between the secular and divine, its use of the mysteries of inaccessibility, its function as a centre for artistic display, political patronage, and symbolic meanings. It is a privilege of royalty to be unavailable when it chooses; in Nigeria an oba's henchmen would turn away petitioners by saying his master was still abed. 'These kings were like disappointing zoo animals,' Fox remarks, 'always asleep when you wanted to see them.

Britain today celebrated the 300th anniversary of the bloodless Glorious Revolution that established its democracy and brought to the throne William and Mary, who founded the royally chartered American college. About 1,500 people filled the Palace of Westminster, seat of the British Parliament, for a ceremony celebrating the world's most enduring constitutional monarchy. Among the guests were a U.S. delegation from the College of William and Mary in Virginia, led by former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger.

AS KING Lear discovered unhappily, longevity does not necessarily make a sovereign popular or serene. Indeed, if Queen Elizabeth II contemplates the history of her forebears on the British throne, she must see that the record during the past 200 years or so has been decidedly mixed. Although she is well loved by her subjects, it does not follow automatically that the monarchy's reputation is high and unquestioned.

Previous monarchs have been lively, energetic, cultured, even intellectual: what a refreshing change it would be for that to happen again. Previous monarchs did much more than make an occasional visit to a concert or the opera and were involved, actively and creatively, in the promotion and patronage of the arts: that, too, would be a welcome development.

PENSIONING off the royal family, disestablishing the Church of England and abolishing the House of Lords were proposed by Mr Tony Benn yesterday in an attempt to push the case for republicanism after the Queen's self confessed 'annus horribilis'.

Arguing that the new dispensation would herald not only a new government, but a new state as well, one source noted: Before conquest by Britain, the Zulus were a sovereign nation.

Mr Paddy Ashdown was last night struggling to restore his grip over the Liberal Democrats after the party's Brighton conference again overturned his efforts to present a more disciplined image to the electorate. A defeat for the leadership over its approach to a minimum wage was accompanied by renewed manoeuvring over the party's relationship with the Labour party. Sir David Steel, a former party leader, added his voice to the chorus of senior figures calling for the Liberal Democrats to abandon the pretence that it is neutral between a Labour or Conservative victory at the next general elections.

The Queen is not the only public figure with special tax privileges, but she is the only one who does not pay any income tax or death duties.

PROPOSALS FOR statutory controls on the press were rejected by Mr John Major yesterday amid disclosures that at least one member of the Royal family had sanctioned leaks about their personal life to tabloid newspapers. Downing Street officials said the prime minister would not support the creation of a tribunal with legal authority to impose sanctions against newspapers judged to have breached strict new privacy rules. His stance was revealed as ministers tacitly confirmed reports that the Princess of Wales had played a behind the scenes role in press coverage last year of the break up of her marriage to Prince Charles.

She's only fifth in line to the throne, but from the hospital crowds to the headlines, the birth of Britain's newest princess has shown the royal family working a magic that defies even the experts. I can't think why there's such hysterical interest really, said Charles Kidd, editor of Debrett's Peerage, which chronicles Britain's blue bloods. But it just keeps increasing ... Maybe it's because there's been a leveling out of social classes which is very good, but at the same time does make for rather boring reading, Kidd said in an interview.
