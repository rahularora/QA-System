Pitcher Walter Johnson would be second, earning more than $7.5 million per year.

Synergen and Syntex are investigating the protein for stroke patients and have discovered another new protein for Parkinson's disease. Yet another new biotechnology product brain derived neurotrophic factor is aimed at salvaging the shattered neurons of Parkinson's patients.

Yet another new biotechnology product brain derived neurotrophic factor is aimed at salvaging the shattered neurons of Parkinson's patients. This product is made by Genentech and a collaboration of Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks, Calif., and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Tarrytown, N.Y. Those same companies are competing to develop still another related protein called neurotrophin 3 as a possible candidate to treat Alzheimer's and various kinds of nerve damage.

In 1950, DiMaggio hit 32 home runs, only nine of them at Yankee Stadium; of his 361 lifetime homers, 213 came on the road, only 148 at home. ; DiMaggio, of course, has a well documented mystique. He has been part of Americana from the '30s through World War II, from his marriage to Marilyn Monroe, through his immortalization in a Paul Simon '60s lyric, through recognition by a generation simply as television's Mr. Coffee, so he needs no press agent.

Bush, a former Little League coach, used the Rose Garden ceremony to urge the 12 year olds to emulate the example of baseball great Lou Gehrig. The U.S. Postal Service recently issued a stamp commemorating the 50th anniversary of Gehrig's final season, and Bush presented the original painting of Gehrig to an official of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. Bush said the Trumbull team, which defeated a favored Taiwan team at the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa., in August, displayed a spirit which says that nothing is impossible, in Little League or in the bigger fields of life.

<P> Baseball brings out the satirist in some, the sentimentalist in others. The game itself is so rich in costumed imagery, so rife with colorful personalities and vivid vocabularies, that a goofball film such as Major League truly might be more documentary than parody. At the same time, the game is so steeped in tradition, so evocative of heartfelt childhood memories, that a storybook fable such as Field of Dreams makes a straight faced, strait laced pitch that baseball is as everlasting and reliable as anything in our lives, and just about gets away with it.
