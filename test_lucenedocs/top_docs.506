With some modest fanfare, Joan Lunden today celebrates her 10th anniversary as co host of ABC's Good Morning America. This makes her somewhat extraordinary lasting in a job that is a people eater. I have to say I'm surprised that I'm sitting here, being the person who has the most tenure on the morning shows, she says, referring to those in the co host and co anchor business.

These are tough times for NBC's venerable Today show, the program that invented the morning TV format. Last week it lost in the ratings to ABC's Good Morning America for the ninth consecutive week, and it lost the February sweeps to ABC for the first time since November 1985. Is the sun going down on Today ?
