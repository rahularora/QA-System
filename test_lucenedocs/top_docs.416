Cable News Network, the 24 hour all news cable network, is preparing to launch an evening newscast next month, the first time it has scheduled a news program in competition with the three broadcast networks, according to people at CNN. And in an unorthodox move, the Turner Broadcasting System Inc. unit said it hired Catherine Crier, a state district judge from Dallas with no television or journalistic experience, to be a correspondent and anchor. Although CNN didn't specify which program she would be assigned to, the CNN sources said she may co anchor the new broadcast.

When CNN continued its coverage of recorded telephone conversations of Manuel Noriega while appealing a federal judge's order in the case Thursday, a former judge read the story. Catherine Crier, a former Texas District Court judge, was one of several anchors telling viewers that CNN continued to broadcast its first report on the jailed Panamanian dictator because U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler's ruling would amount to unconstitutional prior restraint. Hoeveler issued a temporary injunction in Miami barring CNN from broadcasting parts of recordings of Noriega's conversations with his lawyers that could infringe on attorney client privilege.

Cable News's half hour newscast, called Noticiero Telemundo/CNN, will continue to be seen twice daily over the 18 Spanish language stations owned by or affiliated with Telemundo Group Inc., a New York based unit of Reliance Group Holdings Inc. It replaced a news broadcast produced by Hispanic American Broadcasting Corp. for which Telemundo paid between $3.5 million and $4 million last year, according to Telemundo's president and chief executive officer, Henry Silverman.

MIAMI (A) A federal judge said today he has notified the U.S. attorney's office to represent him in criminal contempt proceedings against CNN for broadcasting Manuel Noriega's taped prison phone calls. Legal scholars have said a contempt hearing could provide a judicial test of whether the government can practice prior restraint on the news media. U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler eventually allowed Cable News Network to broadcast the audio tapes after ruling they did not violate Noriega's right to a fair trial.

He has been held at a federal prison outside Miami since his surrender shortly after the U.S. invasion of Panama last December. Federal prison officials say inmates' telephone conversations routinely are monitored, except when the prisoners state that they are talking to their lawyers.

Attorneys for Manuel Noriega and Cable News Network agreed today to cool off their constitutional showdown, at least until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the issue of tape recorded conversations.

The case of the Manuel Noriega tapes casts a shadow over freedom of the press even though a federal judge lifted his order blocking their broadcast, a constitutional scholar says. U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler brought one legal battle between Noriega and Cable News Network to a close Wednesday when he lifted his 3 week old order barring CNN from airing tapes of the former dictator's jailhouse phone calls. Rodney Smolla, head of the Institute of Bill of Rights Law at William and Mary College in Williamsburg, Va., said he was disturbed that the U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene earlier to throw out the judge's order and that the high court will not get another chance to review the order.

The government has maintained that Noriega knew the calls were being taped and that the calls were not protected by the attorney client privelege.

The Supreme Court is condoning at least brief gag orders against the news media by refusing to let Cable News Network broadcast tape recorded conversations of Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega, say free press advocates. They said the justices' action Sunday was extraordinary and poses grave risks to unfettered reporting of court proceedings nationwide. Attorney Floyd Abrams, who is representing CNN, said, The court has left an opening through which defense lawyers and prosecutors may try to muzzle news articles.

But if such tactics are allowed by lower courts, Abrams said, the Supreme Court might intervene. If CNN is not allowed to broadcast its tapes, such Supreme Court intervention may not be far off.

The Supreme Court refused by a 7 2 vote Sunday to give Cable News Network permission to broadcast tape recordings of conversations between Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega and his lawyers. The court rejected an emergency request by CNN that was aimed at lifting a federal judge's order forbidding the broadcasts until he could determine what the tapes disclose. The emergency request had called the Nov. 8 order by U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler in Miami an unconstitutional prior restraint of free speech.

One tape broadcast was a conversation between Noriega and his defense team in which he speculated about whether two Panamanians captured after the U.S. invasion would testify against him. On another tape, Noriega appeared to be attempting to transfer $4 million with the help of his mistress' mother.

A federal judge extended a ban against broadcast of taped conversations between Manuel Noriega and his attorneys, but Cable News Network defied the order Friday by playing another recording. In the tape, Noriega discussed two potential government witnesses with his defense team, and speculated on the prosecutors' strategy. CNN President Tom Johnson defended the broadcast, calling the judge's order unconstitutional prior restraint.

Prosecutors worked on criminal contempt charges Thursday against CNN for allegedly violating a judge's order prohibiting the network from airing tapes of Manuel Noriega's prison telephone calls. U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler announced his intention last week to press contempt charges against the network because it apparently defied his initial order banning use of the audio tapes. Hoeveler eventually allowed Cable News Network to broadcast the tapes, ruling they did not violate Noriega's right to a fair trial on charges of providing safe passage for Colombia drug traffickers through Panama.

A federal appeals court on Saturday upheld an injunction barring Cable News Network from broadcasting tapes of Manuel Noriega's telephone conversations with his lawyers. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also called on the Atlanta based network to produce the seven tapes in U.S. District Court in Miami so the court could decide whether the broadcasts would endanger Noriega's right to a fair trial on drug trafficking charges.

CNN attorneys on Tuesday handed a federal magistrate a briefcase filled with tapes of Manuel Noriega's telephone calls, saying they were confident the recordings would show his rights were never violated. The network acted in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's weekend refusal to lift the trial judge's order that CNN cease broadcasting the tapes, and surrender them to determine if their use invaded Noriega's attorney client right to confidentiality. We hope and are confident that the court will conclude that the prior restraint is not appropriate under these circumstances, said Steven Korn, chief counsel to CNN's parent company, Turner Broadcasting System Inc. CNN believes ... that the conversations that were telecast were not attorney client privileged conversations.

CNN's coverage of this possible misconduct was delayed by this judicial prior restraint on press freedom, he said.

A federal judge broadened the constitutional issues in the CNN Manuel Noriega tapes case Monday, saying basic fairness could allow him to block broadcast of the defendant's prison phone conversations. U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler cited fairness again in warning prosecutors to either persuade foreign governments to free $20 million in frozen Noriega linked bank accounts to pay defense lawyers, or appear before him for a hearing aimed at proving the money was drug tainted. I am deeply concerned about the image that this case seems to be acquiring that the defendant is not going to be able to get a fair trial, Hoeveler said.
