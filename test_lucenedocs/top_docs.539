In late winter, not far from the beastly old A31, here was a form of the Nepalese daphne bholua, bursting in all directions with flowers of colour and quality which I had never seen before. There are other, rather sparse forms of this famous shrub from the Indian continent, but this particular variety is highly personal to the arboretum. Its parents were conveyed to Hillier by runners from the hills during a visit to Nepal.

This is a variety of the Chinese witch hazel, one of the best of a small genus of winter flowering deciduous shrubs. It starts to flower in December and continues for many weeks as it is quite hardy, even the apparently fragile flowers being undamaged by frost. It differs from ordinary Hamamellis Mollis in having paler yellow, larger flowers which make a better display.

The story of the British climate is written in the nation's flower beds, according to Fred Last, honorary professor of forestry and natural resources at Edinburgh University. He believes the UK's parks and back gardens could be used as early indicators of such climate changes as global warming. Botany and meteorology have come together in Last's own garden in East Lothian.

Matters have not been helped by an awkward season in 1992 for many of the maincrop bulbs in which the Dutch, especially, excel. As for evergreen yew, box and well grown specialities such as viburnum or witch hazel, the same price rises will soon apply wherever the retail trade has grown to depend on foreign stock. The moral, therefore, is to swap impatience for self sufficiency and start to grow as much as possible from seeds from one's own garden and seed lists.

IN THIS sudden week of heavenly weather, an image of the painter Monet keeps returning to my mind. At this moment, the nasturtiums must be flowering along the path of his garden at Giverny, in France, recently recreated for visitors. Perhaps there are still some water lilies, and possibly the agapanthus are as good as mine and almost as good as the most valuable agapanthus in the world, which Monet painted in his 80s and which now hangs in the basement of the Marmottan in Paris.

<P> Though mature writers from John Updike to Saul Bellow recently have been chided for their two dimensional depictions of women in fiction, David Attoe's explosive first novel, Lion at the Door, proves that you don't have to be a woman to penetrate the female psyche. Attoe wiggles into the mind of Hazel Sapper, a girl growing up in industrial England in the 1950s, to reveal the ruin of her youth and life by her sexually abusive father. Through the voices of Hazel, her daughter and her childhood friend Rosko, Attoe convinces us that time doesn't heal all wounds.

It is now the main point of entry to both the heather and the office gardens: the two, although separate entities, are inter connected. Norrie Robertson heads a team of five gardeners who keep the place in impeccable condition.

About 20,000 visitors are welcomed every year, and money is collected for charity from collecting boxes, and from a wishing well. The gardens are open on the first weekend in May until the middle of October. The heather garden is never without flowers throughout the year: one of the great attractions of heathers is that the numerous species provide a continuous succession of flowers though some seasons, particularly spring and late summer to autumn, are more prolific than others.

Now that Atlanta has the 1996 Summer Games in the bag, a local men's club has launched a tongue in cheek campaign to promote the city as host for the 1998 Winter Olympics. The Atlanta Millionaires Club has suggested activities including slalom tractor pulls, snowmobile demolition derbies and contests to determine who is most guilt free about taking off from work because of a few snow flurries. The temperature didn't stop us from getting the summer Olympics, lawyer Tully Hazell, chairman of the winter events committee, said Monday.

THE DAY my wife wrecked her car was a good one for dormice. In no time the recently vacated car port was taken over by three large cages and I was licensed as a keeper in the dormouse captive breeding and release scheme. Dormice are mouse sized rodents, ginger in colour with furry tails, which hibernate for more than half the year and emerge during darkness to feed high in the trees.

Here, too, if you can be patient for two or three years, you need buy only an ordinary shrub. Train it on a single stem up a cane and prevent any side shoots until it has developed the shape of a standard rose tree.

ETCHED on every ambitious gardener's mind is the image of white flowers, set against dark green hedges and shown off in the cool of a summer evening. No doubt it has been deeply etched on those of you trapped in a freak European summer, where the swimming pools turned green, the children nearly suffocated, and the railway lines melted in the extreme Italian heat. Back in England, the railway lines have other problems; swimming pools will be swimming pools, but the gales and sudden coldness have not wiped out the image of pale flowers as the garden turns peacefully towards autumn.

Although not exciting, D. laureola is worth a place in the wild garden for its ability to thrive in dry shade and the limiest soils. It is a leafy evergreen that grows from 2ft to 4ft high with curling clusters of small, greenish yellow flowers which sometimes are honey scented and always appear very early in the year from February to April.

Throughout the week there have been definite signs of spring, but they mean different things in different countries. In Britain, they mean the best of the crocuses, emergent flower on brown leaved Prunus and lengthening beads of flower on my particular favourite among yellow flowered shrubs, the Stachyurus. Roses have started into leaf and if you want to ward off black spot, you must start to spray now, using Nimrod T once a fortnight on the young leaves.

Plants such as verbena, heliotrope, pelargoniums and penstemons will flower less freely from their second year onwards. All you need to keep is a parent, or perhaps two, to cover yourself against disaster.

Westwards towards Worcestershire, there are ideas by the dozen, some of which are easier to accommodate than others. Yellow Alyssum is too harsh for my taste, but there might be possibilities in imitating red Darwin tulips in grass, while the blossom on the apple trees should cause us all to regret those which had to be grubbed out soon after we entered the EC.

The drop in turnover reflected the absence of a Pounds 1m contract in 1993 to sell laundry equipment to hotels in the former Soviet Union. Mr Hazell said the profits on that contract had been so slim that the absence of the business had not affected profits.

PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) A Houston couple who decided to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary with their first foreign vacation haven't gotten the romantic island getaway they planned. I feel like I've been a hostage here, grumbled Melvin Hazel on Monday. We're eating a good meal and no one's pointing any guns at me, said his wife, Darlene, confiding: I have a lot of sense of adventure.

FT934-1952
One of the themes of Alan Ayckbourn's comedies is power: the power that some people have over others, within a tight little nexus of neighbourhood relationships. The power may be wielded generously and without malice even unconsciously; but upon those who fall under its influence its effect is terrible. In Wildest Dreams (1991), now reaching London for the first time, it is the newcomer Marcie who at once exerts her sympathetic and inquisitive influence upon a group of four people.

Before the black spot, roses had an admirable fling in that extraordinary June where everything was running at least two weeks early. I have started to notice the qualities of some of the more delicate roses which were bred in the early 1950s and are now beginning to seem old fashioned: I strongly recommend a quiet evening's research in Peter Beales' admirable reference book Classic Roses, in which he does proper justice to forgotten roses, bred in this era and kept in the trade by his nursery list, and often by no other.

THE MOST spectacular shrub in my garden for some weeks has been Mahonia Charity, a fine evergreen with long leaves composed of a number of holly like leaflets and small yellow flowers in slender spikes, themselves arranged in large, cartwheel shaped clusters. It was a chance hybrid between two wild species named M. lomariifolia and M. japonica which was picked out of a nursery bed early in the 1950s by Sir Eric Savill, who was buying plants for the Savill Garden in Windsor Great Park. When he discovered that, among his plants, he had an entirely new variety, he thought he had been very fortunate; and so he named his find Charity.
