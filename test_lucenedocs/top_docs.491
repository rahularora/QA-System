Arthur and Marion Vassmer ordered a shipment of Woodstock key chains and cigarette lighters for their general store in plenty of time for any crowds this year. It's what they didn't order 20 years ago this summer that still causes a few pangs of regret. The shelves of their country store were nearly stripped bare that August 15 17 when about a half million youngsters camped out nearly two miles away at the Woodstock music festival.

Woodstock, the rock festival that came to symbolize the 1960s for a generation of Americans, is again at the center of a controversy, this time over how big its 20th anniversary celebration should be. On one side is the Bethel Town Board, which meets tonight to discuss whether to allow voters decide what to do about next August's anniversary. If a referendum is agreed upon, it would be placed on November's ballot, Town Supervisor Alan Scott said Tuesday.

The most tension came when television reporters, nervously approaching 6 p.m. deadlines, competed for space near the commemorative plaque that is the only permanent fixture on the alfalfa field. I didn't really know what to expect, said Ralph Corwin, a resident of upstate New York who said he attended the original show and has returned every year since.

Most Woodstock anniversary revelers left the site of the 1969 concert Sunday, ending a week long celebration and leaving behind the mud and memories of yesteryear, as well as mounds of empty beer cans. Despite the lack of big name entertainers, the unsanctioned gathering swelled to 20,000 as people came to mark the 20th anniversary of the rock 'n' roll concert that has become a symbol of the '60s youth movement. Like its predecessor, the celebration of the Woodstock Music and Art Festival was mostly peaceful, but it was marred by a fight late Saturday night in which a man was stabbed.

In the spirit of the concert it's commemorating, an unofficial Woodstock reunion is slowly coming together with borrowed gear and donated services. By late Friday night cars were lining all the roads leading to the farm where 400,000 people spent three days Aug. 15 17, 1969 listening to music, getting high and enduring shortages of food, water and hygienic outlets. Unlike the original Woodstock concert, no rock stars were within miles, but thousands of people were still pouring onto the site regarded as sacred ground to those nostalgic for the rock culture of the 1960s.

Twenty years after it rocked the nation, the Woodstock festival reverberates in America's consciousness, a national poll has found.

Most Americans have heard of the three day counterculture concert, three in 10 of them wish they'd been there and nearly six in 10 say it has had a lasting effect on society, the Media General Associated Press poll found.

About 500 people marked the approaching 20th anniversary of the Woodstock music festival by camping in the rain Saturday at the late Max Yasgur's farm. A mix of original festival goers, teen agers, yuppies and remnants of the hippie days set up camp in the field nearly 75 miles northwest of New York City to mark the coming anniversary of Woodstock. Rain turned parts of the farm into mud reminiscent of the Aug. 15 17, 1969, festival, which about 400,000 people attended.

They get this picture in their minds of a gang of hippies running around, says Clearmountain, producer or mixer for Bruce Springsteen, the Pretenders and dozens of other artists. Woodstock may always be synonymous with the festival that bears its name, the last great party of the flower children before the '70s set in.

We can also place Woodstock on a descending curve of countercultural be ins, from the blissed out Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 to the bottomed out Rolling Stones concert in Altamont in December 1969.

Every other month, cemetery workers tending Jimi Hendrix's grave replace the lawn worn away by fans. Every day they take away the offerings left near his granite marker the night before: marijuana butts, lighters, guitar picks. Twenty years after Woodstock and 19 years after Hendrix admirers still come to sit and think about the young man who helped define psychedelic rock.

Soviet fans jumped, danced and wrapped themselves in giant American flags Saturday as some of heavy metal's biggest stars made their Soviet debut in Moscow's biggest ever hard rock concert. The benefit concert, a two day extravaganza billed as the Moscow Music Peace Festival and likened to the Woodstock festival of 20 years ago, features Western musicians Motley Crue, Bon Jovi, Scorpions, Cinderella, Ozzy Osbourne, and Skid Row as well as the Soviet groups Nuance, Gorky Park and Brigada S. Proceeds will go to programs that fight drug and alcohol abuse in the United States and the Soviet Union. About 100,000 fans filled the Lenin Stadium in central Moscow Saturday, many of them reclining on mats or jumping and screaming near the stage, painted in the psychedelic style of the 1960s.

Woodstock anniversary celebrants packed up and left a muddy field here, a final reminder of the rock 'n' roll festival 20 years ago that for many defined a generation. By Sunday, only about 3,500 people remained of the more than 20,000 that showed up over the last three days. The sloping alfalfa field 110 miles northwest of New York City was soaked by rain, much as it was in August 1969 when 400,000 attended the Woodstock Music and Art Festival.

A Chrysalis album, About Time, will be released in August, 15 years after their last one, and a seven week fall U.S. tour is planned. The quartet, one of the major bands to emerge from the 1960s blues revival in England, known for its fast and furious blend of blues and medium heavy rock, has not mellowed out.

Neither can remember what Ten Years After played, except for I'm Going Home, the high energy rocker used in the Woodstock movie and, they think, the jazzy I Can't Keep From Crying Sometimes and Love Like a Man. I remember we did Good Morning, Little Schoolgirl, ' Lyons said, because the tuning went out because of atmospheric conditions.

Hair bristling about her shoulders in an untidy nest, the blowsy high priestess of the blues stumbled to the stage, spitting and cursing. With two whiskey bottles in each hand, Janis Joplin faced Woodstock Nation like a drunken gunslinger. Even through her fog, she knew she didn't like this gig.

A homely soul from Port Arthur, Texas, Joplin took her talent and guts on the road and hitchhiked with her three octave voice to San Francisco just in time for the flowering of Haight Ashbury. She strutted through clubs in North Beach, and on June 11, 1966, the 23 year old whiskey soaked mama from the little Texas town joined Big Brother and The Holding Company, the house band at San Francisco's Avalon Ballroom, on stage. I couldn't believe it all that rhythm and power, Joplin later recalled.

Richie Havens is essentially an interpretive singer in the folk genre, said Rolling Stone's Anthony DeCurtis, the point being that interpretive singers in the folk genre didn't ship much platinum in the '70s and '80s. But Havens stayed alive and his number may be coming up again, in the wake of recent successes by folky artists such as Tracy Chapman.

Organizers put together the 1969 Texas International Pop Festival in Lewisville in seven weeks with a shoestring budget, but Miller Brewing Co. has pushed this weekend's concert series for more than a year with television ads and other promotions. At the shows, the psychedelic drugs of yesteryear will give way to drinking arrangements for designated drivers.

Four congressmen plan to accompany Rep. Mickey Leland's body back to the United States after it is retrieved from the wreckage of a plane crash in Ethiopia, while President Bush says he is truly saddened by this tragic accident. The president said Sunday the Texas Democrat and his 15 companions were engaged in a noble cause trying to feed the hungry when their plane crashed after taking off from Addis Ababa for a refugee camp near the Sudan border. After learning that the plane was found Sunday on a remote Ethiopian mountain 100 miles from its destination, Bush asked two White House officials to accompany a congressional team that will bring the bodies of Leland and eight other Americans back to the United States.

Postal workers who tested positive for drug use were more prone to absenteeism and getting fired, according to a new study that could give private employers an indication of the cost of workers' drug use. The analysis, one of the first studies of its kind, found that drug users had a 41 percent higher absence rate and about a 40 percent higher rate of being fired, said researcher Jacques Normand. Results suggest that by spending about $1.8 million a year to screen job applicants for drugs, the post office could avoid about $3.1 million in costs related to absenteeism and firing in the first year, he said.

Millionaire industrialist Victor Posner has decided to build five 30 story condominium buildings on his oceanfront property after rejecting a state offer for a land swap. The Florida Department of Natural Resources had been trying since March to persuade the Miami Beach executive to swap his 13 acres of oceanfront property for 67 acres of state owned land near the Doral Country Club in Miami. The Posner tract, the city's only undeveloped oceanfront land, is wedged between a strip of high rises and would have made a perfect setting for a park, state officials said.

Ten veterans, wearing their military caps, attended the meeting, and said they were upset over the vote.

Ken Voss never saw Jimi Hendrix perform live. But he's spent the 19 years since the death of the counterculture guitarist keeping his music alive for later generations. It's funny when I go on tour with Hendrix material or stage concerts devoted to his music, Voss said recently.

Curiously, Martha Bayles seems to have developed her impressions of the Woodstock Music and Arts festival and the people who attended from the very media whose romantic reminiscences she deplores in her article, Unliberating Memories (Leisure and Arts, Aug. 7). As one who attended the three day event, I was offended by her cynical characterizations of the festival goers as into romanticism, socialism and transcendence and find that her analysis serves only to further distort the already distorted collective memories of Woodstock. Along with most of those in attendance, I went for the music.
