In addition to opposition from the local people, which already has started in some areas, the government program will have to face scrutiny by private development organizations, student environmental groups, and academics who have demanded fair distribution of resources.

Companions said Soe Win, a villager kidnapped by Burmese troops, collapsed on a forced border trek, his strength sapped by lung disease and the huge load of rice and mortar shells on his back. Because he was no longer useful as a porter, they said, a soldier of the 66th Infantry Division smashed Soe Win's head against a rock half a dozen times and kicked his lifeless body down the mountainside. Two other porters said they witnessed the death and were able to escape.

BFN [Text] Thailand will accelerate the repatriation of the remaining 25,000 Hmongs and Laotians at the country's last Indochinese refugee camp at Nakhon Phanom so the camp can be closed by the end of this year. Khachatphai Burutphat, deputy secretary general of the National Security Council [NSC], told a press conference yesterday that the Thai government had no policy of allowing the settlement of any refugees and that it would try to reduce the number of border camps, with the last one holding Indochinese refugees, at Ban Na Pho in Nakhon Phanom province, to go by the end of this year. Refugee camps on the Thai Cambodian border were closed early last year when hundreds of thousands of Khmer refugees were sent home after the UN sponsored peace settlement in the war torn nation.

Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN <F P=106> [Editorial: Humanitarianism and Conditions ] </F> [Text] On Saturday Thailand was criticized by Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut after having pushed back some 20,000 Cambodian refugees from Pong Nam Ron District, Chanthaburi Province. The Cambodian foreign minister said the push back was an inhuman act because it amounted to sending these people to their deaths or to face starvation. In the middle of last week some 30,000 Cambodian civilians fled the violent fighting between the Khmer Rouge, who were defending their base in Pailin, and the attacking government forces across the border.
