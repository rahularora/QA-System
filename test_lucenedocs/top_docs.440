One of the six Philadelphia homes of author and poet Edgar Allan Poe was designated a National Literary Landmark on Sunday because of its importance in the writer's career. Jeff Collins, acting supervisory ranger at the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site, said the house is the only one remaining of Poe's houses in Philadelphia, where he lived from 1838 to 1844. Poe's time in Philadelphia is considered among his most productive, Collins said.

A mysterious man dressed in black left a half bottle of cognac and three roses on Edgar Allan Poe's grave early today in a ritual that for 41 years has marked the horror writer's birthday.

A rare first edition of Edgar Allan Poe's first book, a collection of poetry written when he was 14, is to be auctioned by Sotheby's, which calls it the most exciting book discovery in many years. In the 161 years since its publication, only 11 other copies of Tamerlane and Other Poems have been found. Published in 1827 by an obscure Boston printer when the poet, short story writer and critic was 18, it could bring as much as $300,000 at auction on June 7.

So as a character Poe was intriguing, but hardly larger than life. But his childhood loss, his childish marriage and his lifelong preoccupation with death have continued to be of interest for almost two centuries because of the sustained, morbid power of his poetry and prose. Now literary historian Kenneth Silverman has illuminated the relationship between Poe's life and art with a blend of scholarly and biographical detail as well as Freudian insight in a fascinating new book, Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never ending Remembrance (HarperCollins, 564 pages, $27.50).

Mr. Silverman, a serious researcher and writer whose other books have included a biography of Cotton Mather, clearly doesn't want to be taken as a pop psycho biographer. This biography is not an argument but a narrative, he writes, and no attempt will be made to prove' that the psychoanalytic prototype of the bereaved child applies to {Poe}. But he also recognizes that the heart of Poe's work and its continuing appeal lies in a lifelong preoccupation with his mother's death, that this prolonged mourning, an artistic brooding on motivated the artist's fantasy life.

Five or six years ago the minimalist composer Philip Glass took a break from writing monster stage pieces, to devise (with Arthur Yorinks) a chamber opera after one of Edgar Allan Poe's most famous horror tales. The Fall of the House of Usher had its premiere in Cambridge, Mass., in 1988; the following summer, Music Theatre Wales staged it at the Vale of Glamorgan Festival. Last week they revived it for the Huddersfield Festival of Contemporary Music, and it is touring southward to reach the Queen Elizabeth Hall on December 18.

Cowboy singer Rex Allen hasn't got a case against the late Slim Pickens or the actor's family or estate because of injuries he sustained at Pickens' Wyoming cabin, the state's Supreme Court ruled. The singer sued for damages for loss of sight in one eye following a 1983 fall, but the court said Friday there was no negligence on the part of Pickens. Allen slipped on overgrown grass partly covering steps to the cabin while looking for a key Pickens had at one time told him was hidden.

Allen slipped on overgrown grass partly covering steps to the cabin while looking for a key Pickens had at one time told him was hidden. At the time of the accident, Pickens was seriously ill in California. In upholding a summary judgment that had gone against Allen in lower court, the Supreme Court ruled that neither the Pickens family nor the actor's estate was responsible for maintaining the cabin for unexpected guests.

Edgar Allan Poe and Steven Berkoff: a marriage made in Heaven or perhaps for some spectators Purgatory. Both favour the wilder side; both plough their own imaginations; both choose the Gothic and place style before content. So Berkoff performing Poe's Tell Tale Heart is an awesome experience.

A man convicted of kidnapping and murdering a businessman by burying him alive in a coffin like box took the American dream ... and turned it into an Edgar Allan Poe nightmare, the prosecutor says. Assistant Attorney General Michael Ficaro is seeking the death penalty for Daniel J. Edwards, 31, of Bourbonnais, who was convicted Monday. The jury deliberated about an hour before finding Edwards guilty in the Sept. 2 abduction of Stephen Small, who suffocated while buried in a rural section of Kankakee County in northeast Illinois before his family could pay the $1 million ransom.

Disciples of fantasy horror writer H.P. Lovecraft are campaigning to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth with a hometown monument to the man who inspired a generation of spinners of creepy tales. The work of Lovecraft, an obscure pulp magazine writer in his lifetime, was rediscovered in the 1940s and he is mentioned in the same breath as Edgar Allan Poe as the forerunner of today's blockbuster authors of the macabre.

It's not going to move mountains, but it's just another way of communicating that drugs are harmful, the state judge said Monday. Before instituting the policy, Poe's probation requirements usually included regular urinalysis and drug treatment.

Poe, 32, designed the flashy costumes for The Geography of Luck, a play opening today at the downtown Los Angeles Theatre Center. Set in Las Vegas, Poe's most spectacular female get up is a Kelly green showgirl number, complete with satin, feathers, sequins and beaded headdress. Poe, who says he plans later this year to start selling his other designs in the United States, describes the Geography costume gamut as anywhere from very glitzy showgirls to white trash.

He has the reputation of being a writer's writer, most of whose novels and short stories are out of print despite the high praise of authors as distinguished as novelist Italo Calvino and poet Eugenio Montale. An Autumn Story one of Landolfi's last books, written just four years before his death in 1979 makes it easy to understand why he has sparked the enthusiasm of the few but not of the many.

A citrus industry committee on Friday asked state and federal authorities to impose a quarantine and fruit shipping restrictions around a grove infested with a virulent strain of citrus canker. The quarantine would establish a strict inspection and eradication program and restrict marketing of fruit from the grove owned by Florida Citrus Commissioner Ed Smoak. Canker is a bacterial disease that could spread and devastate Florida's billion dollar citrus industry, scientists say.

Steve Poe, a scientist representing the U.S. Department of Agriculture on the committee investigating the canker infestation, said the agency may impose a quarantine within the next two weeks. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture won't rush because the 400 acre grove is isolated and not productive, so the disease is unlikey to spread to Florida's 700,000 acres of commercial groves.
