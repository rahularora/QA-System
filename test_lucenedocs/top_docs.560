Indeed, fast growing Wal Mart, the nation's third largest retailer, already is threatening to overtake K mart by outdoing it at the discount game.

Sports Illustrated Classic is the latest example of Time Warner's attempt to build new magazines based on existing titles, rather than starting from scratch. But even as Time Warner is extending the Sports Illustrated name, it's unclear how successful the company has been with similar attempts recently. Last year, Time launched Sports Illustrated for Kids, which has built a circulation of 850,000, but it won't be profitable until 1992, company executives said.

The holiday promotion is tied to a central theme that will be reinforced with store signs, print and broadcast advertising and a new song sung by Kenny Rogers, who stars in the TV show. Retailers usually pull out all the stops to pump up Christmas sales because the season generates about half of their annual profits.

K mart Corp., the nation's second largest retailer, Monday reported a 22 percent decline in quarterly earnings caused mainly by lower than anticipated sales, increased costs and higher advertising expenses. The sluggish sales at K mart stores partially reflected consumer interest in a heavily advertised new low price policy at rival retailer Sears, Roebuck and Co., an analyst said. K mart reported it earned $94.1 million, or 47 cents a share, for the quarter ended April 26, down from $120.8, or 60 cents a share, during the same period a year ago.

Executives at retailer R.H. Macy &amp; Co. made a smart move this past week while their Campeau Corp. counterparts scrambled to come up with cash to keep their department stores running. They publicly reassured backers who had put money into Macy's debt financed buyout in 1986 that their investment was doing just fine. Instead of ignoring the situation, Macy's tried to deflect the shock waves rippling through the retail industry since Campeau dropped a bombshell in disclosing a severe cash shortage.

NBC and CBS are going shopping for viewers next fall at two of the nation's biggest retail outlets. Both networks are hooking up with retailers in ambitious promotions that will tout the new television season that starts in September through a combination of games, store displays, TV and newspaper ads and direct mail. The alliances between NBC and Sears, Roebuck and Co. and between CBS and K mart Corp. are the latest efforts by the networks to halt the erosion of their audience to cable, independent TV outlets and video tapes.

Leading department stores say their newspaper advertising spending will be flat this fall, bad news for publishers who have been hurt by a slowdown in retail ad expenditures that has lasted more than a year. The dreary prognosis is doubly disappointing because some observers have been expecting that recent strength in apparel sales and aggressive back to school merchandising would boost retail ad spending. However, doubts about the economy, coupled with cost cutting strategies now in place in many retail chains, have dimmed those hopes.

Retail advertising has been especially weak in print, which accounts for about 85% of all ad spending. In newspapers, retailers of all kinds reduced their ad spending by 8% to $7.54 billion in the first six months compared with a year ago, the Newspaper Advertising Bureau says. In consumer magazines and Sunday newspaper magazines, spending by department and specialty stores fell 18% to $106.7 million in the first half, according to Leading National Advertisers, an industry research company.
