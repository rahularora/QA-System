NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle is threatening legal action, saying such a betting game would harm the integrity of professional football. Boosters of the game say it would tap a new audience for the Oregon Lottery and could be used to raise money for college sports programs.

In the last 10 years, the number of major football helmet companies has dropped from 18 to three because of lawsuits over helmet safety, Mrs. Nimmons said. The other major manufacturer is BSN Corp. That trend has helped drive helmet prices higher, said John Horan, editor of Sporting Goods Management News. A coach is probably paying $120 for a helmet that, taking away the insurance and given a competitive situation, would probably cost a fraction of that, Horan said.

Mr. Sullivan, longtime owner of the Patriots, filed suit in federal court in Providence, R.I., charging that in 1987, the NFL unfairly prevented him from selling a 49% stake in his team to an investment bank that would have resold interests to the public. Mr. Sullivan says he was blocked because of an NFL rule that prohibits selling any interest in an NFL team to any company not involved in the business of professional football. In the suit he says that's a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

This sends a clear signal to everyone that the leagues have the authority and the responsibility to control franchise relocation in most cases, said Steven Ross, a former Justice Department attorney who teaches sports law at the University of Illinois. The decision of where to locate a franchise would be up to the league. If the league abuses its power, it should then be scrutinized by the court, he said.

Birren, general counsel for the Los Angeles Raiders, agreed, adding that the Clippers tried to turn our case into a per se victory for any team that wants to move.

A federal judge rejected the U.S. Football League's effort to carve out a niche on network television, thus closing the books on the initial trial phase of the league's $1.69 billion antitrust suit against the National Football League. The USFL, which received only $1 in damages in the trial, had filed a motion for injunctive relief based on the jury's finding that the NFL monopolizes professional football in the U.S. A motion for a new trial also was denied. But in his ruling, Judge Peter K. Leisure noted that the jury's monopoly finding was limited strictly to the market for professional football; the six person jury specifically ruled that the NFL didn't monopolize the TV market.

By contrast, NFL owners propose that players become eligible for free agency after two years (as it was in the last agreement) but that teams would still receive some compensation for losing players under a complicated formula. Some examples: Player's Annual Salary: $120,000 Years of Service: 4 years Current System: Player's former team receives third round draft choice Owner's Proposal: Player's former team only has first refusal rights* Players' Proposal: Former team receives no compensation Player's Annual Salary: $210,000 Years of Service: 7 years Current System: Player's former team receives first round draft choice Owner's Proposal: Player's former team receives fifth round draft choice Players' Proposal: Former team receives no compensation Player's Annual Salary: $450,000 Years of Service: 10 years Current System: Player's former team receives two first round draft choices Owner's Proposal: Player's former team receives one first round and one second round draft choice Players' Proposal: Former team receives no compensation *Under the owners' proposal, a free agent's current team would retain the right of first refusal, the ability to match the salary offer of another team under certain conditions of salary and years of service. The players want to eliminate first refusal rights.

The National Football League criticized the District of Columbia on Thursday for a planned lottery that would allow residents to bet on professional teams and said it will consider suing the city. NFL spokesman Joe Browne said the league opposes gambling legalized or otherwise and would review the lottery and explore its options, including litigation. With increased betting on sports, the nature of fans would change and they would become more concerned about winning bets than seeing their team win a game, said Browne.

The NFL Players Union complains that, in the league's system of free agency, players are little more than chattel property of NFL owners. First, it argues, the league conducts a draft of college seniors, granting each of its 28 franchises exclusive rights to the players selected. Then when a player's contract with a particular club expires, he may offer his talents to other teams, but his original club has the right to match any rival offers.

The National Football League's new $1.43 billion television contract is expected to help bolster network profits, but it is a gamble for ESPN Inc. The NFL said it has approved a new three year contract with CBS Inc., National Broadcasting Co. and Capital Cities/ABC Inc. for rights to air NFL games. The NFL also agreed to sell rights for 13 games to ESPN, a 24 hour cable sports programming service that is 80% owned by Capital Cities/ABC.

Mr. Grimes says ESPN's cost to advertisers of $10 to $11 per thousand viewers will be comparable to ABC's. ESPN officials hope that because it plans to sell only 60% of the games' commercial time itself 36 half minute spots national advertisers will be standing in line to get the limited time. But some advertising agency officials argue that it may be difficult to draw a big audience to a third Sunday football slot that competes against the networks' prime time schedules.

Are we a nation governed by laws or judges? While the issues of this great debate are complex, one cannot deny an unfortunate tendency of many federal judges to decide cases based on personal policy preferences. This is well illustrated in antitrust cases challenging the draft and reserve rules of professional sports leagues.

Now, former Watergate investigator Philip Heymann has been named to look into charges that New England Patriots' players exposed themselves and made suggestive remarks to Olson on Sept. 17.

Does the National Football League's enormously successful television recipe need to be spiced up? For nearly two decades, the NFL has mixed a shot of CBS, a dash of ABC and a pinch of NBC to brew a very rich alphabet soup. The last contract for broadcast rights, for example, a five year pact that expired after the Super Bowl last month, brought in $2.1 billion from the networks.

The networks, which reportedly lost as much as $75 million broadcasting NFL games last year, have been seeking lower fees in light of a softer sports advertising market and declining viewership of games. To make up lost network revenue, the league is also expected to announce a fourth rights package with a cable concern, possibly ESPN Inc., Time Inc.'s Home Box Office unit, or Cable Football Network, a consortium of cable companies. ESPN, a cable sports television service, is 80% owned by Capital Cities/ABC.
