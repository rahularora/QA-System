I feel that our ridership is very high, said Greyhound spokeswoman Elizabeth Hale, who said ridership had been hovering between 50% and 60% of pre strike levels in the days immediately preceding the holiday. She attributed the lower percentage over the Easter weekend itself mainly to the fact that in 1989, Easter coincided with spring break for many college students. But analysts who follow the closely held company's publicly traded bonds say Greyhound has yet to maintain the levels of ridership and revenue that it needs to break even.
