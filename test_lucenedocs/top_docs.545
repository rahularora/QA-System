Forty years ago, when the late songwriter Johnny Marks penned his first draft of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, he was unhappy with it so unhappy he thought it was the worst song he ever wrote. In fact, Marks' dissatisfaction was such that he put the song aside and didn't get back to it until the following year. But in 1949, while humming the melody during a walk near his home in New York's Greenwich Village, the composer hit upon a solution: Instead of having the notes in the unsatisfactory opening bars dropping down the scale, he reversed the progression and had them go up.

They must be original, easy to sing, easy to remember, sexless so that a man or woman could perform them and should have attention getting titles. But most important, Berlin stated, The song writer must look upon his work as a business, that is, to make a success of it, he must work and work, and then WORK.

Like any quick thinking kid, Berlin was looking for an angle, a gimmick some way to grab onto a trend and seized on ragtime as the answer. But he was also willing to take chances, play with the rules and invent the rules. Alexander's Ragtime Band, the name inspired by the derogatorially named coon songs that had Alexander in the title, combined popular black and white music, mixing ragtime and march.

It wasn't a White Christmas, but dozens of fans who usually sing Christmas carols to composer Irving Berlin serenaded him at his mansion today at the very start of his 100th birthday. The reclusive composer, who hates to get up in the morning and wrote a song to that effect, didn't put in an appearance. If he's 100, he's probably sleeping, said Roberta Kaufman, who had been walking her dog and stopped to see what the crowd of 75 people was doing in front of the five story brick mansion in Beekman Place, an exclusive East Side enclave.

With America facing the possibility of another war and the unbound optimism of the 1980s becoming threadbare, the late Phil Ochs' songs carry the same bite today as they did two decades ago. And they're getting wider play again, at least in the East. Verses such as So young so strong so ready for the war, so willing to go and die upon a foreign shore, from One More Parade, could just as easily be a lament about soldiers marching off to the Persian Gulf as Southeast Asia.

He caught the voices of the people early in this century and held them for longer than anyone else, Robert Kimball, musical theater historian, said Friday. From his first song, Marie of Sunny Italy, in 1907 to his last Broadway show, Mr. President, in 1962, Berlin's presence was felt on the music scene in this country. No one today can look to such a long period of domination.

He found success not only in Tin Pan Alley but on Broadway with musicals like Annie Get Your Gun, Call Me Madam and his Music Box revues, and in Hollywood where he wrote the scores for Fred Astaire Ginger Rogers movies like Top Hat and Follow the Fleet and other films like Holiday Inn and Easter Parade.

It was a stirring, emotional, and perhaps historic procession: Leonard Bernstein, Frank Sinatra, Isaac Stern, Tony Bennett, Ray Charles, Marilyn Horne, Jule Styne, Hal Davis, Sammy Cahn, Irving Caesar, Burton Lane, the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts and the Army.

In the book Sea Power of the State, Gorshkov said the Soviet navy's development of a fleet of submarines and missile launching warships had frustrated illusory hopes of imperialist aggressors that in the sphere of armed conflict at sea they would have no strong opponent.
