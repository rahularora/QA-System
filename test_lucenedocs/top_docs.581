But 100 years later, he is unarguably the world's most popular painter. He enjoyed considerable acclaim among his fellow artists during the late 1800s, and his influence was felt long after his death in 1890.

Police hunting burglars who stole three Vincent van Gogh paintings said Tuesday they are hampered by the size of the scene of the crime: a museum surrounded by the country's biggest national park. Karel van Seventer said, however, the police's rapid response apparently stopped the thieves taking a fourth painting by the 19th century Dutch impressionist master. Weaver's Interior, which Seventer earlier identified as one of the stolen works, was found lying on the floor of the room from which the other three had disappeared, he said.

The newly discovered work, which has been in the possession of a Wisconsin family for about 30 years, was sent to Amsterdam by Leslie Hindman Auctioneers for examination. ; The painting was first identified as a van Gogh by John Kuhn, a commercial real estate agent who works part time as an art prospector for Hindman. He said he spotted the painting last July on the wall of the owners' suburban Milwaukee home while he was examining antique furniture there.

Three early oil paintings by 19th century Dutch master Vincent van Gogh have been stolen from a small provincial museum in this southern town, the third theft in two years of Van Gogh works. The paintings taken Wednesday night from the Noordbrabants Museum were identified by the museum as The Sitting Farmer's Wife , The Digging Farmer's Wife and Wheels of the Water Mill in Gennep . Guy Jennings, an Impressionism expert at Christie's auction house in London, said by telephone that such minor works by Van Gogh are worth about $1 million each but would be virtually impossible to sell on the open market.

The works, whose combined worth has been estimated at up to $52 million, were recovered undamaged, he told The Associated Press.

It took 20 minutes for police to arrive on the scene of the burglary reportedly because the museum's private security company failed to immediately alert authorities.

A painting of vivid yellow and orange flowers in a dark vase, hanging on a faded wall of a little known museum on the Nile, is an original work by Vincent van Gogh, French experts say. It is real, absolutely real, without doubt, Francoise Cachin, director of Paris' Musee d'Orsay, told a news conference Saturday. The one foot square canvas is among 350 paintings and other art works at the Mohammed Mahmoud Khalil Museum, which houses the private collection of an Egyptian senator donated to the state by his widow in 1960.

It was the biggest art theft in Dutch history. The burglars broke a ground floor window before dawn in the museum's north wing, which is relatively sheltered from public view, said museum spokesman Maarten Bertheux.

The price far exceeds the previous record of $39.9 million paid for van Gogh's Sunflowers last March in London, proving again that art and stock have little in common. The crowd in the packed sale room cheered and applauded wildly as the final price was reached.

Vincent van Gogh's melancholy portrait of the doctor who treated him in the weeks before his suicide sold at auction for $82.5 million, making it by far the most expensive painting in the world. The sale Tuesday of Portrait of Dr. Gachet came after a 10 minute bidding war at Christie's auction house between two buyers who jacked up the price in increments of $1 million. The 26 by 22.5 inch oil was worth $141,000 per square inch to Kobayashi Gallery of Tokyo, which has emerged in recent years as a major buyer of Impressionist art.

Many art specialists consider the iris painting more beautiful and important than the sunflower and bridge paintings, and in better condition than the sunflower work. A Japanese insurance company, Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine, bought the sunflowers in London, and for Japanese buyers the dollar is an even bigger bargain today than the British pound was then. The auction is of more than academic interest, because it is likely to offer further evidence that the world art market has become as integrated as the financial markets.

Artists, unlike cowards, die many times after their deaths. And the world record for posthumous dying is doubtless held by Vincent van Gogh. His suicide in July 1890 has not only been reenacted by Irving Stone and Kirk Douglas, it has also been celebrated in verse and in song, been described and analyzed by historians, physicians, psychologists and philosophers, and been invoked in countless museum galleries and lecture halls.

In keeping with its policy of not discussing details of private acquisitions, the museum will not be disclosing the price of the work, the Getty said in a statement.

The painting, characteristic of van Gogh's bold style, represents a patch of garden in a French asylum at Saint Remy de Provence, where the troubled artist committed himself following a mental breakdown in Arles. This is among the most original and dynamic of all van Gogh's compositions, in which the spearlike, slashing representation of the flowers is echoed by the vibrancy of color, said George Goldner, the Getty's curator of paintings and drawings.

At the same time it is a picture of great poetry, as expressed in the one white iris on the left side which, in its isolation, has a special poignancy.

Police used an undercover agent posing as a prospective buyer today to recover three 19th century masterpieces, including works by Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cezanne. All three paintings taken from Amsterdam's Municipal Museum last month were recovered undamaged, according to police spokesman Klaas Wilting. The paintings, valued at up to $52 million, were seized when police raided a hotel and arrested a 36 year old man who was selling them for $1.14 million, Wilting said.

Museum director Wim Beeren said when the paintings were stolen that they are so famous it would be almost impossible to sell them on the open market. He speculated they were stolen on commission by a private collector. The three works were only insured for fire damage, but Beeren said at the time the huge loss estimate was due in part to the record prices paid for recently auctioned van Goghs.
