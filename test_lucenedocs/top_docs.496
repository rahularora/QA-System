Toni Morrison felt kind of a redemption when she won the Pulitzer Prize in fiction for her spellbinding and searing song of slavery, Beloved. I thought it was quite possible that the value of the book would not be allowed to be the only consideration that the (Pulitzer) committee would have to consider, and that saddened me, Morrison said Thursday. The editor, playwright and author had been the epicenter of a literary earthquake and controversy.

In a biographical note she wrote for an earlier work, Miss Morrison reported that she first started to set stories down on paper years earlier, when she was teaching at Howard University and her marriage to the father of her two children was breaking up: I wrote like someone with a dirty habit. Secretly, compulsively, slyly.

About the fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh revisions I began to see the authority and maybe the surrender.

When the American baritone William Parker found his career, as well as his body, ravaged by the Aids virus, he again turned to song and conceived the idea for The AIDS Quilt Songbook. He commissioned from leading composers and poets a still growing collection of songs that, like the panels in the Names Project quilt, remember individuals who have died of Aids. Like the quilt's panels, the Songbook songs are performed in whatever configuration best suits an occasion.

Julius Lester has written 19 books, many for children. His early works include a paean hymn to black power. His latest book, Lovesong, caused an academic uproar and his exile from the Afro American studies department at the University of Massachusetts.

Julius Lester wrote the book on black power in 1968 with a title he meant to be funny: Look Out, Whitey! Black Power's Gon' Get Your Mama! The title, however, was taken seriously by at least one newspaper, which headlined the story: White Mamas in Danger, Says Black Militant.

More crucially, her sombre conclusion that racism 'is as healthy as it was during the Enlightenment', its utility as a metaphor having outstripped its ideological purpose in justifying economic exploitation, lays down a challenge to others to share her own project as a writer: to 'free up' the language from the 'sinister, lazy, predictable racial codes' that pervade and impoverish it.

It requires a special talent to take an obscure wedding dance by Edvard Grieg and turn it into a Hit Parade smash like Strange Music or transform the exotic themes of Borodin into songs like Stranger in Paradise and Baubles, Bangles and Beads. For much of their careers, George Forrest and Robert Wright have used that talent, adapting someone else's music, usually a classical composer, and spinning it into something new. They did it in Hollywood, working on dozens of films like Maytime, Sweethearts and I Married an Angel, and on Broadway with shows like Song of Norway, Magdalena and Kismet.

IT WOULD be a great pity if the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to the black American novelist Toni Morrison were to be seen as merely another gesture of political correctness because it rewards the work of a courageous writer who has charted new territory for the modern novel in a hard clear prose that has the resonance of poetry. The picture we get of the lives of black people in America from a novel like Beloved (1987) serves as a vivid and moving corrective to the world depicted by Harriet Beecher Stowe in Uncle Tom's Cabin. Morrison gives us slavery as it really was, the beatings and rapings, the cruel use of leg irons and mouth clamps, the interminable punishments imposed for trivial offences.

Admiral Sergei Gorshkov, the man credited with turning the Soviet Union into a modern naval power, died Friday at age 78, Tass said. Gorshkov was appointed to head the Soviet navy in 1956 by Nikita S. Khrushchev, who considered Josef Stalin's emphasis on large surface vessels impractical because of their vulnerability to rocket attacks. In the book Sea Power of the State, Gorshkov said the Soviet navy's development of a fleet of submarines and missile launching warships had frustrated illusory hopes of imperialist aggressors that in the sphere of armed conflict at sea they would have no strong opponent.

EDITOR'S NOTE The man who created gospel music is as obscure as his music is popular. Thomas Dorsey is now 88 and bedridden in his Chicago home. A handful of gospel devotees are working to build a foundation that would preserve both his music and his memory.
 AP880307-0214 
More than half a century ago, Thomas Dorsey crossed the raw soulfulness of the blues with the sacred music of his youth to create a foot stomping, soul slapping sound that still fills black churches. A personal conflict over his strict religious upbringing and love of the bawdy, bluesy tunes inspired by slave songs led the young jazz pianist to create what he called gospel music. Now 88, bedridden in his Chicago home and suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Dorsey is in danger of dying in obscurity, his legend unknown by a generation of worshippers who revere his music but don't know his name.

Casino Paradise, set in an unspecified time and era, is about a gangster tycoon, J.J. Ferguson (Timothy Nolen), who buys up a seaside town and brings in gambling, winning over its inhabitants with blackmail and transparent promises that as he gets richer, they will too. He is opposed by his confused, quasi countercultural son, Stanley (Eddie Korbich), whose motives stem as much from hatred of his father as from sympathy for the little guy, and adored by his greedy and equally confused daughter, Cis (Janet Metz). An ensemble of weak willed townspeople/gamblers wavers between J.J. and Stanley.

Stormie Jones, the world's first heart liver transplant recipient, remained in fair condition Monday two weeks after her second liver transplant. Doctors said the 12 year old girl's condition was upgraded from serious to fair Sunday at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Stormie, of White Settlement, Texas, received a new heart and liver at Children's on Feb. 14, 1984, to control a condition in which her cholesterol level was 10 times higher than normal.

Watching the new movie, Imagine: John Lennon, was very painful for the late Beatle's wife, Yoko Ono.

Imagine is more than a Lennon elegy. Though it fails to delve too deeply into the darker side of Lennon and the Beatles (drug use, abusive tempers, manager Brian Epstein's death), it does capture the music and the times in which Lennon lived. One intriguing episode in Imagine shows cartoonist Al Capp ( L'il Abner ) being antagonistic toward the Lennons during their bed in, when they stayed in bed for a week to publicize their concern for peace.

It's nice to be in the World Almanac permanently, said Boston University historian Robert V. Bruce, who won the Pulitzer in history for his book, The Launching of Modern Science 1846 1876. Toni Morrison, winner of the fiction award for Beloved, said joy was uppermost in her feelings because, I really was thinking dark and difficult thoughts about what was available to this book in terms of recognition.

Aaron Copland, the pioneering composer who used folk songs and jazz in writing plainspoken classics such as Appalachian Spring, Lincoln Portrait and Billy the Kid, died Sunday at age 90. Copland, who lived in Peekskill, died at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Westchester from pneumonia with respiratory failure following two recent strokes, hospital spokeswoman Ann Marie Treanor said Sunday night. Admired by colleagues as the dean of American music, Copland was a major force in gaining international recognition for the nation's 20th century composers.

John Wallowitch is a sophisticated sprite of Manhattan, an impish composer, pianist and cabaret performer who celebrates New York and chronicles its often bizarre customs and mores. He sings the music of Gershwin, Porter, Kern, Rodgers and Berlin too, but he also performs his own compositions, usually songs about Manhattan filtered through the sensibilities of the 1960s, '70s and '80s. He can lament the loneliness of big city life in I Live Alone Again, laugh at growing old in I'm 27, or luxuriate in the pleasures of high living in Back on the Town.
