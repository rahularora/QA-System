A federal judge ruled today that portions of a 1952 law allowing deportation of aliens for advocating world communism are unconstitutional because they violate immigrants' First Amendment rights. U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson also threw out a congressional exception to a subsequent law, which gave free speech rights to all immigrants except members of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Congress, he said, already has passed sufficient laws dealing with terrorism and his decision didn't diminish the government's power to deport aliens for reasons unrelated to their speech.

A federal judge on Thursday struck down portions of a 1952 law allowing the government to deport aliens for espousing anti American beliefs, saying the provisions violate immigrants' free speech rights. U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson also threw out an exception to a 1987 law that recognized free speech rights for all immigrants in deportation proceedings but members of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Wilson said Congress already has passed a powerful array of laws dealing with terrorism and his decision would not significantly deplete the government's arsenal in combating terrorism.

Although it is only an early step in the legislative process, the subcommittee action was significant. The legislation would amend the McCarran Ferguson Act of 1945, which has provided the $500 billion insurance industry with broad protection from federal antitrust enforcement. Only once before, in 1988, has such a modification of McCarran Ferguson received subcommittee approval, and that bill died without moving further.

Airports have fallen behind in providing creature comforts, and they're going to catch up in the next five years, says Steven Reiss, the Alexandria, Va. based airport design director for HNTB, a Kansas City, Mo., architectural and engineering firm. Nintendo games, rental movies and exercise clubs will become common at airports, he predicts. Moreover, with airline delays increasing what is known as passenger dwell time in terminals, it is in the financial self interest of airports to serve up appealing distractions.

The first announced nuclear weapon test of 1988 rocked the Nevada desert Monday and sent a shudder through some high rise buildings in Las Vegas, 105 miles from ground zero. The device produced an explosive punch up to 11 times as powerful as the atomic bomb that devastated Hiroshima. The test was conducted three weeks after a team of Soviet nuclear scientists visited the top secret Nevada Test Site a visit that could lead to the monitoring of each other's tests and a possible test ban.

And it came the same day the second round of U.S. Soviet negotiations on nuclear testing began in Geneva with the Soviets calling for agreement by June on anti cheating provisions. That would permit ratification of two superpower treaties limiting the yield of test blasts. The test, code named Kernville, was delayed two hours because of unfavorable wind conditions, then another 10 minutes because of technical problems, according to Department of Energy spokeswoman Barbara Yoerg.

A plane that crashed into a foggy mountaintop, killing a Las Vegas church leader and eight family members on a holiday trip to Disneyland, failed to clear the ridge by less than 200 feet, authorities said. The wreckage of the chartered twin engine Cessna 402 was found Monday near the top of a 2,270 foot ridge overlooking Hagador Canyon in the Santa Ana Mountains of Southern California. The plane crashed Sunday, scattering bodies and debris over a 100 yard area in the Cleveland National Forest 45 miles southeast of Los Angeles.

A company that started building a $60 million, magnetically levitated passenger rail system in Las Vegas has abandoned the project, leaving behind concrete track pillars and an unfinished station. Magnetic Transit of America Inc. cited financial difficulties and reasons beyond our control for pulling out of the elevated rail project Thursday. It has become increasingly evident that termination is the only responsible business decision to be made, said MTA President John Kapala.

Lawyers for the states and other legal experts said the ruling marked a significant change in the way the courts have interpreted the McCarran Act's key provisions. ; The appeals court said insurers lose their antitrust exemption when they work in concert with foreign insurers or with other companies not covered by the act to fix prices or control the market. ; And it said that in this case the insurers had lost their antitrust exemption by organizing a boycott by reinsurers of insurance companies that were balking at changes the defendants were seeking in the way liability insurance is sold.

A nuclear weapons test rocked the Nevada desert today, registering 5.6 on the Richter scale and causing a swaying motion in high rise buildings here, 100 miles from ground zero. John Minsch, a spokesman for the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said the reading indicated the test was one of the larger ones conducted at the desert site. The device was detonated 40 miles from Mercury, a tiny town on the Nevada Test Site where Soviet nuclear scientists are based while preparing for a joint U.S. Soviet test next month.

They argue the industry increasingly is faced with competition from other financial service businesses that are, at least in part, federally regulated. Furthermore, it is far from certain that the national and increasingly international scope of the industry can be dealt with adequately by 50 different state regulators. On the other hand, those who believe more federal regulation is needed ignore the fact that some federal regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, have demonstrated no more independence or competence in dealing with complex financial issues than have state insurance regulators.

Federal Trade Commission Chairman Daniel Oliver's call for repealing the insurance industry's longstanding exemption from federal antitrust laws signals tougher Reagan administration oversight of insurance companies. The Justice Department also has decided to endorse or at least not try to block such legislation, according to administration officials and a draft version of testimony to be presented to a Senate Judiciary subcommittee tomorrow. The moves will provide a boost for legislation repealing the McCarran Ferguson Act, which exempts the industry from most federal antitrust regulation.

The insurance industry is so protected by a federal antitrust exemption that a few executives are able to exercise immense control over rates and who should receive liability insurance, the Texas attorney general told a Senate panel. The leaders of the property and casualty insurance industry meet constantly to discuss their profits, their losses and their objectives for the future, Jim Mattox told the Senate antitrust committee on Tuesday. They sit aroud the table in the board rooms of ISO (Insurance Services Office) and they do what no other industry can do by meeting together, talking together, planning together, strategizing together and I might say, conspiring together, he said.

An American Bar Association study panel on Tuesday recommended federal regulation of the insurance industry. The 12 member ABA commission called for repeal of the 43 year old McCarran Ferguson Act, in which Congress generally left insurance regulation to the states. The commission, in a 183 page report, also urged that an agency with subpoena powers investigate whether improper industry collusion manipulates insurance availability and cost.

Atkins and the American Civil Liberties Union said Tuesday.
