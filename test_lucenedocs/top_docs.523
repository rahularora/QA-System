Archaeologists say the tombs of a mysterious city have yielded the first example of the use on children of an ancient art: carving or engraving teeth as a sign of beauty. Evidence of the engraving was discovered on the teeth of a young boy's skeleton found in the ruins of Montezuma's Balcony, whose civilization was far more advanced than any previously thought to exist in the region. Montezuma's Balcony is 310 miles north of Mexico City outside Ciudad Victoria, capital of northeastern Tamaulipas state.

Hundreds of U.S. and Mexican firefighters on Sunday battled fires that burned thousands of acres of brush and timber on both sides of the border and raced across an Apache Indian reservation, officials said. A forest fire that started in Mexico charred 6,000 acres, about 3,500 on the U.S. side of the border near Nicksville, and damaged two structures in a park picnic area, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Jim Payne in Phoenix. The blaze, which Payne called a raging monster out of control, also had threatened ranch homes in the Coronado National Monument, about 50 miles south of Tucson, before they were saved by crews who started backfires.

The levies were challenged by Cotton Petroleum Inc., which also pays taxes to the tribe for the extracted minerals. Today's ruling is a substantial and rather profound victory for the state of New Mexico, said Gov.

The Supreme Court ruled today that states may tax companies for oil and gas taken from Indian reservations. Voting 6 3, the justices handed Western states an important victory in upholding a New Mexico tax on oil and gas taken from the Jicarilla Apache reservation there. The court said the state levy does not trample on Indian rights and is not unfair to a petroleum company even though the company must pay taxes to the state and the tribe.

Judging from Tony Hillerman's books, you might think he's Navajo, and many Navajos are surprised to learn he's not. That's because Hillerman has captured American Indian cultures, particularly Navajo, as no other novelist. In 1987, he was given a Special Friend of the Navajo award to go with his Edgar Allan Poe Award for best mystery of 1973, Dance Hall of the Dead.

We're winding down, said U.S. Bureau of Land Management spokesman Gordon Warren. In eastern Utah, crews began going home after the 4,500 acre Ryan Creek fire near the Colorado line was contained Wednesday evening. Firefighters extinguished two other fires that burned nearly 18,000 acres, but officials still battled a 100 acre fire in steep terrain in Desolation Canyon.

The parents of two young people who disappeared last year in New Mexico said Tuesday that a mysterious photograph found in a Florida parking lot appears to show their children, bound and gagged. Michael Henley, now 10, vanished on a turkey hunt with his father in April 1988 in the mountains south of their hometown of Milan, N.M. Tara Calico, now 20, disappeared five months later while bicycling on a country road near her hometown of Belen, N.M. Michael's parents and Ms. Calico's mother flew to this Florida Panhandle city to meet with police Tuesday. The mystery photo was found June 15 in a store lot where a white van had been parked, but the parents did not learn about it until the picture was shown Friday on the nationally syndicated television show A Current Affair.

A FEROCIOUS row over who leaked the name of the sick child whose case was a model for Labour's controversial political broadcast last Tuesday drove other general election issues off the agenda yesterday. Amid scenes of near pandemonium in the camps of both main parties, the Conservatives and Labour vied repeatedly to take the high moral ground by charging their opponents with cynically abusing a family's privacy for their own political ends. But after a series of increasingly acrimonious and rowdy news conferences which first put Labour on the defensive, the day ended with the Tories in the spotlight when Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, conceded that party officials had 'helped the consultant' at the centre of the case to contact a newspaper.

Firefighters mopped up blazes in five other Western states. The Gila trout, lured into a clear section of Diamond Creek a day earlier, were collected along a three quarter mile stretch and put in holding tanks on the sides of mules or horses to be taken eventually to an Apache fish hatchery.

The netted fish were to be transported in 250 gallon aerated tanks aboard two trucks to a hatchery run by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs on the Mescalero Apache Reservation in south central New Mexico, said Ms. Garcia. She said the fish are fairly hardy.

Relatives of two New Mexico youths who vanished last year said Sunday they're pretty sure their children were shown gagged in a mysterious photograph that appeared on national television last week. The tabloid television news show A Current Affair broadcast Friday in New Mexico had a segment on the mystery picture, a Polaroid snapshot found June 15 in the Florida Panhandle city of Port St. Joe. The relatives of Tara Calico and Michael Henley Jr. believe the picture is the first evidence that the missing youths are still alive, perhaps in captivity in Florida.

The outcome is likely to be important to Western states seeking guidance on what power they have over tribal resources. Cotton Petroleum challenged taxes on oil and gas taken from some 15,000 acres of land on the Jicarilla Apache reservation in New Mexico. The company pays taxes to the tribe amounting to about 6 percent of its production and New Mexico levies five taxes on the company amounting to 8 percent of its production.
