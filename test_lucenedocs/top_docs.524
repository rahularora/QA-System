Your Aug. 9 Asides ACLU Defends Satanism states that a coven of witches in Rhode Island was able, via the assistance of the ACLU, to obtain tax status as a legitimate religious body. This obviously piqued your editorial ire. If you had bothered to do your research, you would know that witchcraft (also known as Wicca) is recognized by, among others, the U.S. armed forces as a legitimate religious practice.

For the past two years, the American Civil Liberties Union, citing freedom of religion concerns, has provided Ms. Fox with free legal services in the zoning dispute, which still isn't resolved. Ms. Fox's farm straddles hills that were bypassed by glaciers in the Ice Age. Craggy rock formations held spiritual powers, according to Indian tribes that once roamed the area.

EDITOR'S NOTE To hear some of them tell it, there are more witches in North America than you can shake a broom at. One of them is an American who emigrated to Canada, a high priest of Wicca who is campaigning for witches' rights. Among other things, he wants a license to perform weddings.

He's a Vietnam veteran who spends quiet evenings watching Cary Grant movies and would like to be reincarnated as Fred Astaire. But Charles Arnold is also Canada's most visible witch, a second degree high priest of Wicca, the religion of witchcraft. I don't melt if water is poured over me, says the 40 year old clerical worker who is campaigning for legal acceptance of his beliefs in both a male and female divinity, the potency of magic and absence of original sin.

Arnold complained that the Marriage Act discriminates against Canada's 5,000 witches by making it a crime, punishable by up to six months in jail, to perform an unauthorized wedding. They should either license me or do away with the law altogether, he said, noting that Wiccan weddings are permitted in 38 U.S. states.

It must have a litany or system of prayer, as well as specific doctrines and practices that its members are expected to follow. Clark said the connotation of witches may have made it more difficult for the state.

Tax Administrator R.

THREE HUNDRED years ago on Tuesday an execution took place at Gallows Hill near Salem Village, Massachusetts, which has since haunted America's national consciousness. Seven women and a man were hanged for witchcraft, mainly on the evidence of a group of village girls who were apparently suffering fits and seizures after experimenting with the occult. These victims turned down the chance to save their lives by confessing their guilt.

And one of the best preserved chambers is on the property of longtime resident John Murray. Partially covered by an earthen mound, the chamber is about 5 foot 8 inches high, 6 feet wide and 15 feet long. Whoever built it made good use of local materials: Small rocks are stacked in the carefully balanced arch of a corbeled vault, three enormous shingled slabs form the roof and a couple more serve as the doorway and lintel.

The priestess of the Church of the Most High Goddess, who wears a red sequin strapless dress and fishnet stockings, insists sex with hundreds of men is her religious duty, but a jury says it's prostitution. Known as Sabrina Aset to her flock, Mary Ellen Tracy says she takes part in an ancient, misunderstood Egyptian religion in which sexual rituals put men on the path back to the divine. But a Superior Court jury wasn't convinced, deciding after 3{ days of deliberations Friday that Mrs. Tracy, 46, was no more than a prostitute working out of a Beverly Hills home that was a thinly disguised brothel.

Several schools have canceled traditional Halloween costume parties, opting to hold fall and harvest celebrations instead. Other schools are bypassing Halloween altogether, asking children to dress up as storybook characters in conjunction with National Children's Book Week in mid November.

The city likes to be remembered as the former seat of the House of Savoy dynasty, the first capital of a unified Italy, the resting place of saints and religious relics, the home of the Fiat auto empire.

If the Supreme Court rules to adopt such a test, it alone cannot be blamed for infusing a newly religious tone into its rulemaking. Some citizens are intent on inducing Solomonic decisions from the justices on the most ethically fraught, spiritually sensitive issues of the times. The conservative sweep among religious fundamentalists, the sectarian wrath of pro choice lobbyists, even the mounting appeal of such radical politicians as David Duke, all speak in favor of one thing: substituting the voice of spiritual guide, or God, as it were, for that of law.

A couple cannot claim their sex based Church of the Most High Goddess is a religion protected by constitutional freedoms and thus immune from attempts to enforce vice laws, a federal judge ruled Thursday. Wilbur Tracy, 51, and his wife, Mary Ellen, 47, argued that the church, which promises salvation through sex in exchange for monetary sacrifices, should be protected by the U.S. Constitution. The couple testified the church was based on an ancient Eqyptian religion in which intercourse with Mrs. Tracy, alias priestess Sabrina Aset, cleansed the soul as a purification rite.
