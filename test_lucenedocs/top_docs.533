ELEVEN weeks ago I sat in the press box at Twickenham filled with apprehension as England faced Australia in the final of the World Cup. England had played heroically to defeat France and Scotland in eight days away from home, at that but now, surely, their number was up against the most gifted all round team in the event. So Australia's victory was not unexpected (they had beaten England 40 15 only a few months earlier).

Ominously for British fans, the strengthening process is likely to accelerate in the next couple of years, when the competition will be expanded to include Auckland in New Zealand, adding all the emotions of international football to the weekly league programme. Like their British counterparts, Australian coaches put a lot of emphasis on commitment, physical fitness and tough tackling.

But the dry sun baked grounds also encourage speed and ball handling skills which are harder to develop in the freezing dampness of English winters. The Australians have benefitted over the last few years from the inspirational captaincy of two outstanding players who epitomise all these qualities: 'King' Wally Lewis from 1984 to 1990, and latterly Meninga, Australia's most capped player and record scorer with 250 points.

Two weeks ago, I took one of the Sydney's new double decker trains to North Sydney to watch the rugby union semi final between Warringah and Gordon. The ground has a Field of Dreams quality to it; it is a quaint and mellow oval which could easily double as a home for a Palm Court orchestra and it is owned not by Warringah or Gordon or by the Sydney or New South Wales RFUs but by the local council. As such it plays home at weekends to the North Sydney professional rugby league team and a host of rugby union sides, something we, in England, find unacceptable, although why we do, is hard to fathom.

Something is going right with English sport. First, Terry Venables' appointment is applauded, second, Ray Illingworth comes in from the cold to take the reins of the England cricket team and, late yesterday, the Rugby Football Union continued this uncanny run of common sense by appointing Jack Rowell, the Bath coach, to be the new guru for the national side. The announcement was expected on Monday but its timing gives him the chance of being fully involved with this afternoon's game.

The announcement was expected on Monday but its timing gives him the chance of being fully involved with this afternoon's game. Rowell's appointment will be widely welcomed, except perhaps by a few die hards within the RFU executive committee. Rowell's precise role will need to be carefully defined over the coming months.
FT941-2570
Rowell's appointment will be widely welcomed, except perhaps by a few die hards within the RFU executive committee. Rowell's precise role will need to be carefully defined over the coming months. He may want to merge the role of manager and coach.
FT941-2570
Rowell's precise role will need to be carefully defined over the coming months. He may want to merge the role of manager and coach. Dick Best is the present England coach, but the jury is out on his contribution to the England set up over the past three years.
FT941-2570
He may want to merge the role of manager and coach. Dick Best is the present England coach, but the jury is out on his contribution to the England set up over the past three years. He is an enlightened coach but his work for England has gone largely unnoticed.

He is an enlightened coach but his work for England has gone largely unnoticed. Geoff Cooke has retained all the power in selection. In particular, Best lost the case for Stuart Barnes, the Bath captain, as the pivot on which to base his England team.

Geoff Cooke has retained all the power in selection. In particular, Best lost the case for Stuart Barnes, the Bath captain, as the pivot on which to base his England team. Without Barnes, a running outside half, Best lost the architect of his tactics.

In particular, Best lost the case for Stuart Barnes, the Bath captain, as the pivot on which to base his England team. Without Barnes, a running outside half, Best lost the architect of his tactics. Instead, we have had a diet of unrelieved boredom from the England camp, the win against the All Blacks notwithstanding.

Without Barnes, a running outside half, Best lost the architect of his tactics. Instead, we have had a diet of unrelieved boredom from the England camp, the win against the All Blacks notwithstanding. The England team, instead of building another dimension to their game, as the Australians did between their Grand Slam in 1984 and their winning of the World Cup in 1991, has gone from rags to riches to rags in an identical period of time.

And, in between, France and now Wales have made great strides to catch up. Cooke's control of the England team was suffocating the side.

Rowell's appointment may lead to a shake up in the England team. He will probably replace Andrew with Barnes and ask Will Carling to stand down as captain.

We might just have reached the same conclusion over gifted Welsh centre Scott Gibbs who has also been absent for the tournament.

And the Welsh coaches, criticized after poor performances by Wales against lowly Canada and Tonga at the World Cup, were not about to restrain their players in a mismatch against the upstart Yanks. To cut a long and sad American story short, the final score was 46 0. It was the Eagles' worst defeat since their 1982 52 0 trouncing by England, and a huge setback for the team, described after recent encouraging performances as international rugby's sleeping giant.

Since rugby is supposed to be a handling game, I do not understand why it is an offence to handle in the rucks, provided the player is not preventing the ball being played. The laws governing penalties are a muddle. The 'double' penalty that allows sides to kick to touch and still gain the throw in has made line outs even more important.

THERE IS much more at stake at Twickenham this afternoon than whether Scotland can beat England in the 100th Calcutta Cup match between them and win the Triple Crown of the Five Nations championship. The sub text is this: which of the two captains, Gavin Hastings of Scotland and Will Carling of England, has the better game? The one who comes out on top is likely to be named captain of the British Lions when the party to tour New Zealand is announced later this month.

The Five Nations Championship opens this afternoon with France (the champions) playing rejuvenated Ireland, and Wales (the holders of the wooden spoon) entertaining Scotland in Cardiff.

War broke out on the four home unions television sub committee when the RFU suggested that the traditional equal split of everything needed reassessing.

Rugby's television contract from September 1, 1994 is for sale and as rugby is a sport of political intrigue, the debate about who will win has caused much commotion and emotion off the field.

The problem is that the French Federation de Rugby already has its own deal for the Five Nations and for years has received more money than any of the four home unions.

Such is their transformation that if they win today it will be the third year in a row that they have collected both of League's top prizes the Challenge Cup and the Stones Bitter Championship: indeed, it will be their fifth successive Challenge Cup.

RUGBY UNION: England v Romania, November 12, Twickenham There have been two talking points in rugby union over the last week.

The second was the oh so sharp pen of former England stand off Stuart Barnes.

Rugby is growing in popularity, for players and spectators, in a way it has not done since, nearly 30 years ago, kicking to touch was banned from outside your own 22. Yet, on the evidence of this season in Europe, the turnover law has done the opposite of what was intended.

Teams get into their opponents' territory and kick the ball high in the air as an attacking ploy, rather than run at them and risk conceding the put in at a scrum.

Teams get into their opponents' territory and kick the ball high in the air as an attacking ploy, rather than run at them and risk conceding the put in at a scrum. Furthermore, it encourages the defending side's back row to stand off at rucks so they are ready to move around the field and end attacks.

One of the sights of the recent All Blacks' tour of Britain was the mighty winger, Vai'aiga Tuigamala, a terrifying man, who felicitously combines the destructive potential of a medieval battering ram with intelligence and finesse of the highest order.
