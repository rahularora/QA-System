After a quarter century on the job, the ZIP code like most of us has gained a little weight. But it still helps smooth the flow of nearly half the world's mail. Friday marked the 25th anniversary of that string of numbers bringing up the rear of every U.S. address, a system ordered into use by by then Postmaster General J. Edward Day, who says he simply got tired of waiting for bureaucrats to finish studying the idea.

More people are finding a credit card bill in their mailbox before they find the credit card. Each year, millions of new credit cards are delivered through the mail, often in envelopes hailing the plastic card inside. That makes the postal system one of the weakest links in the cards' chain of custody, giving mail sorters and letter carriers easy and constant access to a rich vein of plastic gold.

The Postal Service will seek rate increases that would average 16% for all classes of mail and boost the cost of postage for a first class letter to 25 cents for the first ounce, officials said. If approved, the increase would take effect in about a year, and postal officials hope to maintain the new rates for about three years. The chairman of the Postal Service Board of Governors, John Griesemer, said the rising cost of postal operations, labor and retirement benefits will require higher rates by mid 1988.

Frederick Stow Jr. Houston Your editorial discussion of the Postal Service's monopoly and its inability to correct an increasingly poor delivery system struck a responsive memory chord. Many years ago in Washington, Sen. Dewey Bartlett, who served on the postal affairs subcommittee, told several of us the cure was beyond any horizon. In commenting on a then 3 cent postage increase, he noted his wife suspected it was for storage, but he added a tongue in cheek solution to uncertain delivery; he suggested that all postal employees' salaries be paid by check in unmarked envelopes.

The independent Postal Rate Commission recommended a sweeping series of increases in U.S. postage rates Friday, including boosting the cost of first class letters to 25 cents. But the agency also put forth a proposal to charge consumers less than a quarter for paying bills and recommended that advertising mail rates increase by even larger percentages than other groups. The complex series of rate proposals now goes to the board of governors of the Postal Service, which requested rate hikes 10 months ago.

GTE's labs in Waltham, Mass., recently developed a low cost method for extending fiber optic lines from neighborhood telephone feeder boxes to homes. GTE scientists etched a tiny chip of silicon with grooves that allow lasers the size of a pinhead and hair thin fibers to be mounted automatically. GTE estimates that a 16 laser package is one twentieth the size of today's individually packed lasers and requires 1% of the time to assemble.

GTE scientists etched a tiny chip of silicon with grooves that allow lasers the size of a pinhead and hair thin fibers to be mounted automatically. GTE estimates that a 16 laser package is one twentieth the size of today's individually packed lasers and requires 1% of the time to assemble. That's significant because we have to bring the cost down to parity with a copper wire system, says Craig Armiento, research supervisor.

That's significant because we have to bring the cost down to parity with a copper wire system, says Craig Armiento, research supervisor. He's not sure when that will happen, though. GTE's advance comes about a year after the phone industry set a strict standard requiring all new fiber optic equipment to be built to the Synchronous Optical Network specifications.

GTE's advance comes about a year after the phone industry set a strict standard requiring all new fiber optic equipment to be built to the Synchronous Optical Network specifications. This should widen the field of suppliers and spur construction of broadband networks pumping voice, data and TV to homes.

About a dozen big postal centers around the country are installing voice recognition systems that help sort and batch letters, even into the mail carrier's bag, says Wayne Nelson, manager of the engineering technical unit at the Oklahoma City Post Office.

Responding to spoken commands, a computer at the Oklahoma City center sorts mail sacks according to ZIP code. The new system uses one operator who looks at the sack, notes its ZIP code and speaks the number into a headset microphone using a normal conversational speech, says Mr. Nelson.

The new system uses one operator who looks at the sack, notes its ZIP code and speaks the number into a headset microphone using a normal conversational speech, says Mr. Nelson. That's quicker than the old system in which one operator handled the sacks and called out the number while another worker punched the ZIP code into a keypad.

This summer, New York magazine decided to test the U.S. Postal Service's claim that it delivers 90% of the mail on time in Manhattan. It arranged for 144 letters to be mailed from all over the country to Manhattan zip codes that postal officials claimed were generally free of delivery trouble.

Postal Service's claim that it delivers 90% of the mail on time in Manhattan. It arranged for 144 letters to be mailed from all over the country to Manhattan zip codes that postal officials claimed were generally free of delivery trouble. The results show that the Postal Service's claims belong in the dead letter office, and may also explain why it has been so much on the defensive of late.

The results show that the Postal Service's claims belong in the dead letter office, and may also explain why it has been so much on the defensive of late. Only 50% of the letters mailed from within New York City or from Los Angeles arrived on time, and just 33% of letters from the Washington, D.C., area arrived within two days.

More and more Americans are frustrated by a Postal Service that according to Federal Trade Commission Chairman Dan Oliver is a classic monopoly dinosaur. The nature of a monopoly is to charge higher prices while restricting consumer choices, he wrote in a May letter to Postmaster General Preston Tisch. Mr. Oliver called for repeal of the 1872 Private Express Statutes, which forbid first class delivery service from competing with the Postal Service.

In a hand delivered reply the postmaster general strongly disagreed and wrote that the public was receiving better mail service across the board than ever before, a contention belied by the growing number of businesses and individuals who now send even routine documents via private overnight delivery services.

If mail service fails to improve significantly, some experts estimate that 60% of business mail will be delivered electronically by the year 2000. That would remove most of the Postal Service's most lucrative business, and force either price hikes or huge taxpayer subsidies.

Hiring permanent part time workers and contracting out some services may have to be considered as ways to save money in postal operations, Postmaster General Anthony Frank told a Senate subcommittee Friday. Rising health care costs and other expenses are eating up savings realized through automation, and the massive postal agency needs to look throughout its operations to find ways to cut costs, Frank told the subcommittee on federal services, post office and civil service. So far this year, while we still anticipate that revenues will exceed expenses by a small margin, we have not done as well as we had planned, Frank reported.

The Postal Service had planned for a surplus this year based on the 25 cent postage rate that took effect just a year ago. Frank has said previously that he expected the agency to drop into the red in 1990 and face another rate increase in 1991, maintaining the recent cycle of increasing postage costs every three years. When postal managers applied for the current rates they were overly optimistic in their projections in an effort to achieve the round figure of a quarter, Frank told the subcommittee.
