The first state to ban indoor smoking except for designated areas is now taking the lead nationally in trying to snuff out cigarette machines or at least keep them out of youngsters' reach. Since the St. Paul suburb of White Bear Lake passed the state's first ban on cigarette vending machines in October, at least 20 other Minnesota cities have prohibited or restricted the machines. The restrictions are part of a grass roots movement for a smoke free society, said Jean Forster, assistant professor in the University of Minnesota's School of Public Health.

Major universities are warning the Pentagon that a military policy barring homosexuals from service is generating pressure to oust ROTC from campuses.

Deutch, provost of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said in a letter to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Many universities will withdraw from the ROTC program, Deutch wrote.

We want to get rid of the disease, and it seems now it might be easier than we thought. Lyme disease, which is spread by ticks found on deer, mice and other mammals, usually begins with a characteristic bull's eye rash, a red ring around a clear center. It causes arthritis like inflammation of the joints and can cause damage to the nervous system.

But Sullivan said that was a trade issue and best addressed by trade officials. He said one of his top priorities remains to eliminate the use of the only legal substance that when used as intended causes death. Cigarettes, health officials say, cause about 390,000 premature deaths annually from lung cancer, heart disease and other cardiovascular disorders.

An unusually arid spring has kicked up what meteorologists are calling the worst blowing dust in at least a decade, damaging crops and creating hazardous driving conditions in Minnesota, South and North Dakota. Light rain that fell in parts of northern Minnesota and North Dakota today will help somewhat, said Sam Standfield of the National Weather Service in Minneapolis. It will help at least keep the dust down for a while, but we're going to need more rain than this to end the drought problem, Standfield said.

The Minnesota Supercomputer Center said Tuesday it will install International Business Machine Corp.'s most powerful computer as part of a $55 million partnership expected to influence design of the next generation of IBM supercomputers. Using an IBM 3090 supercomputer with 12 interconnected processing units and with a memory capacity of more than five billion characters of information, the supercomputer center will explore new ways to connect even more advanced supercomputers, the center and IBM said in a joint statement. IBM is funding about half the cost of the project, according to the statement.

The Minneapolis area will soon be at the center of an attempt to use one of the world's fastest supercomputers to dramatically reduce guesswork in economic forecasting. If successful, the three year project using a Cray Research Inc. supercomputer could make businesses, consumers and workers less vulnerable to blunders caused by faulty assumptions about the nation's economy. In recent years, supercomputers have produced revolutionary solutions to complex problems in engineering, chemistry, physics, biology, meteorology and other disciplines.

Scientists have known for many years that specific parts of the human brain are used for performing different types of thinking, but pin pointing and mapping these areas has proved difficult. Now a team of researchers from AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories and the University of Minnesota Medical School has developed a new non invasive technique which enables them to safely and accurately 'see' the human brain working in a normal conscious person. The scanning technique, called Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (Bold) imaging, detects increases in oxygenated blood flow to active areas of the brain.

Unlike the standard images of different types of brain tissue produced by conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, the new method provides colour images showing the precise locations of increased neuron activity.

A heart lung transplant surgeon at the University of Minnesota filed a defamation lawsuit against a newspaper's unidentified sources who said he ordered an operation on a patient already considered dead. The suit, filed Tuesday in Hennepin County District Court, centers on a story that appeared in the Star Tribune Aug. 2. The story said the university was investigating an allegation that Dr. Stuart Jamieson ordered an associate to perform a bypass operation on a patient who was considered dead before the surgery began.

Gorbachev's six hour stop in Minneapolis on Sunday to meet with captains of industry and agriculture promises to bear little resemblance to Nikita Khrushchev's 1959 visit to an Iowa farm. If you want to go to a place in the Midwest that is different than New York, and you want to go to a place that is not a Rust Belt center but a place on the cutting edge, it could be that Minnesota is the place, said Thomas Noonan, a Russian studies professor at the University of Minnesota.

A world renowned heart and lung transplant surgeon has been ousted from his position as head of the division of cardiovascular surgery at the University of Minnesota Hospital. Dr. Stuart Jamieson was relieved temporarily in early August during an investigation into assorted allegations, among them a never proven claim that he or one of his assistants left a forceps inside a patient's chest and then did not inform the patient of the fact. In a brief news release offering no explanations, the hospital said Friday that after considerable thought and external consultation, a decision has now been made not to reinstate Dr. Jamieson to his leadership post.

The test might say you're a raving lunatic and then we'd interview you to see if it's true, says Mr. Arnold. Legal challenges from hapless job seekers who find discrimination and privacy invasion in the test haven't succeeded in court either, according to James Butcher, a professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota and one of the psychologists who oversaw the recent sprucing up of MMPI. Firefighters in Jersey City, N.J., lost a suit opposing MMPI because, the judge said, a municipality should be able to use whatever means it has at its disposal to ensure the mental stability of workers in high stress jobs.

An educator withdrew his name from consideration for president of North Dakota State University on Friday night after admitting he lifted part of a presentation for the job from a magazine article. Richard Sauer, acting president of the University of Minnesota, conceded he failed to credit the article in the speech given at NDSU in Fargo, N.D., on Monday but said he had not been trying to claim authorship. He called William C. Nelson, chairman of the NDSU presidential search committee, to say he was withdrawing from consideration, Nelson said.

The uneducated and poor still face the greatest threat from heart disease, although people of all social classes have reduced their risk equally in recent years, a study suggests. University of Minnesota epidemiologist Wayne Rosamond, who co authored the study, presented the findings Thursday during the American Heart Association's annual conference on heart disease epidemiology, the study of disease among population groups. The results indicate lower socioeconomic classes obviously have not caught up with the relative advantages of being more educated and more affluent, said Dr. Elizabeth Barrett Connor, a University of California, San Diego, researcher and chairwoman of the association's epidemiology council.

But for a heavy smoker that risk rises to 5% by age 50, to 16% by age 60, and to 25% by age 70. By age 60 a heavy smoker with one copy of the gene is 6.5 times more likely to get lung cancer than a heavy smoker without the gene. George E. Bonney, a geneticist at Howard University in Washington and an expert in analyzing gene patterns in families, writes in an accompanying article in the NCI journal that the sample size of the study is so large that findings are unlikely to be false.

Businesses looking to expand in congested cities like New York, Chicago and San Francisco usually turn to skyscrapers or the suburbs, but a group of engineers and architects says a better solution lies just below the surface. Building underground has the potential to provide millions of square feet of clean, energy efficient space in the nation's major cities, according to the American Underground Space Association. Underground has the benefit of allowing greater density in urban areas and mitigating the need for sprawl, Susan Nelson, the group's executive director, said in a recent interview.
