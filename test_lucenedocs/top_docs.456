Federal Aviation Administrator Donald Engen pledged to reduce airline flights if necessary to ensure safety this summer, but National Transportation Safety Board Chairman James Burnett said the situation already is critical in some areas because of overcrowding. Their comments came at a Senate Aviation subcommittee hearing, during which three senators warned that Congress might impose flight reductions during the busy summer travel season, which begins Monday, if the FAA fails to take appropriate steps to protect air travelers. The air traffic control system in our busiest corridors cannot handle more traffic, asserted Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.), chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee.

A code shows how often a flight has been on time in the previous month, although a customer normally must ask for the information. But travelers so far have not availed themselves to such information on a wide scale basis, according to travel agents.

But travelers so far have not availed themselves to such information on a wide scale basis, according to travel agents. Furthermore, some critics have argued that the information is of minimal value because often a traveler has little choice as to which flight to take to a particular city.

Many members of Congress want more detailed consumer reporting by the airlines, but consumer legislation aimed at the airlines has been bogged down in a dispute over testing airline employes for drugs. Airline opposition is strongest to provisions in pending legislation that would require the Transportation Department as well as airlines to provide toll free telephone lines for consumer complaints; provide free tickets for lost baggage; require that tickets be refundable; and require airlines to establish a minimum time for flights.

Commercial airliners are filling the skies in ever increasing numbers, causing backups and delays that worry industry officials and leave passengers grumbling in airport waiting lounges. Industry officials in Europe predict one of the gloomiest summers ever for flight delays as air traffic controllers struggle to allocate slots to a record number of flights in already crowded skies. One of the reasons is the makeup of Europe itself.

The number of flights delayed 15 minutes or more past their scheduled arrival times totaled 27,298 in August, down 32% from July's 39,975 delays and well below the 35,673 flight delays in August of last year, according to figures compiled by the Federal Aviation Administration, a department unit. The decline, the biggest monthly drop since January, helped reduce the number of delays during the busy May August air travel season to 143,514, or 11% below the same four months of last year, the department said.

In its initial rejection, the Transportation Department had said it would accept British Airways reduced fares for travel starting by April 30, before the peak summer travel season. Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner had blocked British Airways one third sale for the first time last Tuesday, citing the disappointing pace of U.S. U.K. talks over the proposed sales of London operations by Pan Am and Trans World Airlines Inc. Pan Am has agreed to sell its route authorities at London's Heathrow Airport to UAL Corp.'s United Airlines for $290 million. TWA is set to sell its London operations to AMR Corp.'s American Airlines for $445 million.

The Justice Department sharply criticized the Transportation Department's plan to grant airlines antitrust immunity so they can meet each other and revise their schedules, saying the action could raise ticket prices and reduce service. The Transportation Department last month offered airlines operating at 13 busy airports antitrust immunity in an effort to encourage them to debunch their schedules at peak hours and reduce delays. The offer required that any airline request the immunity, which Dallas based AMR Corp.'s American Airlines subsequently did.

Airline flight delays at the nation's 22 busiest airports rose 8.7% in the first four months of this year, partly reflecting a surge in delays at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport. Statistics released by the Federal Aviation Administration show that delays at Hartsfield, which during the period surpassed Chicago's O'Hare as the nation's busiest airport, rose to 74 per 1,000 flights from 18 per 1,000 the same time last year. The number of flights at Atlanta rose to 264,647, compared with 263,978 at Chicago.

Already, the industry estimates air traffic control delays cost it $2 billion a year and tie up the equivalent of 235 airplanes. But the biggest hindrance to improvement is simply that more people will be flying, and that growth should easily outstrip efforts to boost airport and air traffic capacity.

The department said that talks weren't needed now, but that it would reconsider its decision if delays worsened. For years, the New York area airports have led the nation in delays. But in recent weeks, delays have declined, partly because of the FAA's new East Coast plan, which streamlined air traffic control procedures.

If accidents are the barometer, there is no doubt that air travel is safer today than a decade ago when Congress deregulated the industry. But aviation safety experts say those statistics don't tell the whole story. Concerns persist about the government's ability to keep airlines honest when industry executives in a fiercely competitive environment must face the twin challenges of safety and the bottom line.

A recent Federal Aviation Administration survey of the nation's 23 busiest airports found that, over six hours, private aircraft made 175 intrusions into restricted airspace. This disclosure followed last summer's collision in Los Angeles between an Aeromexico jetliner and a private plane that strayed into restricted airspace, and may help lead to a proper response to the risk of midair collisions. Despite the Aeromexico disaster, scheduled commercial carriers in the U.S. are much safer today than before airline deregulation.

The premiums also could be experience rated, assuming that the FAA were to disclose to insurance companies information regarding individual TCA violators. Fliers who violated TCA airspace would pay higher insurance premiums, just as do motorists with too many moving violations.

Demand side strategies for air traffic safety may irritate the general aviation lobby, but that interest group would be hard pressed to explain why pilots shouldn't accept responsibility for the harm their actions may impose on others.

Currently, only half its controllers are fully qualified, despite the facility manager's effort to increase that to three quarters. Norbert Owens, deputy associate administrator for air traffic at FAA headquarters, says the agency would like to offer extra pay to controllers willing to move to Chicago.

Norbert Owens, deputy associate administrator for air traffic at FAA headquarters, says the agency would like to offer extra pay to controllers willing to move to Chicago. But other FAA officials are doubtful that such a move would be approved because other federal agencies would want similar benefits for their employees in high cost areas.

Airline and airport officials point the finger at the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which they say uses time consuming processing methods and has been slow in hiring needed inspectors. INS officials say that they are moving to increase hiring and improve processing but that meantime the service's duty is to check all incoming international air travelers. Currently, immigration delays in San Francisco and at New York's Kennedy Airport sometimes total two hours.

But a $15 million grass roots campaign to persuade business and political leaders to push for new airport capacity has so far produced little. I don't see a hell of a lot of difference between our aviation problems a year ago and our aviation problems today except today they are worse, Crandall said at a recent industry conference.

{First in a Series} In the annals of air travel, 1987 may go down as the year of the frequently furious flier. Complaints about service are at an all time high, with flight delays and cancellations provoking protest chants and even violence among angry passengers.

On one Saturday this month, the Civil Aviation Authority in Britain suspended flights between the new London City Airport and Paris because of fears of midair collisions. Pilots for Brymon Airways, a commuter airline that flew to Paris six times a day from the central London airport, have complained in recent weeks about near collisions in London's crowded airspace.

Some aviation safety experts and the airlines say a new requirement aimed at easing the threat of collisions near airports still leaves commercial jets exposed to danger from small planes. The Federal Aviation Administration rule announced last week calls for sharply expanding the airspace in which small, private planes must have equipment that tells controllers their altitude. FAA officials predict it will result in a significant increase in air safety.

The system is now being tested on a Piedmont airliner.

Thousands of tourists began their summer holidays by camping at British airports as the aftereffects of a Greek air traffic controllers' strike wreaked havoc on already busy summer flight schedules. On Friday, the average delay in flights from Britain to the Mediterranean was six hours, with some flights delayed up to 48 hours at Manchester's airport in north England and up to 24 hours at London's Gatwick Airport. Director Keith Mack of the Civil Aviation Authority said he expected the congestion at British airports to worsen this summer with possible further job action by air traffic controllers in Spain and France.

From labor travails to terrorist threats to rising fuel prices to aging planes, the nation's airlines face daunting challenges as their busiest season of the year begins this Memorial Day weekend.

The liberalisation of the European air transport market, coupled with the continuing impact of the general economic slowdown, has had significant repercussions on Europe's airline industry this year. The deregulation of air fares on January 1 has already sparked a price war in Europe. Lufthansa of Germany was the first to take advantage of the new liberal regime in Europe, cutting fares from Germany and the UK.

To give some example, in October of 1987 at O'Hare we were above 95 percent in our arrivals within 15 minutes. That dropped to about 75 percent in October of this year.

The controllers handling aircraft in the Chicago area had committed an unusually high number of errors this year.

An electrical fire broke out in the control tower at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport today, temporarily suspending operations and diverting flights to other airports for about an hour. The fire, which broke out during the noontime rush, one of the busiest times of day for air travel, forced evacuation of the tower at the world's fourth busiest airport. The fire at the base of the Federal Aviation Administration tower was extinguished within minutes, said Angel Biasatti, a public information officer at the airport.

Since the nation's airline industry was deregulated in October 1978, a debate has raged on the benefits and problems created by the move. Among the main benefits, according to supporters and industry experts: A democratization of air travel, formerly the domain of relatively few Americans. The number of passengers on U.S. airlines jumped to around 455 million last year from 275 million in 1978.

A presidential commission concluded Monday that the U.S. air transport system is safe for the time being, but urged appointment of a safety czar in a newly independent Federal Aviation Administration whose officials would be insulated from political pressures. The nation's air transportation system is safe, for now, said John M. Albertine, chairman of the Aviation Safety Commission whose final report was issued after a nine month study of the rapidly growing airline industry. However, that safety is being maintained to an increasing extent through delays and through what I can only characterize as heroic efforts of air traffic controllers, airways facilities technicians, safety inspectors and others, Albertine said.

Tightening controls over small airplanes, the Transportation Department accelerated by more than four years a requirement that all planes operating at 14 major U.S. airports be equipped with altitude reporting devices. The new deadline is Dec. 1, 1987, rather than Jan. 1, 1992, and will affect an estimated 2,400 small aircraft. Already, all aircraft operating at the nation's nine busiest airports and all commercial airliners must be equipped with the devices, known as Mode C transponders.

Under the plan, which was announced Wednesday but had taken effect earlier this week, flights to Chicago will be delayed on the ground in their cities of origin rather than in the air over O'Hare and the smaller Midway Airport here when there is too much traffic, said FAA spokeswoman Barbara Dettmer.

In comparison, Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport the nation's second busiest has had six errors this year, and Washington's National Airport just two, officials said. The latest incidents here came just two months after the National Transportation Safety Board issued a report saying that chronic understaffing of controllers, mandatory overtime, outdated equipment and inadequate training contributed to mistakes at O'Hare.

On Sunday, two United jets came within 500 feet of each other after the pilot of one plane apparently followed an order intended for the other. On Friday, two Air Wisconsin jets came near each other when a controller apparently mistakenly gave one of them an order to descend from 14,000 feet to 11,000, the FAA said.
