A businessman was named a special Sioux chief Saturday and pledged to unite Indians to regain land they lost after gold was discovered, although some Sioux believe he is impersonating an Indian. I promise you I will carry the battle lance of our people ... until the Black Hills are once again ours forever more, Phillip J. Stevens, of Irvine, Calif., told a crowd of more than 600 people who attended a ceremony at the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation. Stevens, who wore fringed buckskins decorated with Indian beadwork, was given a shield and headdress made of imitation eagle feathers and the name Man Who Walks With The Shield.

Gamblers drawn by $1 million jackpots and pickup trucks as prizes are trying their luck at South Dakota's first Indian casino, the newest hope of prosperity for the hard pressed Santee Sioux tribe. The casino, in the style of Las Vegas and Atlantic City, N.J., opened Tuesday with slot machines, card games and bingo on a dusty plot of reservation land surrounded by cornfields outside Flandreau, population 2,200. The town is small but the stakes are high for gamblers as well as the Sioux, who stand to earn $750,000 to $1 million in the casino's first year.

Earlier, Dennis Neill of the U.S. Forest Service said the showers helped lower the temperature and raise the humidity, but also could bring stronger winds and the possibility of lightning. Lightning is believed to have started the fire Monday night in Custer State Park. It spread Wednesday into the Black Hills National Forest, site of the memorial to four presidents.

George Mickelson was 7 when he watched his father, the governor, help sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski dynamite the first rock from a rugged Black Hills mountain that the artist wanted to shape into a likeness of Sioux Indian leader Crazy Horse. Mickelson, now governor himself, planned to help Ziolkowski's widow set off another explosion today to mark the 40th anniversary of the start of that project, which is still under way in western South Dakota. Mickelson said his return to Crazy Horse Memorial, about 10 miles west of Mount Rushmore National Memorial, would follow the Indian theme that life moves in circles.

Firefighters beat back a forest fire that prompted the evacuation of more than 1,000 people near Mount Rushmore National Memorial, allowing it to be reopened, while a second blaze nearly brushed the Alaska Pipeline. In South Carolina, a 1,000 acre blaze jumped plowed fire lines in four locations Thursday and ate up another 150 acres of timber and brush dried by heat and drought, while land managers in Alaska took a new tack in their battle against four fires raging over 270,000 acres. Fifty percent of South Dakota's Custer State Park fire, which has burned 16,000 acres, was contained by Thursday night, said fire information officer Jerry Hagen.

The blaze has scorched 109,000 of the park's 2.2 million acres. Firefighters with flame throwers and some in helicopters lit backfires in about 1,000 acres of meadow to burn fuel ahead of the fire and direct it away from Old Faithful, the park's most famous attraction, and nearby structures.

Bitter debates on a proposed tax limit and two measures aimed at protecting the Black Hills from surface mining dominated the campaign in South Dakota, where the presidential race appeared very close heading into Tuesday's election. State party officials described the battle between George Bush and Michael Dukakis as a tossup, and the two candidates made late campaign appearances to bid for the farm vote that could decide who takes South Dakota's three electoral votes. The harshest words of the campaign were exchanged by supporters and opponents of a proposed constitutional amendment to limit property taxes and two measures calling for stricter reclamation standards and higher taxes on surface mines.

IN THE SPIRIT OF CRAZY HORSE by Peter Mathiessen Harvill Pounds 9.99, 646 pages IF YOU think Rodney King got a bum deal, spare a thought for Leonard Peltier. Since 1977, the American Indian activist has been serving a double life sentence for the murder of two FBI agents after having been convicted on the flimsiest of evidence. Unfortunately for Peltier, there was nobody with a camcorder on the scene to show what really happened.

Activists Abbie Hoffman and Dennis Banks, who've run afoul of the law in bucking the system, say they've also learned how to make a buck during their years as political gadflies. Hoffman, the antic activist who once offered a pig as a presidential candidate, says he's been cutting it up long enough to know how to work an audience as a comedian, rather than just as an advocate who uses humor. Banks, the former Indian activist, noted that something good has come of all his economic development work in South Dakota.

Wild Bill Hickok was shot in the head during a poker game in Deadwood more than a century ago, but the city's voters have bet that restoring gambling will give a shot in the arm to the gold rush town's economy. Residents voted 690 230 Tuesday to allow poker, blackjack and slot machines, with the city's cut of the proceeds to be used to restore and preserve buildings in the historic Black Hills community of 2,000. An amendment to the South Dakota Constitution last year provided that gambling limited to $5 bets would be permitted in Deadwood if 60 percent of the city's voters approved it.

In Wyoming, gusting winds that spread the fire in the Bridger Teton forest Tuesday built again Wednesday afternoon, threatening crews' hopes of containing the blaze by evening, said forest spokesman Fred Kingwill. A volunteer firefighter was taken to the Salt Lake City Burn Center with serious burns on his hands, arms and chest, Kingwill said. The fire, burning in sagebrush, juniper and aspen groves near the southern end of Fremont Lake, was sparked by Fourth of July revelers, the Forest Service said.

Hundreds of thousands of Americans seeking a profound religious experience will flock this year to elaborately mounted passion plays, an art form that has been a source of centuries of suffering for Jews. The plays in places such as Eureka Springs, Ark., and Spearfish, S.D., evoke controversy among Christians and Jews about whether they promote one of history's cruelest anti Semitic stereotypes: that Jews bear a collective guilt for all time for Jesus' death. The passion play, portraying Christ's death and resurrection, dates to the 13th century.

A wintry storm marching across the continent hit the northern Plains with up to 18 inches of snow Monday, and high wind, poor visibility and icy roads combined to close schools. By afternoon, snow fell over much of the northern Plains region and the upper Mississippi Valley, while rain extended from eastern Nebraska into the upper Great Lakes region and northern sections of the lower Ohio Valley. The storm had produced more than 3 feet of snow in California's Sierra Nevada range on Saturday, and on Sunday dumped 10 to 20 inches of snow at many ski resorts in Colorado.
