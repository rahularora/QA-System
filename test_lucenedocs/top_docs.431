Nursing home residents whose hearts have stopped are so rarely helped by cardiopulmonary resuscitation that perhaps homes should not even offer to try it, researchers suggest. Failing that policy change, residents who want to avoid resuscitation should get their doctors to record that wish in their medical records and should legally appoint somebody to speak for them, said researcher Dr. Thomas Finucane. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, called CPR, involves forceful thrusts to the chest and blowing air into the mouth.

Pet shop owner Patricia Lopes says she doesn't mind kissing dogs, but she'd rather not perform mouth to mouth resuscitation again. All I thought about was what do I do with the tongue, Lopes said Tuesday after reviving a greyhound with cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Lopes, who runs a pet grooming store, said she had just finished bathing and clipping the toenails of Escape, a 13 year old retired racer, when the dog collapsed Saturday.

Doctors should explain to the elderly and to gravely ill patients in the hospital that if their hearts stop, reviving them with CPR will probably buy them little time and may be traumatic, researchers say. One third of Americans who die in hospitals undergo cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, at some time. The procedure is futile for some patients and should be eliminated for them, research suggests.

A 74 year old man suffered a heart attack while practicing life saving techniques in a cardiopulmonary resuscitation course, but was revived by his instructors. Melvin Bishop' eyes rolled up and he fell over while compressing the chest of a practice dummy during the CPR class Saturday at the Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. building, instructor Len Heroux said. Finding no pulse, Heroux began performing the same compression technique Bishop had been practicing.

CPR by paramedics saves almost as many elderly heart attack victims as it does younger ones, and should not be abandoned for older people in an effort to eliminate useless procedures, a study concludes. Some previous research of cardiopulmonary resuscitation has suggested the elderly may derive negligible benefit from attempts to revive them after out of hospital cardiac arrests. Survival rates in those studies were as low as 1 percent.

A device that takes over the function of the heart pumping oxygenated blood throughout the body could more than double the number of people who survive sudden cardiac arrest, researchers say. In its first human test, the pump kept blood flowing through one woman for 15 hours until doctors got her heart working properly again. Had they not gotten approval ... to use this machine, I can question whether I'd be alive, said Sharon Wilczynski, 29, who survived her heart attack although she was clinically dead several times during the ordeal.

Lurie said the plunging also may have helped draw air into the patient's lungs. He said the son suggested that toilet plungers be placed next to all beds in the hospital's coronary care unit. We recommended that he take a basic CPR course but had to admit it's hard to argue with success, Lurie wrote.

Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN <F P=106> [Article by Alberto Ramirez Espada] </F> [Text] The OAS International Human Rights Commission described to President Ramiro de Leon Carpio during a meeting held last night at the presidential palace the need for the withdrawal of all military detachments located in areas where the Communities of Resistant People (CPR) have settled. The meeting was held following the conclusion of an OAS visit that lasted several days to the areas in conflict. Leo Valle Lanza, president of the international commission, indicated they had received reports from the CPR settlers on harassment by Army soldiers, mined camps, and restrictions placed on their movements.

The meeting was held following the conclusion of an OAS visit that lasted several days to the areas in conflict. Leo Valle Lanza, president of the international commission, indicated they had received reports from the CPR settlers on harassment by Army soldiers, mined camps, and restrictions placed on their movements. It is obvious that as a result of the proximity of the combat areas, there could be guerrilla movements, but this does not necessarily imply the CPR are cooperating with the subversives, Valle Lanza added.

It is obvious that as a result of the proximity of the combat areas, there could be guerrilla movements, but this does not necessarily imply the CPR are cooperating with the subversives, Valle Lanza added. The only thing they want is to be recognized as a civilian population and for their most basic rights to be respected, noted the international official who also indicated President de Leon Carpio had confirmed his intentions to respect those rights.

New, easy to use heart shock machines are a very, very important advance that improve the odds of saving many of the 400,000 Americans who die each year of cardiac arrest, researchers reported today. Researchers in Seattle found that giving the devices to firefighters allowed them to revive heart victims who would have died if care were left to paramedics who arrived just minutes behind them. There is no question that this is a very, very important advance in treating prehospital cardiac arrest victims, said Dr. Donald D. Brown, who has worked with the devices at the University of Iowa.

Arevalo said that in the letter requesting permission to visit the CPR's, the CIDH did not mention this as a motive and only limited itself to saying that it wanted to observe the reintegration of refugees into the communities process.

Mary Bea Porter couldn't save her golf game, but she made a much more important save the life of a 3 year old boy. Porter was trying to qualify for next week's LPGA tournament when she jumped a 6 foot fence and revived the boy, who almost drowned Wednesday in a backyard pool bordering the Moon Valley Country Club course. Porter, 38, said she was lining up her second shot on the 13th fairway when she saw Jonathon Smucker face down in the water.

Passenger deaths during airline flights are extremely rare, but crews are not adequately prepared and medical equipment aboard airliners is insufficient to deal with the problem, researchers conclude. Airlines simply can't count on doctors being aboard flights, said Dr. Richard Cummins, one of five authors of a study published in Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association. They should take a look at the duration of the flight, the number of passengers aboard and determine what additional measures are needed, added Cummins, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Washington at Seattle.

A paramedic was strapped a stretcher Tuesday so he could continue trying to revive an accident victim as the men were hoisted from the roof of a building to a helicopter. Construction worker V. Nelson Cruz was crushed against a wall by a 25,000 pound crane counterbalance on the roof of a 13 story building, said Deputy Fire Chief R.A. Gossett. Because the victim had suffered cardiac arrest, Tony Tozzi of the Coral Gables Fire Department was strapped to the stretcher in a kneeling position so he could continue to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Investigators now believe that Spencer, who arrived in Pennsylvania eight years ago as a pregnant, 15 year old runaway, is a classic example of Munchausen's Syndrome by Proxy, a bizarre mental condition in which parents, seemingly obsessed with the well being of their children, systematically create symptoms and often inflict harm to gain attention and sympathy. ; Michigan police last month charged Spencer with murder in the September death of her son Aaron. In Clearfield County, investigators exhumed the body of another of Spencer's children, 6 week old Joyce Anne Denochick, and prosecutors are examining an autopsy done on Autumn Dawn Spencer, who died mysteriously in 1987.; Police are looking for evidence to support the woman's confession to killing all three.

SUPPORT for changes in the EC's Common Agricultural Policy, which would pay farmers to protect the environment, is coming from apparently opposed UK lobby groups.

The verdict in the trial of a Maryland nurse accused of killing hospital patients with a common substance used for a variety of medical procedures will influence how all nurses go about their jobs, a spokeswoman for a nurses organization says. Jane Bolding, formerly a nurse at the Prince George's Hospital Center about 20 miles east of the nation's capital, is accused of killing three of her intensive care patients by injecting them with lethal doses of potassium and attempting to murder two others the same way. Potassium is found naturally in the body, but in large amounts can cause cardiac arrest.

Potassium is found naturally in the body, but in large amounts can cause cardiac arrest. A guilty verdict would likely have a chilling effect on health care officials who routinely prescribe and administer common medicines like sodium bicarbonate and insulin, which can be fatal if used in large quantities, said Carol Grimaldi, a spokeswoman for the American Nurses Association, based in Kansas City, Mo.

Development of rural land in England cannot continue at the current pace and the government should conduct a far reaching review of planning and farming policies to try to protect the countryside, according to the Council for the Protection of Rural England. Tony Burton, senior planner at the CPRE, will launch the organisation's new study on the changes in regional land use between 1945 and 1990* today with a call for the government to revise its planning policies so that less rural land is used for development. The scale of development and land changes across England is 'unsustainable', Burton argues.

Attorney Mark Murphy says he learned a lesson when he used mouth to snout resuscitation to revive his drowning springer spaniel: Five minutes is a long time to blow down a dog's nose. The cardio puppy resuscitation occurred after Murphy's year old spaniel, McLean, fell into a culvert Tuesday behind Murphy's house and was swept away. I ran down to the other end and waited for him, Murphy said.

The device takes the services of a hospital emergency room directly to the victim and is expected to save many more lives, said Battalion Chief Dan Dunlap. ; It's your first aggressive approach to bringing the heart into a normal beating pattern through the use of electrical shock. We can't do that with CPR because CPR maintains blood flow and oxygenation throughout the body, but it is not always successful to bring the heart back to a normal pattern, Dunlap said.

Unreasonable fear of AIDS could cause a substantial disruption of the workplace unless employees are educated about how to deal with co workers who have the fatal disease, according to the results of a survey released Tuesday by the American Red Cross. The survey, conducted by David M. Herold of the Georgia Institute of Technology, showed that of 2,000 employees questioned across the country, 42 percent said they would not work with anyone who has AIDS. Twenty nine percent said they felt so strongly about it that they would quit their jobs before working with an AIDS patient.
