And they didn't just beat Michigan, they routed, clouted and outsmarted the champions of the Middle West. The score was 34 14, and the final margin could have been wider. The first Michigan touchdown, in the second quarter, followed a weird play in which the Wolverines got the ball on the Husky 44 yard line after Washington was penalized for interfering with a fair catch on a botched, bloop kickoff (yes, you can fair catch a kickoff).

The second came in the last period, against the Husky scrubeenies, after Washington had taken a commanding, 34 7, lead. Washington outgained Michigan almost 2 to 1, 404 yards to 205, and about half of Michigan's output came after the game had been decided.
