The Pentagon costs most congressional districts more in taxes than they get back through military spending but the situation likely will change in the 1990s because of changing budget priorities, says an economist who studies the effects of federal spending. These numbers should look quite different five or six years from now, James R. Anderson said Thursday in releasing a study that showed 321 of the 435 congressional districts lost money on the deal. The patterns are fairly stable over a long period of time, but I think we are going to see some very significant changes as we go into the '90's, in part because of base closings but also in part as we level off and perhaps significantly reduce the military budget, said Anderson, a professor of economics at Michigan State Uniersity.

Thirty of the 50 states are improving their infant mortality rates enough to meet a federal goal of reducing nationwide deaths this year to nine per 1,000 live births, according to a study by the Children's Defense Fund. The Washington based organization, which lobbies on children's issues, also said only five states have made sufficient progress to meet the goal of the U.S. surgeon general of reducing the proportion of low birthweight babies to 5 percent. Babies born with low birthweight are 20 times more likely than other infants to die in infancy and face greater risk of lifelong disabilities, the report said.

Many states are doing too little to tackle major environmental issues including solid waste disposal, water quality and protection of food supplies, according to an environmental group that conducted a national survey. Renew America, a private environmental and conservation organization, gave top ranking Tuesday to California and Oregon among the 50 states, with Tennessee and Louisiana at the bottom of the list. But the group, whose survey examined state efforts to deal with five environmental problem areas, said that overall there still is too little bele environmental problems on the state level.

Up to 360,000 truckers could lose their driving privileges if states don't step up their plans to comply with a new federal commercial driver's license law, congressional investigators say. The General Accounting Office said Monday that 33 states may not comply with a federal law that requires truck drivers to take tests and obtain federally approved commercial driver's licenses by April 1, 1992. The law aims to get unsafe drivers off the road by requiring them all to meet national standards.

Two centuries after the United States was founded as a largely agricultural nation, nearly nine tenths of the population growth is occurring in metropolitan areas, the Census Bureau reports. Almost half of all Americans reside in just 37 major urban areas, the bureau said Thursday in a new analysis of the patterns of growth. And the metropolitan share of the population is growing faster than that in rural areas.

A slowdown in population growth has taken place since 1980 in much of the interior of the United States, especially in nonmetropolitan areas, noted the report prepared by Donald E. Starsinic and Richard L. Forstall. During this decade the nonmetropolitan population declined in 10 contiguous states Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas, the bureau pointed out.

NASA spending next year will create 237,000 private industry jobs and spur $23 billion in private industry sales, according to a study commissioned by a group of former NASA employees. The NASA Alumni League said the study by Management Information Services Inc. is the first comprehensive look at the state by state industry and job effects of space agency purchasing. California, with its huge aerospace industry, is the biggest benefactor, expected to garner $6.7 billion in sales and 70,332 non government jobs created directly or indirectly by NASA related spending, the study found.

Drug agents staged dozens of raids nationwide Thursday, arresting 119 people on charges of growing marijuana indoors or selling equipment for it and seizing 65 indoor groves, the Drug Enforcement Administration said. In addition, the agents raided 22 stores that sell the equipment for the indoor marijuana growing, seizing and boarding up seven or eight of them, said DEA spokesman Frank Shults, who provided the figures as of early evening for the raids in Operation Green Merchant. The DEA planned to raid a total of 65 commercial businesses in 22 states as well as more than 100 indoor cultivation locations in 46 states on Thursday.

The Supreme Court today refused to let 30 states sue 26 manufacturers in the nation's highest court over removal of asbestos from public schools and other government buildings. The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the manufacturers should pay for such removal. Today's action does not preclude the 30 states from suing asbestos manufacturers in their respective state courts.

Much of the GI generation that fought in World War II and returned home to create an economic and baby boom is retiring in relative comfort, a Florida researcher reports. More than half of retirees age 65 to 74 have income at double the poverty level, and 12 percent form an elite with income from at least three sources, according to Charles F. Longino of the University of Miami. But elderly affluence isn't spread evenly across the nation, Longino reports in the June edition of American Demographics magazine.

Here are rankings of the healthiest states in which to live, according to a study by Northwestern National Life Insurance Company. The study compiled data from public and private health groups. The states were compared in terms of life expectancy, incidence of major illnesses, lifestyle habits such as tobacco and alcohol consumption, access to medical care, absence from of work due to illness, and mortality rates.

Here are the state rankings in the 10th annual Manufacturing Climates Study released Wednesday by the accounting firm Grant Thornton. The states are divided into two categories, high manufacturing and low manufacturing. High manufacturing states contributed more than 2 percent of the value of manufacturing shipments in the United States over the last four years and have 16.43 percent or more of their work forces in manufacturing.

High manufacturing states contributed more than 2 percent of the value of manufacturing shipments in the United States over the last four years and have 16.43 percent or more of their work forces in manufacturing. The state rankings were based on 21 factors that were narrowed to five categories: state and local fiscal policies; unemployment benefits and workers' compensation levels; labor costs; energy costs and work hours lost because of strikes; and quality of life.
