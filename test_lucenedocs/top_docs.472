Six sets of remains that may be those of missing American servicemen were flown to the United States on Thursday after a U.S. honor guard saluted and Buddhist monks prayed to console the dead. It was the first time since the Vietnam War ended in April 1975 that Communist authorities in Cambodia have delivered suspected remains of those missing in action, or MIA. The United States appreciates the support of the Phnom Penh authorities for this undertaking, said Lt. Col. Thomas Boyd, a U.S. spokesman.

BFN [Text] Phnom Penh 14 Jun (AKP) Following is the declaration made on 10 June by His Majesty the King of Cambodia: This week in Cambodia, the civil war that, alas, continues to rage and that pits units of the Cambodian Royal Armed Forces against those of the Khmer Rouge, has produced hundreds of victims among our innocent civilian compatriots, that is, nearly 100 killed and more than 100 seriously wounded (men and women and old, adults, and children) not to mention scores of the slightly wounded and those who have survived but who have lost everything (houses burned, rice, fowl, and cattle lost, and so on)... In this civil war that, alas, slowly but surely advances through our motherland and pushes our people toward certain death, there is not nor will there be any victor or vanquished among the belligerents on either side. There is and will be only a great loser, the innocent little people of Cambodia.

But a week ago, Washington announced it was withdrawing recognition of the Khmer Rouge dominated guerrilla coalition that is fighting the Phnom Penh government, and would open talks with Vietnam on ending the Cambodian civil war. Cambodia's Deputy Interior Minister Khim Ponn, head of a newly formed MIA commission, said he wanted to discuss normalization of diplomatic relations, but the Americans limited talks to the issue of missing Americans. Most of the Americans missing in Cambodia are airmen whose planes were downed during bombing raids from 1969 to 1973 on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the major supply route for the North Vietnamese into South Vietnam that wound through the mountains of eastern Cambodia.

A dedicated communist who lost an eye fighting for the Khmer Rouge in the Indochina War, Prime Minister Hun Sen has emerged as a key figure in resolving Cambodia's civil war. Once dismissed by the West as a puppet of the Vietnamese, Hun Sen is preparing to run a country that Vietnam promises will be free of all its troops by Sept. 30. In the meantime he has stepped up negotiations with Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk and others to end a guerrilla war that is sapping the country's limited resources and energy.

HIGHWAY 1, Cambodia (AP) Thousands of Vietnamese soldiers jammed the main highway in Indochina on Monday night as they snaked toward the border on the eve of Vietnam's pledged exit from a nearly 11 year old war. Soviet made armored personnel carriers, American made trucks, jeeps and artillery and Chinese Liberation troop transport vehicles clogged the 20 foot wide stretch of highway for 120 miles from Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, to the Vietnamese border. Traffic on the road that Vietnam used as one of its main invasion in December 1978 came to a standstill.

Prime Minister Hun Sen on Sunday said a full scale civil war can be averted if other nations stop arming the guerrillas once Vietnam withdraws its troops from Cambodia. He said at a news conference that bloodshed is inevitable after the Vietnamese forces backing his government are gone, but that the level of fighting depends on foreign aid to the insurgents. Officials on both sides of the conflict have predicted new offensives by the guerrillas after this week's withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.

With a blessing by Buddhist monks, six sets of human remains were flown out of Cambodia today for tests to see whether they are the bones of Americans missing from the Vietnam War. It was the first time since the end of the war in 1975 that communist Cambodia has allowed the repatriation of suspected remains of those missing in action, or MIA. A somber American military honor guard escorted six flag draped aluminum caskets on board a U.S. Air Force C 141 that took off for Hawaii, where the remains will undergo forensic examination to try to identify them.

A new U.N. peace plan for Cambodia has again raised hopes for ending the civil war, but many past efforts have failed after initial optimism. The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday proposed a U.N. interim administration in Cambodia until a new government is elected. They envisaged deploying up to 20,000 U.N. personnel, including a peacekeeping force, to bolster a truce and guide the nation to democracy.

BFN [Text] Australia's Foreign Minister Gareth Evans has called on the rebel Cambodian guerrilla faction, the Khmer Rouge, to end its war and talk peace with the government in Phnom Penh. Senator Evans told journalists in the Cambodian capital that the Khmer Rouge was a diminishing force with no credibility. He said the guerrillas continue to loose their power and influence and predicted that Cambodian Government troops would remain in control of the faction's former stronghold of Pailin, which they captured last month.

A fresh push will likely be made to wrap up negotiations with the Soviet Union on reducing long range nuclear weapons. In December, 1987, President Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate range Nuclear Forces treaty which provides for eliminating all U.S. and Soviet land based missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3,400 miles. The Bush administration also will closely monitor the moves of the 12 nation European Economic Community, or Common Market, to form a single market by the end of 1992.

The Reagan administration stressed it welcomed the easing of tensions between the two giants and expressed faith in Chinese assertions they will never return to the relationship of the 1950s when Beijing was a subservient ally of Moscow. But George Bush, a former U.S. ambassador to China, will need to take a new look at how China figures in American strategic interests when Mikhail S. Gorbachev's meeting with Deng Xiaoping formally makes America's China card obsolete.

Marked by wars, deep economic problems and social and political instability, Central America poses new foreign policy questions for the Bush administration in 1989. The president will have to decide if he will continue the Reagan administration's funding for the Contra rebels in their attempt to oust the almost 10 year old leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. Bush, shortly after his election, indicated he might take a more diplomatic approach with the Sandinistas.

At the end of these elections which I, Norodom Sihanouk, would be responsible for organizing and supervising the PDK would probably win seats within our National Assembly, besides the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia], the CPP [Cambodian People's Party], the BLDP [Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party], and so on.

The World Food Program moved cautiously in appealing for aid because some of the other refugees, in Kompongspeu and Kompong Chhnang provinces, said the government had moved them out of their villages because of guerrilla infiltration. At the donor meeting, Sweden pledged $6.6 million for aid inside Cambodia. The United States pledged $10 million and the European Community $6 million to help about 300,000 refugees in Thai border camps controlled by the guerrillas.

<P> A senior Bush Administration official Friday called on the Soviet Union to hold down its shipments of arms to Cambodia and complained that the level of shipments has risen as Vietnam prepares to withdraw its troops from that country. </P> <P> In a speech to an international symposium on Indochina, Richard H. Solomon, assistant secretary of state for East Asia, also urged China to limit its supply of arms to the Khmer Rouge, the radical Communist faction blamed for the deaths of more than 1 million people when it ruled the country between 1975 and early 1979. </P> <P> Solomon's remarks suggested that the Bush Administration is making a last ditch effort to work with the Soviet Union and China in trying to prevent civil war from widening in Cambodia within the next few weeks.

Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Cambodian Premier Hun Sen signed a communique today that called for an end to hostilities but stopped short of announcing a cease fire in Cambodia's 11 year old civil war. The powerful communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who are part of a three faction rebel coalition Sihanouk heads, boycotted the session. The statement said the factions should refrain from all offensive actions and there should be measures to ensure a military standstill.
