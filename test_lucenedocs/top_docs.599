The man who gave the University of Notre Dame a sweater worn by football legend George Gipp says he is stunned the university gave it away even to Ronald Reagan. Belatedly, I now regret not stipulating that the Gipp monogram would be on loan, ' said John N. Cackley in an opinion column in Friday's South Bend Tribune. I never dreamed that someone at Notre Dame would go to the extreme of satisfying egos in the White House and at the university just to create an atmosphere of good old fashioned show biz, ' said Cackley, a 1937 graduate and executive director emeritus of the alumni association.

The University of Notre Dame bucked the College Football Association and became the first college to sell its home football games to a major network by agreeing Monday to a five year contract with NBC beginning in 1991. ABC and ESPN thought they had acquired rights to Notre Dame home games when they agreed to exclusive contracts with the CFA, which consists of 64 schools. But the deal by the Fighting Irish, a member of the CFA, created the possibility that other colleges might defect from the CFA's package.

President Reagan revisited the University of Notre Dame on Wednesday and dedicated a new 22 cent stamp in honor of Knute Rockne, telling students that the legendary football coach's life exemplified the faith that makes things happen. It was Reagan's second visit as president to the Notre Dame campus. On his earlier visit in 1981, he was reunited with Pat O'Brien, who played the title role in the 1940 movie, Knute Rockne, All American, in which Reagan enjoyed one of the first big successes of his Hollywood career.

Public station KQED TV, which pioneered the annual auction as a fund raising mechanism 36 years ago, said Aug. 30 it was ending the practice because of dwindling audiences. Jon Abbott, KQED's vice president for marketing and development, said the 1990 auction raised $550,000 on costs of $350,000, a narrower margin than in previous years. Abbott said recent audiences were so small as to be unmeasurable in the Nielsen ratings.
