Convergent Technologies Inc., battered by slumping margins in its core computer business and high marketing costs for new products, posted a first quarter loss of $11 million. The company previously had forecast a loss of at least $9.6 million. In the 1986 first quarter, Convergent had a restated net income of $2.1 million, or five cents a share.

Convergent Technologies Inc., still woozy from losing most of a large original equipment manufacturing contract with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., reported a narrower fourth quarter loss. The computer and software concern's $4.5 million loss, which compares with a loss of $6.3 million in the year ago quarter, resulted from nonrecurring charges totaling $4.9 million.

In the UK a group of dedicated contract electronics manufacturers have successfully shaken off the second rate 'sweat shop' image of sub contract and assembly work in the 1960s by investing heavily in advanced production and test equipment, training and quality processes. Today their big customers are blue chip multinationals such as IBM, Sony, Bosch, Motorola, AEG, and Matsushita which require fast response times, flexibility and first class quality, as well as cost effective manufacturing.

IBM's operating expenses and manufacturing costs are now 'almost at parity' with industry competitors, Mr Jones says. There is a new 'fire in the belly' of its product divisions; a new determination to beat external competitors rather than squabble among internal divisions, he believes. The decline in IBM's mainframe computer business will bottom out in 1995 1996, Mr Jones predicts.

ON the surface, the French automotive components industry had a reasonable year in 1992, although there have also been some suggestions that the sector was heading for difficulties in view of such factors as the 'franc fort' pegged to the strength of the Deutschemark within the ERM; a shake out of the number of suppliers to both Renault and the PSA group; and the downward pressure on the prices of bought in components exerted by France's vehicle manufacturers. The most worrying factor for 1993, however, has been the steep downturn in vehicle output which has characterised the first few months. Staring at the abyss by late 1992, the components industry has seen production in France of passenger cars fall by 13.6 per cent in the four months to the end of April, as compared with the performance of the comparable period of 1992.

The company's chairman, chief executive officer and founder, Mr Stan Shih, says he is in the process of transforming Acer into a multinational computer company, capable of competing with the main global players. According to Mr Shih: 'Our aim is to motivate Taiwan's people to succeed in removing the negative image of 'Made in Taiwan'.

Honeywell said it plans to provide its airline customers with an easy to use information system. The cockpit Macintosh computers will also be able to run standard PC software. 'This provides airborne software application compatibility with computer systems on the ground, and should help to incorporate more fully the aircraft into an airline's overall information management system,' said Mr Mark Anderson, Honeywell's lead engineer for the ELS project.

However, the IBM relationship may give Wang credibility with customers at a time when sales of its own computers have steadily weakened, revenue is shrinking and losses have been continuing. In an action that helped cement what the two companies called a strategic business relationship, IBM will make a $25 million investment in Wang to buy convertible securities that could be converted into a 3% or 4% stake in Wang's Class B stock. It may also make further investments of as much as $75 million, depending on Wang's performance.

TRADE officials in Brussels negotiating with the rest of the world to reduce tariffs are finding themselves in the middle of a bitter debate between Europe's semiconductor makers and its users and both sides claim the outcome could make or break Europe's electronics industry. During the current round of multilateral talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the EC has offered to lower import tariffs on various goods by 30 per cent. This offer would apply to the existing 14 per cent import duty on semiconductors.
