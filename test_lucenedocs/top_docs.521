Rascal, a dolphin rescued from a cold Virginia bay after failing to migrate to warmer waters, is going home after five weeks of Southern hospitality. The dolphin gained 30 pounds on a diet of smelt and herring and is healthy enough to be returned to the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday, Becca Moore, a spokeswoman for Sea World in Orlando, Fla., said Tuesday. Rascal also was treated for parasites during his stay, she said.

A young dolphin that has refused to leave Broad Bay's chilly waters for six weeks despite two federal rescue attempts is being trained to survive the winter. Because he's young, he would normally be in a herd of dolphins and depend on the experience of older animals for guidance, Joseph R. Geraci, a U.S. Marine Mammal Commission veterinarian, said Sunday. Without that guidance, his greatest need as I see it is for social contact.

A bottlenose dolphin has become stranded in the chilly waters off Virginia Beach after failing to migrate south this fall, and authorities are planning a risky rescue to try to reunite it with its brethren. The dolphin, nicknamed Rascal, was spotted in early October in Broad Bay, and residents around the bay began requesting that the government do something to save it. On Monday, the National Marine Fisheries Service agreed that the animal's life was in jeopardy and that an attempt should be made to save it.

Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN <F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong kil: The National Security Law </F> Must Be Abolished ] [Text] As has already been reported, on 3 March, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher acknowledged that a U.S. official's recent remarks which demanded that the National Security Law [NSL] of South Korea be abolished were not an individual's private opinion, but the official position of the United States. The final acknowledgment made by the U.S. secretary of state on the United States' official position towards this law came out because the South Korean puppets were clamoring that U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hubbard's remarks calling for the abolition of the NSL in his speech at American University on 25 February were merely an individual's opinion. This proceeded from the present U.S. administration's acknowledgment that one of the reasons for the failure in progress in dialogue and negotiation between the North and the South of Korea lies in South Korea's NSL, and this is, albeit belated, very fortunate.

Divers and scientists failed again today to rescue a bottlenose dolphin that became stranded in the chilly waters off this coastal community after neglecting to migrate south for the winter.

The effort was then suspended until Jan. 4 to reassess strategy and get a stronger net, said Robert Helfant, captain of the emergency medical services dive team in Virginia Beach.

He's not weak at all, he said. Still, he added, the mammal remained in danger from the cold water. If the 200 to 300 pound dolphin is caught, he will be airlifted by a Coast Guard helicopter to waters off North Carolina's Outer Banks.

He also said the mammal was frightened by the number of rescue boats and by the net. Residents believe the dolphin lingered in the bay long after fellow dolphins headed south because he was frightened by bridge construction over a narrow channel leading to the open waters of Chesapeake Bay.

All the compatriots in the North, South, and overseas, on hearing the New Year address, fervently support and welcome the principled stance regarding the fatherland's reunification clarified by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il song and turn out in a struggle to implement it, saying that it is a programmatic guideline that breaks a deadlock lying in the way of the reunification and peacefully expedites the cause of the country's reunification by means of the nation's independent strength. The South Korean warmongers clique, however, gathered in one place, hatched the war conspiracy and enumerated provocative outbursts.

IBC VEHICLES, the UK based 60/40 joint venture between General Motors and Isuzu, staged a strong recovery in 1992 with pre tax profits of Pounds 5.2m against losses of Pounds 28m in the previous year. The company, formed in the late 1980s from the former loss making Bedford van operations in Luton, more than tripled turnover to Pounds 426m, compared with Pounds 133.7m. Production was more than doubled to 48,452 (20,932) vehicles as a result of the successful build up of output of the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera four wheel drive leisure utility vehicle.

This helps along the impression that they aren't really worth writing about, and may have kept the better novelists off their trail.

He added bellicose absurd remarks that when circumstances do not permit dialogue, it was also the government's consistent stance to take strict measures against the North. These very dangerous provocative absurd remarks are leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to a phase of war [chonjaeng kungmyon] and are outraging our people.

These very dangerous provocative absurd remarks are leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to a phase of war [chonjaeng kungmyon] and are outraging our people. As everyone knows, the whole world recognizes that the nuclear issue in our country is an issue to be resolved between us and the United States. The reason the nuclear issue has been raised on the Korean peninsula is because the United States is increasing the risk of nuclear war [haekchonjaeng wihom] by introducing more than 1,000 nuclear weapons of various types to South Korea; is deploying them in forward positions in the areas adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line; and is conducting nuclear war exercises, including the Team Spirit military exercise, against the Northern half of the Republic every day.

It came as no surprise to anyone in Latin America that a novelist, poet and essayist, Mario Vargas Llosa, would seek to become president of Peru. For Vargas Llosa, frequently mentioned as a future winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, is following a centuries old tradition of an area where cultural figures, both classical and pop, have also played important political roles. Peru's Vice President Luis Alberto Sanchez, himself a writer and educator as well as politician, says that in Latin America individuals who have distinguished themselves in literature and art can carry their prestige into politics because they live in half finished societies that value men of multiple talents.

This is for the animal's best health and welfare at this time, said Douglas Beach, a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

Traitor Kim Yong sam's antireunification color was eloquently illustrated in his theory on the uselessness of reunification which claimed that unless free democracy and market economy are guaranteed, reunification is worse than division. His antireunification nature was also clearly shown in his so called three stage reunification plan which assumes reunification of the system [chedo tongil], which may evoke confrontation and war between fellow countrymen, as a precondition for national reunification. Many South Korean people unanimously criticized traitor Kim Yong sam's three stage reunification plan as keeping intact the main point of the Korean people's commonwealth national reunification plan.

In his New Year address and in the New Year press conference early this year, rascal Kim Yong sam made no mention of reunification, and merely made provocative remarks slandering fellow countrymen.

All successive puppets in South Korea repeatedly committed maneuvers for national division. However, no group was as wicked and cunning as separatist maniacs as the Kim Yong sam clique. Today, when all fellow countrymen unanimously rise as one in the patriotic reunification movement in order to make 1995 the first year for national reunification, the Kim Yong sam group wields a bayonet against the people calling for national reconciliation and unity and totally froze North South dialogue which existed even in times of military dictatorship.
