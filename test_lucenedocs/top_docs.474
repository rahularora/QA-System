When it became clear that the Space Age was upon us and the need to put a human into Earth orbit became a matter of national urgency, a massive backlog of aerospace technology was already at hand in the X 15 program, said John V. Becker of NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va. Years later, the space shuttle's landing characteristics would be designed to emulate the X 15.

Twenty years ago, a delta winged wonder known as the Concorde 001 took off on its maiden flight, lifting off gracefully from an airstrip in southern France and becoming the fastest commercial jet in the sky. About 3,000 people gathered in a hangar on Thursday to toast the event and to promote plans for a second generation Concorde to carry passengers into the 21st century at twice the speed of sound. Plans for the new jet were unveiled Wednesday at Aerospatiale offices in the southern French city of Toulouse.

It's either the NASP, the National Aerospace Plane, or better yet the X 30, next in a string of experimental planes that began with Chuck Yeager's X 1, breaker of the sound barrier. When President Reagan made his rosy prediction about the Orient Express, a week after the Challenger space shuttle disaster, engineers had already taken years to decide the X 30 was possible.

A fighter plane that combines long range supersonic cruise capability with a greatly enhanced ability to dogfight at and above the speed of sound has long been an elusive dream of aircraft designers. After 5{ years of research the solution to that engineering enigma may be near at NASA's Langley Research Center, where aeronautical visionaries believe they have seen the future in something called the vortex flap. The flap, with a distinctive, sharp downward angle, is designed to improve the agility of swept wing jets.

Smith, a 30 year veteran of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who is flight project engineer for the vortex flap experiment. The acute deflection of the wing's leading edge purposely detaches the airflow over the wing and forms a tornado like vortex on the flap.

Britain's Prince Andrew waved to his wife, Sarah, as he streaked overhead in a jet catapulted from the deck of the aircraft carrier Nimitz on Thursday during a tour off the California coast. The airshow was a highlight of the day at sea for the Duke and Duchess of York, both pilots, who also inspected one of the catapults and the massive chains that hold the ship's two 60,000 pound anchors. This is one of the loneliest walks I've ever done, the prince said moments before he boarded the S 3A Viking anti submarine warfare jet while Sarah remained on deck.

While there may be no quick answers to the tragedy of Pan Am Flight 103, the wreckage scattered across the Scottish countryside has left enough clues to make it virtually certain the cause will be found, aviation experts said Friday. As more information surfaced, specialists noted the similarities between Wednesday's crash of the Boeing 747 in Scotland that killed all 258 people aboard and leaving at least 17 people missing on the ground, and the crash three years ago of an Air India jumbo jet off the Irish coast. Indian officials after months of retrieving wreckage from the ocean floor concluded that a bomb exploded aboard the Air India jetliner.

In spite of accusations of noise pollution and aircraft emissions, most airports are extremely environmentally conscious. Airport managements, especially in Europe, are not only aware that they can be penalised if they transgress the regulations, but they are also just as concerned as local populations with the well being of the areas in which they themselves live and work. Many existing activities, especially in Europe and North America, are already constrained by governmental regulatory requirements.

Use of titanium alloy on the SR 71 rather than standard aluminum made flight at high speed possible despite 800 degree Fahrenheit temperatures. The Blackbird flies at more than 2,000 mph and above 85,000 feet.

The first man to break the sound barrier, retired Air Force Gen. Chuck Yeager, says he was duped into promoting a theme park for military veterans that was to be built in western South Dakota. Dressed in cowboy boots, jeans and a windbreaker, Yeager testified Wednesday in U.S. District Court at the trial of four men accused of bilking investors and creditors out of more than $800,000. Yeager, 65, who flew faster than the speed of sound in 1947 and who continues to work as a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base in California, said after testifying, When some guy uses you, it ticks you off.

The Republican presidential campaign has pulled out heavy artillery in the form of retired U.S. Air Force Gen. Chuck Yeager to warn Texans that liberal Democrats will take away jobs from the state's defense industry. In a television advertisement airing this week in Texas, Yeager warns that the 300,000 Texas jobs related to the defense industry could be jeopardized by Democrats who advocate cuts in defense spending. But Yeager, the first man to break the sound barrier, has worked for the past six years as a consultant to Northrop Corp. of California, a competitor of General Dynamics Corp.

When Chuck Yeager uses the phrase, the right stuff, he's talking about the way golden trout tastes when you cook it over an open fire with wild onions, pulled fresh out of the ground. In Press On: Further Adventures in the Good Life (with Charles Leerhsen, Bantam, 247 pages, $17.95), he confesses that he still doesn't know what Tom Wolfe meant by the phrase when he made it the title of his best selling book about pilots. Tom Wolfe made a lot of money off it, but it's not something I've ever heard a pilot say.

At one moment, the high speed plane seemed to stall dead still, pulled its nose straight up, and flipped over on its back. Apollon Systvov, the Soviet Aeronautics Industry Minister, later told a news conference the relaxation of international tensions and more openness in his country made it possible for greater participation by the Soviets at this year's show.

He established the National Space Council, headed by Vice President Dan Quayle, to recommend a comprehensive space policy.

King Radio Corp., a unit of Allied Signal Inc., developed the avionics. And Hercules Inc. and Hexcel Corp., makers of composite materials, helped build the molded structure, which they hope will demonstrate the use of lightweight composites to replace metal in aircraft frames. I heard they had this project going and told them we had a low fuel consumption engine they should take a look at, says Donald Bigler, president of Teledyne Continental Motors Inc., Mobile, Ala.

EDITOR'S NOTE It flies to more than 17 miles high, out of harm's way, at three times the speed of sound, faster than a bullet. The SR 71, the original stealth jet called the Blackbird, is 25 years old now but it still holds world records for speed and altitude. As one Air Force pilot says, The SR 71 excites the boy in all of us who love to fly.
 AP880606-0223 
The SR 71 suddenly flashes into view out of nowhere, like a star ship in the movies. Shaped like a dagger, black and sinister, it slices cloud puffs in an otherwise blue sky as it climbs slowly to mate with a refueling air tanker. This is the Blackbird, the original stealth jet that rockets at 2,100 mph to the edge of space as it spies on global hot spots out of reach of attack.
