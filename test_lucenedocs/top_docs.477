Ford Motor Co.'s Merkur, the company's first new car franchise in the U.S. since the Edsel was unveiled in 1957, now will share Edsel's fate. Ford said yesterday it will halt imports of the Merkur Scorpio, a $28,000 luxury sedan built by Ford of Europe in West Germany. The cars are sold under a separate franchise with its own sign in front of Lincoln Mercury dealers as opposed to new models such as Taurus or Escort, which are sold under existing Ford divisions.

<P> Ford to End Scorpio Imports: Ford Motor Co. said it will no longer import its German built Scorpio luxury sedan, in effect dissolving its Merkur franchises at Lincoln Mercury dealers after nearly five years of disappointing results. Ford said it will not offer a 1990 model of its $28,400 Scorpio sedan because of the high costs of equipping it with passive restraints and decreasing luxury car sales in the U.S. Ford executives had recently said they remained committed to the Merkur franchise. </P>

Ford Motor Co. said it raised the base price of its new Merkur Scorpio 3.4%, or $800, to $24,048. The company said the move was in response to cost pressures, including strengthening of the West German mark against the dollar. The Scorpio, a five passenger luxury car, is built in West Germany.

FORD OF Europe is cutting production at its car assembly plant in Cologne, Germany, in response to falling sales in western Europe and excessive stocks. It is stopping production of the top of the range Scorpio/Granada for three weeks beginning October 19 and is stopping output of its Fiesta small car for one week from the same date. The production cuts in Germany, the first for many years, are in addition to similar moves already announced at other Ford plants in Europe.

Undercover police guided by the stars staked out various points in the city in their quest for the Zodiac killer, whose 21 day pattern of shootings led investigators to suspect he would strike again today. Police consulted astrological charts, occult books, FBI psychological profiles and letters scrawled by the gunman in selecting their positions. The gunman has vowed in his letters to shoot 12 people, one for each sign of the zodiac.

It is no longer fashionable to say so, but a large engine and automatic transmission in a chassis designed for high speed driving are the makings of a really fine car. The Scorpio's stiff suspension and even fatter 50 series Pirelli P700 tyres give a driver handling and cornering capability he can not responsibly exploit off a circuit. There is nothing wrong with the suspension's basic shock absorbency.

Ford Motor Co. said it is recalling about 18,000 of its 1988 and 1989 model Merkur Scorpio cars equipped with 2.9 liter engines, because of a throttle position sensor problem that could affect engine performance. The Dearborn, Mich., auto maker said that if the sensor sticks, the engine might idle roughly or too fast, or might run poorly or stumble when the transmission is shifted into the drive position. A spokesman said Ford isn't aware of any accidents or injuries related to this problem.

Ford's Granada and Scorpio executive models yesterday joined the list of vehicles where manufacturers are slashing or eliminating dealer profit margins in order to cut list prices and the company car tax liability of purchasers. Ford would not disclose the sizes of the cuts in dealer margins but they reduce the list price of the dearest model, the Scorpio 2.9 litre 24 valve estate, to Pounds 26,545 including value added tax from Pounds 29,310. The cheapest model, the Executive 2.0L, falls to Pounds 15,995 from Pounds 18,100.

New York's so called Zodiac gunman may be going by the book that details the San Francisco Zodiac killer's rampage, top city police officials said. The book, Zodiac, by Robert Graysmith, includes boastful letters sent by the San Francisco killer to newspapers during the late 1960s and early 1970s, claiming responsibility for a series of murders and taunting the police to catch him.

Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, Mich., said it is discontinuing its Merkur XR4Ti line at the end of 1989 model year. The company said it will stop importing the West German made luxury sports car because it couldn't attract enough buyers to Lincoln Mercury showrooms to meet sales projections; the car never really fit with Lincoln Mercury's more traditional American image. The auto maker also said the low sales volumes didn't justify the costs necessary to make technological changes, most notably the need to install air bags by 1990.

Its Escort and Mondeo turbo diesels have gained so much power and refinement that they can now hold up their heads in the company of, say, the VW Golf, Citroen Xantia and Peugeot 405. The latest Granada/Scorpio turbo diesel, with an Italian VM 2.5 litre engine and very tall gearing (90 mph/145 kmh at only 3,000 rpm), wafts along motorways with the silence of the chairman's limousine. Vauxhall, using turbo charged engines made by Isuzu, General Motors' Japanese associate, first doubled and then trebled its diesel sales this year.

Push it hard and it goes (indeed, even sounds) like a sporty BMW but it pulls fifth gear silkily at less than 30 mph/50 kph and will yield 40 mpg (7 litres/100km) on a journey.

John Damoose, vice president, sales and marketing, said he didn't know if parent Chrysler Corp. would make a similar guarantee for Premiers sold in the U.S. A Chrysler Canada spokesman previously described the program as a dry run for possible sales incentives in the U.S. Mr. Damoose said the plan will cover original buyers of 1988 Premiers who buy or lease a Jeep or Eagle vehicle 24 to 48 months later. He said Chrysler will give them a cash payment or discount if any of seven other midsized cars retain a greater percentage of their original value at that time.

It shows that Audi's 100 series of models continues to lead the European popularity league for management chariots as it has done since at least 1988 with the VW marque relatively nowhere. Even so, let's leave leadership contests aside for the moment and consider the survey, which Wyatt carries out every two years from its office in Brussels.

FORD, the US carmaker, is considering the development of a new medium sized luxury car as its next world car programme in North America and Europe. The programme would include a version for Jaguar, its UK luxury car subsidiary. The programme opens the possibility of building a car under the Jaguar name for the first time outside the UK, although Jaguar's preferred option would still be to assemble the vehicle at its main Coventry plant.

Ford Motor Co. and Saab Scania AB of Sweden broke off talks about a possible alliance after Ford officials concluded that the cost to modernize Saab's car operations would outweigh the likely return. With the collapse of the talks Friday, European analysts expect Ford to intensify its pursuit of British luxury car maker Jaguar PLC, which is scrambling to fend off a hostile Ford bid by negotiating a friendly alliance with Ford's archrival, General Motors Corp. Saab, meanwhile, is left to continue its search for an ally to shore up its sagging car business. Saab said last week it has had and will continue to have contacts with other manufacturers.

Mr Jacques Nasser, Ford of Europe chairman, said the US carmaker's European operations (excluding Jaguar, Ford's UK luxury car subsidiary) had remained in loss in 1993, but had achieved 'a substantial improvement' from 1992. Ford had hoped to return to break even in Europe this year (excluding Jaguar), but had been hit by the prolonged fall in new car demand. Its plants have operated at only around 70 per cent of capacity.

The city's Zodiac gunman became a killer Sunday when a 78 year old man died, 3{ weeks after he was shot in the back by the letter writing attacker, a hospital administrator said. Joseph Proce, the third of four people the gunman shot, went into cardiac arrest at Jamaica General Hospital at 10:25 a.m. and died about 40 minutes later, said administrator Ole Pedersen. Proce, who walked with a cane, was shot in the back as he walked near his Queens home on May 31.
