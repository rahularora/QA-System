Authorities on Monday quarantined three mixed breed dogs that attacked and killed a 73 year old woman as she picked up a newspaper in her front yard. A neighbor used a baseball bat to run off the dogs, but Frances Fletcher died shortly after the attack Sunday. The state attorney's office Monday was considering criminal charges against Sidney Bodie and Scherrie Laramore, neighbors who owned the dogs, Jacksonville sheriff's spokesman Asa Higgs said.

The gruesome death of an elderly woman after an attack by two pit bull terriers has revived a legal dogfight between pet owners and authorities over the regulation of vicious canines. The issue centers on whether cities should pass ordinances specifically citing pit bulls a breed the American Kennel Club says does not exist among its 141 registered varieties. Animal control officers and politicians have adopted an I know one when I see one stance, and insist the dogs that fit the general pit bull description are more vicious than others and need to be regulated more closely.

The main victims of fatal dog bites were the very young and very old, those least able to protect themselves, the researchers said. The death rate for newborns, less than a month old, was 370 times higher than that for adults ages 30 to 49, they said, and the rate for infants, less than a year old, was 85 times higher than for adults in that group. For people 70 or over, the rate was almost 11 times higher than for the 30 to 49 group.

The Supreme Court today left intact an Overland Park, Kan., ordinance restricting the ownership and possession of pit bull dogs. The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the city ordinance is unconstitutionally too vague. Lawyers for 13 owners of dogs told the justices the 1987 ordinance does not even attempt to offer a standard for the police or dog owners to use when trying to determine whether a particular dog is subject to the ordinance.

Local humane society officials are pressing for an ordinance to ban all breeding of dogs and cats. It's not that they are against puppies and kittens, they just want to stop killing 10,000 unwanted animals each year. The debate over the proposed breeding ban is shaping into a class battle fought by responsible pet owners and breeders of aristocratic pets, and shelter workers who must euthanize thousands of those pets' poorer cousins each year.

The city is getting tough on the pugnacious pit bull dog, barring the breed from taking up future residence and requiring photos and tattoos of those already here. The Board of Health adopted a Health Code amendment Monday that requires that all pit bull terriers be registered, spayed or neutered and identified by photographs and tattooing. The regulations, which go into effect in 30 days, also require that the animals be muzzled whenever there is any potential contact with the public, that they be on a leash when outside the owner's home and that signs be posted on the premises indicating the presence of a pit bull.
