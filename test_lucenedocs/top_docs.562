Mr. Koenig said the agency doesn't plan to name a successor; he said the Los Angeles office will continue to be run by general manager Don Cunningham, while the agency's Irvine, Calif., office, known as Cochran Chase, Livingston will continue to be headed by its president, Lynn Livingston.

GJW Government Relations is one of the best lobbying firms around. It is also one of the canniest when it comes to making money. Having sold out for Pounds 6.5m to a company headed by Frank Lowe and Sir Tim Bell just before the 1987 stock market crash, the three key figures, Andrew Gifford, Wilf Weeks and Jenny Jeger, have bought back their business now owned by Interpublic for next to nothing.

If GJW does well, so will Interpublic. But given that GJW is three times bigger, and profitable, than it was when Gifford and his pals last sold it, they seem to have got a bargain.

If GJW does well, so will Interpublic. But given that GJW is three times bigger, and profitable, than it was when Gifford and his pals last sold it, they seem to have got a bargain. It also means that they can compete head on with Sir Tim Bell's outfit without having to bother about the conflicts of interest which forced them to sit on the sidelines during Hanson's stalking of ICI, because Sir Tim was working for the opposition.
