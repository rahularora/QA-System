But last year, the Clark bar's owner, the Leaf Inc. unit of Huhtamaki Oy, of Finland, announced it would close the candy's manufacturing plant in Pittsburgh if a buyer couldn't be found. Leaf tried to turn the once profitable regional confection into a national brand when the candy industry consolidated in the 1980s, only to find it lacked the marketing clout of better financed rivals. When news of the sweet's impending demise reached Clark University in Worcester, Mass., the great candy crusade began.

Dick Clark is justifiably proud of his place in rock 'n' roll history, but he admits he wouldn't have minded being a headliner instead of a host. My only regret is that I didn't study more on the piano, Clark said in a recent interview. I've gotten awards where I'm mentioned in the same company of musicians, and while it makes me proud, it also humbles me.

This month, when Giant and Barris bought a stake in a company called Clark Equipment, one Barris game show writer thought he finally had figured out the logic of at least one deal.
