<P> Los Angeles County on Wednesday sweetened its offer in the competition with Anaheim to become the Southern California terminus of a futuristic high speed rail system to Las Vegas. </P> <P> To raise the chances of a northern San Fernando Valley terminus, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission voted Wednesday to study speeding up construction of a light rail line linking Los Angeles International Airport to Sylmar. </P> <P> Los Angeles County officials said that link would significantly increase ridership on a Sylmar to Las Vegas line because it would tie the high speed system to the county's network of rail lines, three of which are under construction, with several more in the planning stage.

At least 265 residents of the Antelope Valley, a desert area 60 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, began receiving the computer generated letters Nov. 1.

A partnership made a formal bid Monday on a $5 billion high speed train system that would whisk riders from Southern California to the casinos of the Strip in little more than an hour. The partnership headed by Bechtel International Inc. of San Francisco proposed the first commercial use of magnetically levitated trains that would run up to 300 mph on an about 270 mile line between Las Vegas and Anaheim. The bid for exclusive franchise rights was hailed as a milestone for the project, which was first proposed in 1979.

A decade after a high speed train linking this gaming community and Southern California was first proposed, a partnership today plunked down $500,000 along with the first formal bid on the $5 billion project. Bechtel International Inc. of San Francisco and Transrapid of West Germany are expected to be the only bidders for the right to build a train that would cruise up to 300 mph on elevated track running alongside interstate highways between Las Vegas and Anaheim, Calif. The bidding deadline is later today.

Kerkorian, 72, had sold and bought back pieces of MGM UA Communications for two decades, a period during which he also traded Las Vegas hotels the way most people buy cars. Last month, Australia's Qintex Group agreed to purchase MGM UA including the original lion logo for $1.5 billion. Kerkorian continues to shun the spotlight and is reluctant to talk about his business success.

Not only would Congress have to act to make the German engineered train eligible for such bonds, but the amount needed far exceeds the annual limit on private purpose, tax exempt bonds that can be issued by California and Nevada.

The wreckage of a plane believed to be carrying 10 people from Las Vegas was found today in the mountains, along with at least nine bodies, authorities said. The private, twin engine plane, which reportedly carried a family en route to Disneyland, crashed Sunday near the top of a brushy ridge in the Santa Ana Mountains southeast of Los Angeles. It appeared the aircraft had nearly cleared the ridgetop at about the 2,200 foot level at the time of the crash.

Mayor Pete Sferrazza says life in this 24 hour city where divorces are easy and slot machines clang in both casinos and supermarkets isn't as stressful as one researcher claims.

I don't think it's an accurate picture of what life is like in Reno, Sferrazza said of the ranking reported in Psychology Today.

Some of the record 20 tons of cocaine seized last week apparently was stored earlier in warehouses in El Paso, Texas, and across that city's border with Mexico, drug enforcement officials said. Seven men arrested in the case four in Los Angeles and three in Las Vegas were expected to be arraigned before federal magistrates today. On Friday, the day after investigators stumbled upon the Los Angeles warehouse, officials raided six warehouses in El Paso and three homes in Juarez, across the Rio Grande.

Rival Colombian drug cartels may be joining forces to keep smuggling and distribution lines open during their government's crackdown, a federal agent investigating a record cocaine seizure said Monday. Drug agents were surprised to find cocaine from both the Medellin and Cali cartels in a Los Angeles warehouse that housed 20 tons of cocaine, said John M. Zienter, the Drug Enforcement Administration's special agent for Los Angeles. It very well could be that, based on the pressure in Colombia, this is a way cartels are trying to get much of the cocaine out of the country and to maintain distribution channels, said Zienter, who declined to say exactly how much of the cocaine was from the two cartels named for the cities where they are based.
