The hunt, accompanied by dozens of calls from all over the Dutch capital reporting unidentified flying objects, failed to yield anything extra terrestrial, according to spokesman Klaas Wilting. We were alerted late Thursday night by Schiphol (airport) air traffic controllers who observed bright lights in a stationary position over the port area which didn't show up on their radar screens, Wilting said.

Armed with posters, a skit and speeches, second graders from Valley Elementary School in Bensalem lobbied the House Committee on Conservation to approve legislation Tuesday naming the phacops rana as the state fossil. Phacops rana were kings of the ocean floor millions of years ago, said 8 year old Nicky Lepone, a spokesman for his 120 classmates.

Already the lab has created a smart manufacturing system that will help automate some production in weapons plants.

Now work is under way to create a system that can clean up toxic areas too dangerous for humans to venture into at Department of Energy weapons plants, such as Hanford, Wash.; Savannah River, Ga.; Oak Ridge, Tenn.; Fernald, Ohio, and Pantex, Texas.

Now work is under way to create a system that can clean up toxic areas too dangerous for humans to venture into at Department of Energy weapons plants, such as Hanford, Wash.; Savannah River, Ga.; Oak Ridge, Tenn.; Fernald, Ohio, and Pantex, Texas. Scientists say a robotic backhoe will be used at highly radioactive and toxic pits, along with a 40 foot robotic arm with sight and radar capabilities that can scan a dump, map pipes and other obstacles, vacuum sand and dirt, lift and remove drums, and clean leaking underground storage tanks.

Neither lawsuits, nor TV cameras, nor vandals in the dead of night were able, in the end, to stop the long postponed rendezvous between a microbe and a strawberry leaf. Advanced Genetic Sciences Inc. dispatched a heavily suited sprayer at dawn Friday to test its Frostban bacteria known scientifically as pseudomonas syringae on less than an acre of strawberry plants about 30 miles east of San Francisco. The bacteria have been altered by the deletion of a gene for a frost promoting protein.

Currey's visit was part of what a company spokesman termed a Florida blitz designed to gain Greyhound favorable statewide news coverage in the early days of the strike by its drivers' union. Every news person in northern Florida was there, said Greyhound spokesman George Gravley, whose company dispatched Currey to three Florida cities that day to meet publicly with riders and replacement drivers.

Clearly, it's a David and Goliath thing. The Greyhound drivers simply don't have the resources, Nichols said. Neither side in the bus strike will say what it's spending for public relations advice.

The Greyhound drivers simply don't have the resources, Nichols said. Neither side in the bus strike will say what it's spending for public relations advice. Since March 2, when 6,300 drivers and 3,000 maintenance and other workers walked out, the strike has been marred by vandalism and violence.

Analysts point to the ongoing Eastern Air Lines walkout and last year's Pittston coal strike as recent labor disputes where unions waged successful campaigns to win public support.

Although machinists at Eastern are still on strike, their publicity campaign against Frank Lorenzo, head of the carrier's parent company, made him out to be the Darth Vader of the corporate world in the public's mind, one labor official said.

Blohowiak said companies are more media conscious now than they were 10 years ago because increased competition has prompted consumers to consider a company's attitude toward its workers when making purchasing decisions.

Greyhound's efforts to win public opinion have been persistent. Twice in two weeks, Dallas based Greyhound executives flew to Washington for news conferences to complain about strike related violence. Neither event had a Washington focus, and in fact, the latest one was to announce the filing of a lawsuit in Florida against union officials.

Twice in two weeks, Dallas based Greyhound executives flew to Washington for news conferences to complain about strike related violence. Neither event had a Washington focus, and in fact, the latest one was to announce the filing of a lawsuit in Florida against union officials. Gravley, the Greyhound spokesman, said the event was held in Washington because that's where the national press corps is based.
