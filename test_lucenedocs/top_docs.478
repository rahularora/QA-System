An official from the Los Angeles airport disputed Braniff's charge. The Department of Airports has not denied nor in any way interfered with access to LAX, and Braniff has in fact been operating here since May 1991, said Clifton A. Moore, the airports' executive director. Braniff also said it was financially damaged in recent months by the actions of a lessor, which Braniff said wrongly declared that it had defaulted on a leasing agreement.

WH Smith, the retailing and distribution group, has signed its biggest US airport deal so far, expected to add Dollars 25m to its current annual turnover of Dollars 65m (Pounds 43.3m) from its 93 US airport shops. The company has been awarded a contract to operate eight news and gift shops at Los Angeles International, the world's fourth largest airport. The contract is the largest news and gift concession in a US airport, representing about 40 per cent of all concessionary business at Los Angeles International, Smith beat competition from the existing incumbent, Duty Free Shoppers, and Allders International, the duty and tax free retailer.

Pilots responding to a survey on airport safety rated Los Angeles International the most dangerous in the nation and Dallas Fort Worth International the safest, it was reported Monday. However, many of the pilots said the main factor governing airport safety is people, and that can vary at any facility at any time, according to the survey, conducted by The Atlantic Constitution. The newspaper in February and March polled 2,200 pilots who hold air transportation certificates, asking them to list in no particular order the five safest and least safest airports.

The FAA also will target four airports to test new ground radar technology and study possible changes in how to move planes on the ground perhaps even change ages old flying terminology, the sources said. In addition, the FAA intends to solicit breakthrough technology from the aerospace industry, including such things as computer screen maps of airports for jetliner cockpits. ; The FAA initiative comes as its own records show that near collisions among planes on the ground have increased to 267 in 1990, up almost 50 percent from 179 such collisions in 1988.; So called runway incursions have been relatively infrequent at Los Angeles International, but the incidents have been increasing there, too.

While a Cuban exile awaited a court appearance in the attempted hijack of an American Airlines jet, authorities tried to figure out how he smuggled a starter gun and two knives on the plane. Pedro Rene Comas Benos, an escaped mental patient wearing green military fatigues and a bomber style jacket, was able to elude X ray machines and other security Saturday at Los Angeles International Airport, considered one of the nation's most secure. He boarded Flight 30 in Los Angeles and that's where we should have caught him, Ed Martelle, American Airlines spokesman said Saturday from the company's headquarters in Dallas.

<P> For years Los Angeles city officials have talked about using the huge Palmdale Airport as an extension of Los Angeles International Airport. Since the city is predicting soaring LAX traffic (March 12), now is the time to put that facility to use. There could be an overhead monorail train running from LAX to Palmdale Airport to transport passengers, thus alleviating the traffic congestion and the presumed huge number of passengers expected by the year 2000.

Airports in Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles stepped up security Tuesday following Iran's vows to avenge the deaths of the 290 people in a jetliner shot down by an American warship.

We're sensitive to the Iranian incident and we've taken immediate steps to increase our security posture, Dale Harris, superintendent of operations at Los Angeles International Airport, said Monday.

A United Airlines Boeing 737 jetliner with 107 people was unable to lock its right landing gear and skidded to a safe emergency landing Tuesday, officials said. The jet's right main gear would not lock and the pilot set the plane down at Los Angeles International on the nose gear, left main gear and the engine under the right wing, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Fred O'Donnell. The 102 passengers and five crew members slid down emergency chutes, he said.

James Burnett, the National Transportation Safety Board member who is acting as spokesman for the federal investigation team, said it had found out of service a ground based radar system to assist Los Angeles International Airport control tower personnel in keeping track of traffic. The system, called ASDE for airport surface detection equipment, is one of only a dozen in place at the hundreds of airports around the nation. An examination of records in the tower also showed that even after 11 incidents of operator error in recent years here, including one in which a DC 10 landed over an Airbus in position for takeoff in July, officials hadn't ever filled the assistant controller position they created to help alleviate the problem.

The Federal Aviation Administration has gotten clearance for a pay increase plan designed to attract more experienced air traffic control employees in the nation's three largest metropolitan areas. The Office of Personnel Management approved a demonstration project Thursday calling for the FAA to boost pay by as much as 20 percent for some employees at hard to staff air traffic control centers in the New York, Los Angeles and Chicago areas. The five year experiment will determine whether incentives are an effective tool in recruiting and retaining personnel, Transportation Secretary James Burnley said.

Federal officials say they hope an offer of higher pay will attract and keep air traffic controllers at the nation's busiest towers and control centers. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner announced that 2,100 Federal Aviation Administration controllers, technicians and safety inspectors at 11 facilities in the New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Oakland areas will get pay raises of up to 20 percent. The air traffic controllers in the busiest centers of this country will be some of the highest paid people in the federal government, Skinner said Monday at FAA offices near O'Hare International Airport, the nation's busiest.

Many FAA control rooms have been chronically understaffed since former President Reagan fired some 11,400 air traffic controllers during an illegal strike in August 1981.

The union was certified to represent the nation's 7,000 air traffic controllers in 1987, replacing the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, which was decertified after the 1981 strike.
