Government rather than the chemical industry should track the half a million daily shipments of hazardous materials over the nation's roadways, the chief sponsor of a bill supported by the nation's firefighters said Wednesday. Another congressman said, however, that the relatively low number of fatalities, injuries and property losses may not justify proposals that could cost the chemical and trucking industries hundreds of millions of dollars a year. The House Public Works and Transportation subcommittee on surface transportation is considering changes in the law to increase training requirements for drivers, make regulations more uniform from state to state and keep track of all hazardous cargo with a nationwide computer system.

It gives local police, firefighters and others a number to call for information on hazardous cargo so they will know how to handle various chemicals in an accident. But Applegate said the answering service is useful only when the materials involved are known, and this may be difficult at the site of a crash where chemicals have spilled out and the vehicle is smashed or ablaze.

Harvison, president of the National Tank Truck Carriers, said the tank truck industry supports legislation that would make laws more uniform regarding hazardous materials. Trucks cross thousands of jurisdictional boundaries daily, and carriers cannot tailor the equipment and operational characteristics of each truck and driver to meet the singular requirements of a given community, Harvison said.

United Parcel Service of America Inc., the closely held package delivery company based in Greenwich, Conn., said it was studying the complaint and hadn't decided on a response. Most of the citation, however, dealt with alleged violations of written procedures and guidelines, which are complex and subject to conflicting interpretations, UPS said. The company also was cited for failure to develop an emergency response plan, or to train all workers in how to respond to an emergency involving hazardous materials, and for not supplying a proper respirator for employees handling hazardous materials spills.

The company also was cited for failure to develop an emergency response plan, or to train all workers in how to respond to an emergency involving hazardous materials, and for not supplying a proper respirator for employees handling hazardous materials spills. OSHA said its inspection of the Uniondale facility resulted from a call from the Nassau County police hazardous materials team, after methylene chloride, a suspected carcinogen, spilled from a box bound for delivery in the truck.

Spills of toxic materials on railroads rose by 13 percent in 1988, but highway incidents dropped, a private group reported Wednesday. Citizen Action, citing statistics from the Transportation Department, said there were 1,015 toxic spills on railroads last year, the most since the department started keeping track of such incidents in 1982. An industry representative, however, disputed the significance of many of the spills cited by Citizen Action and accused the group of trying to cloud railroad safety.

There were no deaths linked to the spills, but they caused nine major injuries and 27 minor ones and resulted in $2.4 million in damage, Citizen Action said.

Firefighters nationwide need a better system for notifying them of hazardous materials so they can prevent accidents such as the one that killed six Kansas City, Mo. firemen last year, a House panel was told Wednesday. They had no warning that the fire they were trying to extinguish was a time bomb waiting to take their lives, said Terry Conroy, president of the Kansas City chapter of the International Association of Firefighters.

Oil industry executives also announced that they have renewed the $15,000 a day contract for the Soviet vessel Vaidogubsky, a state of the art oil skimmer that will be on standby near the entrance of Prince William Sound as a backup in case of spills.
