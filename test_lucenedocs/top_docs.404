<P> There was no talk of moral victories in the Cal State Fullerton locker room Saturday night after the Titans' 27 13 loss to Mississippi State. </P> <P> Unlike last week's 38 17 loss to Southeastern Conference power Auburn, a feel good game for the Titans because they played well in the second half and weren't completely embarrassed by the nation's third ranked team, Fullerton found little solace in its second loss to an SEC school in eight days. </P> <P> What made this defeat less palatable than last week's was that, although it wasn't a game they should have won, it was a game they certainly could have won.

The lower Mississippi River region is so poor that one section is called America's Ethiopia, and a federal commission is seeking new ways to help its dying towns and end generations of dependence on welfare. There are counties with more than a quarter of the work force idled, a lack of capital to attract new jobs, and waste of human resources, like teen age mothers with sickly babies and adults who cannot read or write. Unlike a foreign country in need, the region of 214 counties in seven states covered by the study gets neither enough sympathy from Washington nor bailouts from international financiers, says Wilbur Hawkins Jr., executive director of the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission.
