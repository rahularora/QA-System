Researchers have located the gene believed to cause neurofibromatosis, a disorder commonly known as Elephant Man's disease. The discovery is the first to identify the gene of a cancerlike disease, and raises the hope that genes for some other cancers may yet be found. Scientists at the University of Utah Medical Center and Massachusetts General Hospital said they believe an abnormal gene on chromosome 17 produces a wide range of problems associated with neurofibromatosis.

Researchers said they are developing a biological diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease and a new method to determine whether various chemicals might be useful in treating the disease. Both developments involve research on a strange protein, called beta amyloid, that accumulates in the brains of persons with Alzheimer's disease. The protein's role in the disease isn't known but the number of amyloid containing lesions in the brain seem to correlate with the disease's severity.

Neil Kowall, a Massachusetts General Hospital researcher and co author of the latest study with rats, added that those experiments also are tricky, hence may take a while for others to confirm.

A new technique to analyze heartbeats may eventually be used to predict which babies are at most risk for sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, researchers reported. SIDS is a largely mysterious affliction that kills about one in every 500 infants, usually without warning. Earlier research suggests that up to 10% of SIDS babies die from respiratory defects that cause them to stop breathing.

Earlier research suggests that up to 10% of SIDS babies die from respiratory defects that cause them to stop breathing. Other causes, however, are little understood. Using a new method to analyze data from electrocardiograms, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital said they detected subtle abnormalities in nerve impulses controlling heartbeats that may account for some 50% of SIDS cases.

A new test can reveal who will get the lethal, inherited Huntington's disease, but doctors have found no rush of people wanting to learn their fate. Doctors from the New England Huntington's Disease Research Center described their experience with the first 16 months of a testing program in a report in today's New England Journal of Medicine. The newly available test can reveal which people with the illness in their families are likely to carry the Huntington's disease gene themselves.

An insurance company is refusing to pay a $2 million life insurance claim to the survivor of an AIDS victim, saying the victim used someone else's blood to qualify for coverage. Lawyers for Massachusetts General Life Insurance Co. want a federal judge in Fort Lauderdale to throw out the $2 million claim by Anthony C. Fioretti, who died of AIDS on Feb. 28, 1989, in Broward County. Fioretti, 40, tested positive for the HIV virus and was rejected by another insurance company less than a month before virus free blood was used in his application to Massachusetts General, the lawyers say.

Kidney stones, which afflict about 350,000 Americans annually, mainly middle aged men, are painful calcium crystals that often lodge in the kidneys or in the ureters, ducts that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Currently, the stones typically are removed by lithotripters, million dollar machines that focus shock waves from outside the body to pulverize stones. Laser systems costing about $240,000, which break up stones with pulses of laser light conducted through optical fibers, are sometimes used, especially on ureter stones.

Researchers here reported promising results with a new imaging technique for detecting sites of infection and possibly some kinds of cancer. The experimental technique, developed at Massachusetts General Hospital, is easy, fast and cheap, and hence it might benefit tens of thousands of patients annually in the U.S. who get hard to spot pockets of infections, said Robert Rubin, a doctor who helped develop the technique. Such patients include people who have had abdominal surgery, those with joint pain possibly due to infection and people with unexplained fevers suspected to be caused by hidden infections.

An experimental treatment for bladder cancer combining lasers and a drug wiped out tumors in almost half of the patients treated, a joint study by Chinese and U.S. researchers showed. The study, in which 19 patients were treated at a Chinese cancer clinic, was too small to prove that the treatment is better than conventional bladder cancer therapies. But it significantly enhances the credibility of a new approach to fighting cancer, called photodynamic therapy, which is beginning to come of age as an anti cancer weapon.

Dr. Haber's antibody derived attack on blood clots is different from a monoclonal antibody developed by Centocor Inc. and which received considerable publicity a couple of weeks ago. The Centocor monoclonal antibody is designed to prevent blood cells from clumping together to form clots.

The race to develop CD4 as therapy against AIDS has now entered the clinic, with human tests of the protein slated to begin today in the first of 50 patients. The test would be the first to gauge a therapeutic strategy that would employ a genetically engineered drug as a decoy to prevent infection of cells in the immune system by the AIDS virus. The initial test of the protein, manufactured by Genentech Inc., will take place at three centers: San Francisco General Hospital in affiliation with the University of California; New England Deaconess Hospital in affiliation with Harvard University; and the National Cancer Institute, a unit of the National Institutes of Health.

In a study of 203 members of nine families, including 71 who had Von Hippel Lindau disease, the marker was inherited along with the defective gene 90 percent of the time, said James Gusella of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

Democratic presidential front runner Michael Dukakis cut short his California campaign Thursday and canceled his final debate with rival Jesse Jackson to return to Massachusetts and his wife Kitty who faced back surgery Friday morning.

Lyme disease is a potentially serious arthritis like ailment caused by a bacteria borne by certain tiny ticks. Incidence of the disease, identified in 1975, is on the rise, and outbreaks are especially common starting about this time of year. Roughly half of the people bitten by the bacteria bearing tick develop the problem, but detecting it is difficult because of its vague early symptoms, such as fatigue and headaches, and because diagnostic tests are imprecise.

It raises such fundamental issues that it needs to be explored before you can call it right or wrong, said ethicist and physician Dr. John La Puma of Lutheran General Hospital, Park Ridge, Ill.

An Amtrak train from Washinton derailed and slammed into a packed commuter train in Boston's Back Bay station during this morning's rush hour, injuring 186 passengers, 10 of them critically, officials said. The impact threw the trains in the air, and spilled 1,500 gallons of diesel fuel which caught fire in the downtown underground station, said acting city Fire Commissioner John Harrison. The commuter train from Stoughton, south of Boston, was hit by Amtrak's Night Owl from Washington at 8:33 a.m., said Nancy Sterling Gleason, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority.

Nearly half of the patients who had heart bypass operations in three hospitals either should not have had the procedures or could have done without them, a new study says. Eliminating unnecessary coronary bypass operations could lead to reduced health care costs and improved patient care, said the study, published in Friday's edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Only 56 percent of the 386 coronary bypass operations performed in the three randomly chosen hospitals from a Western state in 1979, 1980 and 1982 were justified, meaning the benefits outweighed the risks, the study said.

The chemical defects found by the researchers are related to a substance called choline, which brain cells use to form their surrounding membranes. In an analysis of brain samples from people who had died of Alzheimer's disease, the Boston researchers found that choline levels were 40% to 50% lower than in normal brain tissues. Levels of a related membrane building block, called ethanolamine, were similarly reduced.

Levels of a related membrane building block, called ethanolamine, were similarly reduced. The researchers also found abnormally low levels of membrane molecules based on choline and abnormally high levels of a chemical formed by the breakdown of those molecules. Together, the findings suggest that brain cell membranes decay in people with Alzheimer's disease due to defects in the processing of choline and related molecules, said Richard J.

Moreover, they've known that acetylcholine is especially important in brain areas involved in memory. Thus, said Dr. Wurtman, the memory area neurons have a double need for choline to make both membranes and acetylcholine and hence are likely to be hit especially hard by the choline deficiency his team has found.

The study's tentative amyloid link stems from previous research showing that beta amyloid is formed when a precursor molecule embedded in brain cell membranes breaks down. The latest finding suggests that this breakdown process, which has long baffled scientists, occurs when the deterioration of brain cells' membranes exposes the amyloid precursor to scissor like enzymes that cut it apart and form beta amyloid, said Dr. Wurtman.

In the last several months, the new approach, called stereotactic automated large core biopsy, has been encountered by a small but growing number of women. Proponents say it is faster, cheaper, less painful and less disfiguring than the conventional surgical biopsy that 500,000 American women undergo each year. The patients uniformly say there is a minimum of pain and that they would be willing to undergo it again, which they don't say with surgical biopsy, says Jack Meyer, professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School.

Scientists have found the approximate location of a defective gene that is responsible for a rare inherited, cancer causing disease and that may be a major culprit in kidney cancer. The defective gene located by the scientists causes Von Hippel Lindau, or VHL, disease, a relatively rare disorder whose sufferers develop cancers of different organs, including the brain and kidney. Based on the discovery, researchers hope to develop a diagnostic test for the disease within a year, enabling early treatment that could save lives, says Bernd Seizinger, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital who led an international team that made the discovery.

The discovery, reported in today's issue of the journal Nature, involved the discovery of a genetic marker that shows the approximate location of the defective gene causing VHL disease. The researchers found the marker a piece of DNA that acts as a sign post in the maze of genes by examining genetic material from 203 people in nine families with the disease.

Biogen Inc., Cambridge, Mass., said clinical tests have begun with its version of the experimental AIDS drug CD4, a genetically engineered substance that is the subject of a heated research race. CD4 is found on the surface of certain immune cells that are attacked by the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus. Scientists hope that particles of genetically engineered CD4, when injected into patients, will act as decoys for the virus, preventing it from infecting and killing immune cells.

It would be very attractive indeed to be able to block just disease causing blood cells, rather than risking side effects from experimental drugs that more broadly affect the immune system, he said.

The study is reported in today's issue of the British journal Nature by researchers at Stanford, LaTrobe University in Australia and Cetus Corp. in Emeryville, Calif. An estimated 250,000 Americans have MS, an often disabling condition that can produce weakness, difficulty in coordination, dizziness and loss of balance.

A machine that smashes gallstones using shock waves was used for the first time in the United States, and the patient involved in the landmark treatment said it was a lot more pleasant than surgery. Lyn Hicks, 35, of Carrollton, joined her doctors at a press briefing Thursday at Emory University's Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta, the first in the nation to use a new gallstone lithotripsy technique, according to hospital officials. The treatment, Ms. Hicks said, was virtually painless.

Gallstones are small, hard masses that can form in the gall bladder. The lithotripter uses ultrasound to locate the gallstones and send shock waves into the gall bladder, literally smashing them to sand size fragments, which can then be passed into the intestine and out of the body.
