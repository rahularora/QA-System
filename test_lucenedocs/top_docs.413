Procter &amp; Gamble lost at least $300 million because Kimberly Clark copied the design of its super absorbent diapers, an attorney said Wednesday in final arguments in a federal lawsuit over Pampers and Huggies. Procter &amp; Gamble forecast it would make that much money annually from its super absorbent Pampers, said attorney Allen Gerstein, who was representing the soap, toiletries and disposable diaper giant. But sales were $150 million below projections in each of fiscal years 1986 87 and 1987 88 after Kimberly Clark violated the Pampers patent and introduced super absorbent Huggies, Gerstein told U.S. District Judge Falcon Hawkins.

If all goes as planned, the new diaper, marketed under the name TenderCare, will appeal to parents who worry about the chemical processes used in popular disposable diapers, and Rocky Mountain, which had a loss of $10,000 on revenue of $387,000 in the nine months ended June 30, will be a much larger company. The diaper kingpins, of course, contend their products already suit even the tenderest infant bottoms. And Kimberly Clark and Procter &amp; Gamble, which together control about 80% of the disposable diaper business, say the super absorbent material that turns wetness into gel in Huggies, Pampers and Luvs hasn't been found to cause any significant health problems.

Analysts had considered the suit, filed in 1985, as just another salvo in the continuing diaper wars between the two rival companies, which dominate the $3 billion a year market for disposable diapers.

The case was scheduled to go to trial in October, but an agreement among the companies was reached late Monday that says Procter &amp; Gamble's patents are valid and enforceable, according to Donald P.

But lately, with investors turning back to consumer stocks again, some people have cast a kinder eye on Procter &amp; Gamble. The Cincinnati titan's chairman, Edwin Artzt, is fighting hard to defend the company's diapers and detergents from competitors' assaults, analysts say. With help from new kinds of Pampers diapers, Crest toothpaste pumps and Tide detergent they expect the company to show improved profit some time next year; indeed, after a tough fiscal 1991 they say Procter &amp; Gamble can hardly help looking better next year.

The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Rhone Poulenc Rorer Inc., facing an antitrust challenge to a joint marketing plan, said Thursday they cancelled the agreement to avoid a legal dispute. The plan to cooperate in the over the counter drug market would have given P&amp;G, which makes the Pepto Bismol stomach remedy, exclusive rights to sell Rorer's Maalox antacid. The Justice Department announced a lawsuit Aug. 7 challenging the arrangement on grounds it would reduce competition and raise prices in the stomach remedy market.

Randy Thurman, group president of RPR pharmaceuticals, said the companies were confident the arrangement would survive U.S. Department of Justice legal challenges. However, we weighed the risks of an extended court process to RPR's consumer business, our employees and our customers and, on balance, chose to terminate the agreement, Thurman said in a statement from Rhone Poulenc's headquarters in Fort Washington, Pa. Thurman said failing to close the agreement with P&amp;G could reduce pre tax earnings $30 million because of lost revenue from inventory transfers.

Carl Lehrburger, an Albany, N.Y., consultant who wrote a 1988 study that helped raise public concern about the problems with disposable diapers, says diapers are far from the biggest waste problem. While he supports reusable alternatives to the throwaways, he says, the issue has gotten more attention than it deserves. While disposable diapers may not be an environmental disaster, they present their makers with a public relations nightmare.

Leaders in the disposable diaper industry said Wednesday that cloth competitors and consumer misunderstandings likely accounted for recent survey results indicating strong support for banning their product. It's not a simple issue of environment vs. paper diapers, said Scott Stewart, a spokesman for Procter &amp; Gamble Co. The roughly 16 billion disposable diapers sold every year have become an environmental and health issue as local governments try to deal with mountains of used, bacteria laden dirty diapers and rapidly filling landfills.

P&amp;G has several other best selling products here as well, including Japan's top selling shampoo rinse combination, a compact laundry detergent and, one of the hit products of the last year, Whisper sanitary napkins. According to Walbert, Whisper is so popular because P&amp;G did several years of market research, using test groups, and came up with a product tailored to the needs of Japanese women, such as having a wrapper that makes almost no noise when opened. </P> <P> The result has been that P&amp;G's Japanese sales now exceed $1 billion, and Japan probably will soon replace Germany as the company's largest foreign market.

New York City's consumer affairs department says P&amp;G's advertisement, which appeared in TV Guide, promotes the company's Luvs and Pampers brands as easily compostable, but few consumers actually have access to such composting facilities. The ad shows a pile of soil like material that was once a disposable diaper before the 90 day process began. The ad states that nearly 80% of the diaper is compostable.
