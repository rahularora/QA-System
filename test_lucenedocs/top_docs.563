Working Girl, the holiday season hit about an ambitious secretary's escape from the steno pool, combined with a dark film about aging '60s radicals to lead nominations for the 46th annual Golden Globe awards. The awards are considered important not only for their use in newspaper, television and radio ads but also as indicators of favorites for the Oscars in March. Last year's big Golden Globe winners were The Last Emperor, with four trophies, and Moonstruck and L.A. Law with two statuettes apiece.

Out of this trio of love stories, from very different sources and sensibilities, what seems to have emerged is a woman who mixes the pure lovability of a '50s Marilyn Monroe with contemporary accomplishment and intelligence. She's a strange hybrid, and perhaps her success with today's conservative leaning audiences is that she soothes sensibilities ruffled by the strides of liberation. </P> <P> But you know how potent these images are when you hear, as I did last week, an accomplished, extremely successful and beautiful woman say that she studies these actresses fascinatedly, to see how the girly girls work.

Former Miss America Vanessa Williams said she was surprised by all the publicity the NBC TV movie The Sex Tapes received during filming. The film in which she plays a prostitute surrounded by sadomasochism is really just a detective movie with a kinky background, she says in this week's TV Guide. Well I guess it's a combination of the subject matter and the cast, said Ms. Williams, who lost her Miss America crown in 1984 after nude photos of her were published in Penthouse magazine.

Jodie Foster, who had the thrill and disappointment of an unsuccessful Academy Award nomination 13 years ago, won the best actress Oscar Wednesday night for her portrayal of a rape victim in The Accused. This is such a big deal and my life is so simple, the ebullient 26 year old actress told the Shrine Auditorium audience as she clutched the glistening trophy. There are very few things there is love and work and family and this movie was so special to us because it was all three of those things, she said.
