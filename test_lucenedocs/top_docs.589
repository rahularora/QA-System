A replica of the brigantine Niagra, flying a 15 star American flag and Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's Don't Give Up The Ship banner sailed Lake Erie Wednesday in its first sea trial. The 182 foot, 278 ton Niagara sailed out of its Erie port onto the waters where Perry's nine ship squadron defeated six British ships during the War of 1812. The replica contains 42 pieces of Perry's flagship, mostly metal, but those parts make up just 20 percent of the present day Niagra.

A man who spent 20 years trying to leave Cuba unwittingly deported himself and his family from the United States for what he thought would be a 20 minute excursion to the Canadian side of Niagra Falls.

Democrat Albert Gore Jr. says Michael Dukakis lacks foreign policy experience and simply doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to using nuclear weapons and American military power. Trying to catch up with Dukakis and Jesse Jackson before Tuesday's important New York primary, Gore maintained Wednesday that Dukakis had made a major blunder by discussing in a newspaper interview when he would use nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union. He stood by his criticism in the face of a strong denial by Dukakis.

The Massachusetts governor said he had merely reflected existing American and NATO policy in holding open the option of a nuclear response to a successful Soviet invasion of Western Europe with conventional forces. The Tennesse senator offered broader criticism as well, faulting Dukakis for advocating a ban on flight testing of ballistic missiles and for what he said were remarks supporting the commitment of American troops in the event of Communist invaders in West Germany or South Korea.

Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa comes to the United States holding his head high and his hand out, accepting praise for forging the first non Communist government in the Soviet bloc while seeking money for its survival. We are building an America of the East, but that requires billions of dollars from the West, Walesa said in an interview before leaving Poland for his U.S. visit scheduled to begin Monday. Walesa's trip will provide a chance for President Bush and Congress to endorse in words and dollars the changes that are sweeping the Soviet bloc, and most recently have engulfed East Germany.

Last month, the Syracuse, N.Y. based utility slashed its dividend 42%, to $1.20 a share annually, and took a $755 million write off of nuclear plant costs that regulators won't let it charge ratepayers. Then the utility reported a $569.4 million loss for the first half, compared with profit of $238.3 million a year earlier.

Ms. Warrick also has concerns about Rochester Gas &amp; Electric and Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric, which have a 14% and a 9% stake in Nine Mile 2, respectively. She believes there is a fairly high possibility both will have to trim dividends because of Nine Mile 2 costs. New York State Electric &amp; Gas, which has an 18% stake, also may have to trim dividends if it doesn't get the public service commission to approve its request for a 13% return on equity, Ms. Warrick says.

While the utility's service territory in New York state isn't likely to experience much industrial growth in the next few years, Niagra Mohawk's power production costs are reasonable, largely because of low cost hydropower and nuclear power from Nine Mile 1.

Merchants along the country's northern border are floating on a tide of Canadian dollars, watching sales figures swell at a time when shopping elsewhere in the United States is slumping. Canadians have been traveling by car and bus from as far as 100 miles away this year to snap up goods that sell in the United States for as low as half their cost back home. As a result, stores all along the border that reported record sales last year when retailing nationwide was stagnant say business is even better this Christmas.

Canadian shoppers have made this holiday season jolly for U.S. retailers, but some residents are feeling a lack of goodwill toward fellow shoppers from across the border. Low U.S. prices and a comparatively strong Canadian dollar have caused Canadians to throng grocery stores, liquor marts and factory outlets throughout this border city. The prices check it out, said Manny Hilario, 23, who drove 100 miles from Brampton, Ontario, to shop at the Factory Outlet Mall one recent Saturday.

Visitors to this border town shouldn't be surprised if the cold Canadian beer their host offers them has an imported stamp on it these days. An increasing number of Canadians who live near the U.S. border have taken to buying their favorite brews in the United States, where popular Canadian beers sell for as little as half the price charged back home. The trend is seriously worrying the managers of beer outlets in border towns such as Fort Erie, just across the Niagara River from Buffalo, N.Y.

Democrat Albert Gore Jr. said Wednesday that rival Michael Dukakis showed foreign policy inexperience with an unwise and irresponsible statement that he would reserve the right to respond with nuclear force if the Soviets invaded Western Europe. Gore said Dukakis had erred in saying that he would launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union under ... specific circumstances, but transcripts indicated the governor did not make such a statement. Nonetheless, Gore accused the Massachusetts governor of violating a long held tenet of American foreign policy that presidents and aspirants for that office do not spell out to the Soviets or any other country how the United States would make use of nuclear arsenals in response to agression.

The Niagara served as a station ship in Erie until 1820, when it was scuttled in nearby Misery Bay. The ship was raised by Erie citizens in 1913 and restored for a Great Lakes tour to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Perry's victory.

The charge carries a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. But under federal sentencing guidelines, Ms. Cheng would probably face no more than 14 months in prison when she is sentenced Aug. 8. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, in a report last July, named Ms. Cheng, 41, a resident alien who lives in New York City, as a leader of a ring that charged would be immigrants $23,000 apiece to be smuggled into the United States.

A man who persuaded co workers to take a side trip to Niagara Falls because it was his lifelong wish to visit here collapsed and died after fulfilling his dream, authorities said. Eugene Gergler, 68, of Cincinnati collapsed Friday night in the parking lot on Goat Island, between the American and Horseshoe Falls, and was pronounced dead at a hospital a short time later, said state park police Officer Patrick Moriarty. Gergler and three other electricians had been working in Erie, Pa., earlier Friday when he told them his lifelong dream was to see the falls, Moriarty said.

A daredevil who went over Niagara Falls in a barrel in 1985 tried again Sunday but low water stranded his barrel at the brink of the falls, police said. The barrel carrying Dave Munday, 53, stopped a foot before the brink of the 176 foot Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side of the Niagara River. Police used a crane to fish the daredevil and his barrel out of the river rapids.

A Cuban family stranded in Canada by immigration problems since December will not be allowed to return to their home in Miami while their application for asylum is pending, federal officials said Thursday.

It might have been Italy or a stage set by de Chirico but for the bull's heads in the frieze of the colonnade.

The palace of Charles V is arguably the finest Renaissance palace in Spain, but how odd its rusticated bulk looks.

There is nothing in the world to prepare you for the 'Churrigueresque' sacristy of the Cartuja, or Carthusian monastery, at Granada not least the rest of the monastery complex.
