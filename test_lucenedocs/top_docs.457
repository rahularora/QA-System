A white anti apartheid activist was shot and killed Monday outside his home by an assailant firing from a passing car, police said. Colleagues said they had no doubt that David Webster, 44, was assassinated because of his political activities. Webster, a lecturer in social anthropology at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and a prominent member of several anti apartheid organizations, was a leading opponent of the government's policy of detention without trial and held periodic tea parties for the families of detained black activists.

Thousands of black and white mourners Saturday staged the largest anti apartheid march of the 3 year old state of emergency, chanting through whites only suburbs in a funeral procession for an assassinated white activist. Young blacks gave clenched fist salutes, waved banners and sang in support of the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement as they jogged in unison behind the hearse or perched atop overflowing buses for a six mile journey from a downtown cathedral to a cemetery. David Webster, 44, was killed outside his home Monday by a shotgun blast fired at close range from a passing car.

Members of the country's main guerrilla movement, the African National Congress, are reeling from a string of setbacks, including revelations of a spy in their midst and a crackdown on anti apartheid groups. Three guerrillas face a possible trip to the gallows, one leader was assassinated and a purported informer supposedly photographed secret guerrilla documents and turned them over to the government. Congress leaders acknowledge the setbacks and have acknowledged that South Africa's nearly 2 year old state of emergency has hobbled ANC efforts to undermine white minority rule.

Although it was legalized Feb. 2 as part of de Klerk's peace initiative, the ANC says its guerrilla campaign remains one of its tactics in trying to pressure the government to end white minority domination. On Feb. 16, the ANC said from its headquarters in Zambia that it would send a delegation to South Africa to confer with de Klerk about obstacles in the way of negotiations on a new constitution. The ANC says the state of emergency must be lifted and all political prisoners freed before such talks can start.

The last participant in a hunger strike has resumed eating, ending a protest that helped win freedom for hundreds of black inmates who were held without charge, a human rights group said today. The Human Rights Commission said the last known hunger striker, Zelile Zwane, began eating Thursday after being taken to court and charged with various offenses, including illegal weapons possession and attempted murder. Like the other hunger strikers, many of them anti apartheid activists held since 1986, he had demanded the government either release him or charge him.
