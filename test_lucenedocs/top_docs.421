So far, the growing field of SCID mouse research has been dominated by three groups: Systemix Inc., Palo Alto, Calif., which is 60% controlled by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Sandoz Ltd.; the Medical Biology Institue in La Jolla, Calif.; and the Weizmann Institute of Rehovot, Israel. The Immunex Toronto team discovered that giving the mice a unique combination of growth factors following bone marrow transplant nourished the regrowth of a wide range of red and white blood cells found in the human body. This is an exciting paper, and a major advance in the development of a humanized mouse, said Jerome Groopman, chief of hematology at the New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston.

These might include red cell deficiencies like anemia and thalassemia, as well as the malignant overgrowth of white cells that occurs in leukemia. The key to repopulating these red and white blood cell lineages was treating the mice with one or more human proteins: human mast cell growth factor, or Immunex's new hybrid protein called PIXY321, a combination of interleukin 3 and GM CSF.

Doctors hope to reduce the complications of sickle cell disease by prompting the body to produce a substance that it ordinarily stops making after birth. The experimental treatment involves the drug hydroxyurea, a medicine approved for treating melanoma and some other forms of cancer. Sickle cell victims make defective hemoglobin, the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body.

In the same trial, a new genetically engineered anemia drug called erythropoietin, or EPO, yielded no improvement in sickle cell patients, the researchers said. We are very optimistic about this, said H. Franklin Bunn, director of hematology research at Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital, Boston, and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Treatment until now has been aimed at getting patients out of acute pain crisis and managing symptoms while they are hospitalized, he said.

For many of these, predictive tests are in use; for others, the search for a valid test is continuing.

A National Institutes of Health panel recently recommended that all newborns be screened for sickle cell anemia; early detection and treatment can limit fatal infections. There is more and more activity in state legislatures to require prenatal or newborn screening for more and more disorders, on a cost benefit argument that early detection and treatment can limit future costs, says Ms. Andrews. But many people question whether saving money is valid reason to invade a person's privacy, and contend that benefit cost ratios must be very large to justify mandatory screening without consent.

He said there would be strong medical and commercial benefits in developing a gene therapy for fairly widespread genetic defects, such as sickle cell anemia, which afflicts about 50,000 American blacks.

The finding is especially intriguing, and is expected to be controversial, because the researchers believe the drug worked by neutralizing aluminum that often appears in excess amounts in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. Several scientists, including the Toronto group, have speculated that the aluminum plays a critical role in killing brain cells, although many Alzheimer's researchers dispute that hypothesis. The Toronto researchers tested Desferal because it is a chelating agent, or chemical that draws metals, including aluminum, out of human tissue.

Saturday's meeting marked the first public mention of CNT, which appears as active as AZT in tissue culture, and thus should be another candidate for pre clinical development, Dr. Broder said. A presentation about ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s drug ribaviran prompted a renewal of scientific skepticism about the drug, however.

Several scientists suggested the patients receiving a placebo or sugar pill as a control, who should have been carefully selected to match patients in the drug group, were perhaps sicker at the outset.

Researchers announced Thursday that they had discovered and isolated the gene that causes cystic fibrosis, a landmark finding that could lead to new treatments for the devastating killer of young people. The discovery should help reveal just what goes wrong in the body to cause the disease, which in turn may suggest how to treat the root of the disease rather than just its effects, scientists said. The work will also help permit greatly expanded testing to identify the estimated 12 million Americans who unknowingly carry the gene in a defective form that causes the disease and who could pass it along to offspring, said researcher Lap Chee Tsui.

Researchers have isolated fetal cells from pregnant women's bloodstreams, suggesting it should be possible to diagnose genetic disorders in a fetus simply by taking a blood sample from the mother. If the preliminary finding of fetal cells in mother's bloodstreams is confirmed, it should be possible to do the same kind of genetic tests on those fetal cells as are now done on fetal tissue samples obtained through amniocentesis. That procedure involves the withdrawal of some of the fluid surrounding the fetus.

The technique holds promise of a new way to treat diseases such as heart disease and cancer as well as genetic diseases, said Elizabeth Nabel, Gregory Plautz and Gary Nabel, of the internal medicine department at the Michigan medical school. Gary Nabel, who is Elizabeth Nabel's husband, also is with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute on the Michigan campus. A potential beneficiary of the new technique might, for example, be a heart patient whose clogged coronary arteries have just been reopened by surgery or other techniques.

Researchers experimenting with laboratory rabbits have proved that gene manipulation can be used to correct an inherited disorder that causes high cholesterol levels and early heart attacks. In a study published Thursday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers reported they were able to transfer into rabbit liver cells a gene that temporarily corrected a genetic defect in the liver called familial hypercholesterolimia. This disorder is caused by an abnormal gene that prevents the liver from processing low density lipoprotein cholesterol, the so called bad cholesterol.

The patient's destroyed bone marrow and blood system could then be reconstituted by injections of a few of the patient's own stem cells that had been extracted earlier and stored.

The Epstein Barr virus that causes mononucleosis also may trigger a rare form of anemia that can lead to death, scientists reported Tuesday. The DNA, or genetic code, of the Epstein Barr virus has been found in the bone marrow of patients with aplastic anemia, researchers report in this week's Philadelphia based Annals of Internal Medicine. In patients with that disease, usually young adults, the bone marrow quits functioning and fails to produce enough red blood cells to carry oxygen through the body.

At 12:52 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 14, doctors at the National Institutes of Health began transfusing white blood cells into the tiny arm of a 4 year old girl with a rare inherited ailment. For 28 minutes she played with her doctors and put stickers on their lab coats as she helped them launch a new era in medical treatment. She became the first person to receive gene therapy, a treatment intended to compensate for the genetic defect she was born with by giving her normal copies of the defective genes.

Among the new research avenues opened up by the feat is the possibility that the cultured brain cells can be genetically altered and then transplanted into the brains of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's patients as substitutes for the damaged brain cells seen in these disorders. The Johns Hopkins scientists are now attempting such genetic alterations in the cultured cells, according to Solomon Snyder, who heads the research team. The cultured brain cells also might provide insight into how to get nerve cells in the spinal cord to regenerate, a feat that would be a boon to tens of thousands of people paralyzed by spinal cord injuries.

Scientists say they took a step toward improving bone marrow transplants for people with cancer and radiation sickness by purifying, or isolating, a type of cell crucial to development of blood and immunity in mice. Isolation of the special cell type, called a stem cell, eluded researchers for 30 years until achieved by doctors at Stanford University Medical Center in Northern California and Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia. The research is outlined in Friday's issue of the journal Science.

Rather, it's a back to basics experiment, a technical trial of gene splicing in patients already receiving treatment in an experimental cancer program being conducted by Dr. Rosenberg. The goal is to see if a gene can be inserted into the right cells, stay there and function. In the cancer program, Dr. Rosenberg is testing a form of therapy combining the growth promoter interleukin 2 (IL 2) and cancer fighting, white blood cells called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs.

Scientists at the University of California at Los Angeles reported that the protein GM CSF may boost production of an AIDS virus strain in certain types of cells, calling for caution in its use as a treatment for the fatal syndrome. GM CSF, a blood cell growth factor, is being tested against a number of diseases, including cancer and acquired immune deficiency syndrome, in an effort to combat the suppression of white blood cells by the disease itself or as result of chemotherapy. Lowered white blood cell counts can lead to life threatening infections.

It isn't known how many AIDS patients overall are infected by a similar strain, and thus how many might respond similarly to GM CSF. However, scientists have known for more than two years that the AIDS virus attacks not only T cells white blood cells responsible for immune regulation but also monocyte macrophages.

Currently, synthetic versions of GM CSF are produced by biotechnology companies, including Schering Plough Corp., Immunex Corp. and Genetics Institute Inc. in collaboration with Sandoz Inc. Dr. Groopman yesterday characterized the paper as interesting, but one which needs to be put in perspective.

His clinical data on GM CSF don't support the notion that the agent exacerbates viral production. Secondly, Dr. Groopman said he isn't giving GM CSF to AIDS patients as a single agent any longer, but rather in combination with the antiviral drug AZT; researchers believe the two may be synergistic, with GM CSF countering the bone marrow suppression brought on by AZT therapy.

The injected normal cells, it is hoped, will supply a muscle protein, the lack of which is the cause of the relentless deterioration of the muscles that is the hallmark of muscular dystrophy. It will be several months before the Canadian researchers can determine whether the injected muscle cells will produce the protein and whether the protein will stop or reverse the steady weakening of the surrounding muscle. Effectiveness will be judged by comparing, in each boy, the strength of the biceps in the treated arm with the strength of the biceps in the opposing arm which received only injections of salt water.

For the first time in a large muscle, we've determined that the procedure is feasible as well as safe, neurologist George Karpati of the Montreal Neurological Institute reported on behalf of a team involving scientists from five Canadian medical institutions.

Within a year, the Boston researchers found that the normal version of the defective muscular dystrophy gene produced a protein that they dubbed dystrophin. It was quickly discovered that boys suffering the most common and severest form of the disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, completely lacked dystrophin, while those with a milder form, Becker muscular dystrophy, had defective versions of the protein.

If the transplanted cells take and their dystrophin does in fact stem the destruction of the surrounding bicep muscle, researchers would still have to figure out how to treat the entire patient rather than a single muscle.

If the transplanted cells take and their dystrophin does in fact stem the destruction of the surrounding bicep muscle, researchers would still have to figure out how to treat the entire patient rather than a single muscle. The next phase would be to go on and try to inject multiple muscles, particularly the muscles involved in breathing, walking and arm movements, Dr. Karpati said.
