The family of the man who founded the Wal Mart Stores Inc. discount chain wants to restructure the way they hold company stock, which could result in substantial tax benefits, according to the company's proxy report. The Walton family members now hold 218 million Wal Mart shares, worth about $7.7 billion, as owners of a Delaware corporation called Walton Enterprises that actually holds the stock. The individual Waltons company founder Sam Walton and his four children, S. Robson, John T., Jim C. and Alice L. own roughly equal shares of Walton Enterprises.

But according to Ms. Rabalais, the little company also demonstrated that the concept was financially viable giving Wal Mart the desire to run its own stands at Sam's. Although she gives the company a 10% cut of sales, she concedes Wal Mart probably earns more at the Sam's locations outside Texas, where it operates its own stands. Last year, Sam's ordered Ms. Rabalais's hot dog stands off its Texas lots, then reversed its position after the media publicized the implications of that order for the 92 elderly and handicapped employees of Hot Diggity Dogs.

Wal Mart Stores is one of the tallest trees left standing since the market hurricane toppled many others like Limited and Gap, which had been growing to the sky. Limited and Gap have fallen 65% and 75% from their 1987 peaks, and both sell at discounts to the price earnings ratio of 14 times estimated 1987 earnings for the 500 stocks in Standard &amp; Poor's index. Wal Mart, down only 42%, still sells at a fat premium of 23 times earnings, as a result of its track record for growth and its status as a heartland discounter of blue collar goods.

Forty years later, Bentonville is still the headquarters for more than 1,700 Wal Mart stores, about 208 Sam's Warehouse Clubs and four hypermarkets. These are served by 20 distribution centres, employ 365,000 people, and capital expenditure runs at more than Dollars 2bn a year. Mr Walton, now 73, and his four children ranked third last year in Fortune's list of the 500 richest Americans.
