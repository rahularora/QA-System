<P> See No Evil, Hear No Evil (citywide) is an apt title for this brisk, ingenious and funny comedy that happily reunites Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder. Pryor's Wally is blind, and he is as proudly stubborn about acknowledging his disability as Wilder's Dave is about admitting that he is totally deaf. They skirmish mightily upon meeting each other, but Dave recognizes enough of himself in Wally to hire him as an assistant at his Manhattan lobby newsstand.

<P> The posters promoting Paramount Pictures' Funny About Love show Gene Wilder in a wacky pose with an alarm clock and baby perched on top of his red blond Brillo hair. The image is typical of how audiences have come to perceive the actor, best known for an endearingly guileless slapstick schtick that has defined his on screen persona from 1968's The Producers through his last film, 1989's See No Evil, Hear No Evil. </P> <P> However, those actually seeing the movie, which opened Friday, will find a far different Wilder than they have encountered before.

Actor Martin Sheen replaced actress Ali MacGraw as honorary mayor of this seaside community and made Malibu's 27 mile coast off limits to nukes. I hereby declare Malibu a nuclear free zone, a sanctuary for aliens and the homeless and a protected environment for all life, wild and tame, Sheen said in a statement issued after the Chamber of Commerce appointed him to his honorary post last week. Sheen has been active in anti nuclear demonstrations and grape boycotts, but he said the biggest lure of his new job was strictly non political.

Daily Variety's Art Murphy calculates the 1990 summer is only 6 percent short of last year's sizzler, which amassed a record $719 million.

Jan Svankmajer's Faust treads the city of Prague like a lost tourist in Kafkaland. The film begins with live action, as our clerkish, woebegone hero (Petr Cepek) threads the city's alleys and labyrinths as if they were the mazes of his own minds. Then on dance menacing puppets, the writhing clay creatures, the bald, hog toothed Mephistopheles and the giant wooden mask that disgorges mini marionettes like Gulliver throwing up Lilliputians.

Much of Faust is appallingly funny; most of it is inspirationally surreal; and some of it is a touch laborious, as we would expect when a short film genius goes to feature length. Wit and vision, though, are rare enough in the movie world: we are not about to send them back even when they are thinly spread.
