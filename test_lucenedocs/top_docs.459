When he announced his family's plans to sell Rockefeller Center, David Rockefeller said the deal preserves the abiding commitment to New York City his father made 50 years ago, and which generations of the family continue to feel. But the sale to one of Japan's largest real estate companies underscored a change in the relationship between the Rockefellers and New York, and offered a reminder that the city will have to face the next century with relatively little assistance from a family that helped it through this one. New York has had many rich and powerful families such as the deLanceys, the Astors and the Vanderbilts, but none shaped the city like the Rockefellers.

The Supreme Court has agreed to resolve a dispute that could put at risk the federal protection for the pensions of 30 million U.S. workers. The justices said Monday they will decide what authority the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a federal agency, has to order employers to revive scraped pension plans. A federal appeals court limited such authority by setting aside the agency's order that LTV Corp. and a subsidiary, LTV Steel Co., restore three pension plans with unfunded liabilities of $2.3 billion.

The pilots agreed to fly the planes beginning Sept. 18, ending a dispute over the size of the cockpit crew that had kept the planes grounded since June.

Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says he doesn't want the power over airline takeovers that a bill pending in Congress would give him. The House planned today to take up the Air Carrier Securities Act, which would require the Transportation Department to block purchase of 15 percent or more of an airline if the sale threatened to hinder safety, reduce competition, break up the carrier or put it under foreign control. Skinner made the comment Monday in an interview.

Mitsubishi Estate Co. is going to buy a controlling interest in the company that owns Rockefeller Center for $846 million, and it is the latest in a series of major Japanese real estate purchases in this country. But the original 12 building portion of Rockefeller Center, including Radio City, may not be controlled by Mitsubishi past the year 2000, when public sareholders of a real estate investment trust could take control.

The United States meanwhile attracted $21.7 billion in direct investment from Japan, up 47.6 percent from fiscal 1987. Federal Express, Merck Pharmaceuticals, Motorola, Bayer and General Electric Co. are among many foreign companies that have made small inroads. Pickens' stake in Koito and Polly Peck's takeover of the ailing Sansui Electric Co. indicate traditional barriers to foreigners are crumbling, says Howard Chao, an attorney with the Tokyo office of O'Melveny and Myers.

Buying 51% of Rockefeller Group Inc. is right up Mitsubishi Estate Co.'s alley in one sense: The huge Japanese real estate company is entering a long term relationship with a similarly conservative U.S. owner of tony urban property.

Attica Correctional Facility inmates have no claim against Nelson Rockefeller's estate for deaths that occurred during a violent prison uprising in 1971, a federal judge has ruled. A former state corrections commissioner, former state police officials and New York National Guard officials remain defendants in the $2 billion lawsuit. Although Rockefeller, then governor, gave state police the go ahead to retake the prison from rebelling inmates on Sept. 13, 1971, he can't be held legally responsible for the 39 deaths that resulted, U.S. District Judge John Elfvin said Friday.
