Scientists spent Tuesday installing new seismic devices on the flanks of Redoubt Volcano and repairing a monitor damaged in an eruption last week. Schools were closed because of an eruption Monday. The mountain remained active, but there were no significant eruptions ollowing Monday's blasts, which pushed ash and steam eight miles into the air.

Schools were closed because of an eruption Monday. The mountain remained active, but there were no significant eruptions ollowing Monday's blasts, which pushed ash and steam eight miles into the air. The ash plume turned daylight to darkness and blanketed parts of the nearby Kenai Peninsula with up to three quarters of an inch of ash.

Mount St. Helens is approaching a landmark of sorts: two full years without any new blasts of smoke and ash, or even burps of lava. The last eruptive episode occurred Oct. 21 24, 1986, when the southwest Washington volcano added a new lobe to the top of the lava dome that sits in its gaping crater. The dome remains dwarfed by the cavernous crater, even though it has built to a height of 875 feet above the crater floor.

Ten years after its massive eruption, there is a 50 50 chance Mount St. Helens will explode its dome again within three decades, a University of Washington seismologist says. Steve Malone, a geophysics professor on a team monitoring the Pacific Northwest, said Thursday that Mount St. Helens is the most likely volcano in the Cascade Mountains to erupt in the next 20 to 30 years. Our capabilities for monitoring volcanoes have improved since Mount St. Helens erupted, he said.

Steve Malone, a geophysics professor on a team monitoring the Pacific Northwest, said Thursday that Mount St. Helens is the most likely volcano in the Cascade Mountains to erupt in the next 20 to 30 years. Our capabilities for monitoring volcanoes have improved since Mount St. Helens erupted, he said. Malone said seismic activity, which the predication is largely based on, is a good barometer of eruptive potential because it indicates the breaking of rock below the earth's surface as molten material rises underneath the volcano.

Mount St. Helens belched volcanic ash that settled over a south central Washington community Saturday, while seismic equipment detected a small explosion in Alaska's Redoubt Volcano that prompted flight restrictions. The National Weather Service reported a light dusting of ash south of Yakima, Wash., in the Toppenish area about 80 miles east of Mount St. Helens. It was gritty and it was still falling out of the sky, said David Foster of Toppenish, who found his two cars coated with dust when he awoke Saturday morning.

Mount St. Helens trembled after its biggest outburst in four years, and Alaska's Redoubt Volcano shot steam and ash in its largest eruption since it reawakened a month ago, forcing schools to close today.

Scientists took samples of gritty ash from the flanks of Mount St. Helens in hopes of learning whether the volcano's latest burst will bring more explosive activity. Three scientists got within 12 miles of the crater on the east flanks of the 8,366 foot mountain Sunday to gather ash from the largest explosion in nearly four years. Dan Dzurisin, acting scientist in charge of the Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, said the ash appeared to be pulverized material from previously erupted lava.

The southwest Washington volcano killed 57 people and turned verdant forests into an eerie lunar style landscape in its May 18, 1980, eruption. And there is a high probability of another major blast within the next 50 or 60 years, said geologist Dwight Crandell. That eruption could have six times the force of the 1980 blast, which had the power of a 24 megaton nuclear warhead or 2,500 Hiroshima bombs, he said.

The National Academy of Science and United Nations previously have endorsed an international scientific effort for the 1990s designated the International Decade for Natural Hazards Reduction. To reduce volcano deaths, scientists must identify high risk mountains, study their geology to learn how often eruptions occur and whether the eruptions were explosive, map the routes of killer flows to identify danger zones, then install monitoring equipment where necessary to listen for earthquakes, uplift and tilting, and other signs of activity. Asked who should pay the bill for better volcano monitoring, Tilling replied: There's the question.

A family living in the shadow of reawakened Redoubt Volcano was airlifted to safer ground, and scientists warned that the mountain could go on launching ash and steam for some time. The continent's most notorious volcano, Mount St. Helens in Washington state, also showed signs of life after more than three years of silence. In Alaska, the rescue came on the fourth day of intermittent ash and steam eruptions from the mountain, which lies in a sparsely populated region 115 miles southwest of Anchorage.

But it still has the power to disrupt commerce and everyday life. Redoubt's threat forced the closure Tuesday of the Drift River oil storage terminal, 20 miles from the volcano, and much of the Cook Inlet offshore oil field that the facility serves. The terminal, with 38 million gallons of oil in its tanks, sits near the Drift River, which has overflowed with water from snow and glaciers melted by Redoubt's internal heat.

A swarm of microearthquakes and discovery of a possible underground pool of molten rock provide hints that California's dormant Medicine Lake Volcano might be reawakening, scientists said Friday. However, there is no evidence an eruption is likely, U.S. Geological Survey scientists said. It's suspicious enough to put in a new network (of seismic monitors) but not suspicious enough to cause alarm, said John R. Evans, a seismologist at the agency's western regional headquarters.

Each island beginning with Kauai and Niihau and followed by Oahu, Molokai, Lanai and Maui and Hawaii were active volcanoes at one time. A large portion of Hawaii Island, the youngest in the chain, currently sits over the hot spot. It is the island's location that presently accounts for the volcanic activity at Kilauea, which has been in continuous eruption since 1983.

As the Juan de Fuca plate is pushed deeper into the earth, the friction melts the rock to form highly pressurized magma that can be released with explosive force, Okamura said.

On the naval base itself, a hail of sand smashed more than 200 structures, including dozens of warehouses and workshops vital to the base's primary mission of repairing and resupplying U.S. Navy vessels. The volcanic fallout also shredded 37,000 acres of triple canopy jungle, the last large stand of virgin forest in Luzon. Protected from the illegal logging that has deforested most of the rest of the island, the Subic jungle provided the base with a vital watershed and a unique venue for jungle survival courses taught by aboriginal Aetas, a Negrito people descended from some of the earliest inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago.

Molten rock moving beneath California's Mammoth Mountain ski resort triggered thousands of small earthquakes since May, but the U.S. Geological Survey says the old volcano is unlikely to erupt. We still see occasional bursts of quake activity, but it's much more sporadic in recent weeks than in June, when hundreds of tiny jolts each day rattled the 11,053 foot mountain in the Sierra Nevada, said USGS geophysicist Dave Hill, the scientist in charge of monitoring the situation. In a statement issued Monday, the federal agency said: While eruptive activity as a consequence of this current earthquake swarm cannot be ruled out, observations at many volcanoes in the world suggest the most likely outcome ... is a return to an extended period of relative quiescence.
