Sony is thinking small in a big way about video. A decade after its Betamax home video format lost out to rival VHS, Sony Corp. of America, a unit of the Japanese consumer electronics giant, is trying to force its way back into the video limelight with its 8mm format, launched four years ago. Sony hopes to popularize Video 8 through the concept of personal video video wherever you go as exemplified by its Video Walkman line: tiny battery operated color mini TVs with built in videocassette recorders.

Sony Corp. said today it will begin marketing VHS format video cassette recorders in the United States this fall. A Sony official said the electronics giant began marketing VHS format VCRs in Europe in May and will begin selling them in Japan July 21. Sony has produced and marketed only Beta format VCRs in the past, and the official said Sony will continue to market Beta format VCRs at home and abroad in fiscal 1988, which ends next March 31.

Super VHS, introduced in 1987, uses special tapes and circuitry to provide higher quality pictures than normal VHS. Currently, VHS machines record video and FM audio signals on two different layers of the videotape's magnetic coating in a technique called depth multiplexing. The digital sound information will be recorded on the same layer as the FM signal, JVC said.

A costly battle over the design of the next generation of video cassette recorders has been averted by an agreement on technical standards between the world's leading consumer electronics companies. The accord, reached in Tokyo yesterday by the 50 members of the HD Digital VCR Conference, is expected to head off a standards war of the kind that marred the introduction of analogue video recorders. Sony had led the way with its Betamax format, but eventually had to concede defeat to JVC, which was more successful in persuading video film suppliers to use its VHS standard.

The companies didn't say when such products might become available. High definition television sets which offer crisper pictures and sound than today's standard televisions are already on sale in Japan, and regular commercial broadcasting is expected to begin later this year. The agreement is ironic because Sony and Matsushita have been major protagonists in a bitter decade long battle for the shape of commercial video technology.

Matsushita endorsed VHS prevailed over Sony's Betamax in the first generation of home video machines.

The world's biggest consumer electronics companies are bracing for battle. The prize is the lucrative market for the next generation of portable music players. For the protagonists, Sony on the one side, Philips and Matsushita on the other, victory could determine whether they consolidate, or slip from, their positions at the top of the industry during the 1990s.

Other members of the HD Digital VCR Conference include Matsushita and Toshiba of Japan, Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France. The computer companies IBM and Apple of the US are members because digital VCRs can be used to store computer data.

JAPANESE consumer electronics companies, led by Matsushita and Sony, are in talks aimed at agreeing a common standard for the next generation of video tape recorders, digital VTRs, which record films from televisions or camcorders in computer language. Unlike the current generation of analogue VTRs, in which picture quality falls off sharply when copies are made, digital VTRs offer the prospect of virtually perfect pictures no matter how many copies are made. The discussions, which involve two of the fiercest rivals in the consumer electronics industry, represents a concerted effort by Japanese manufacturers to prevent a damaging standards war in an area which they believe will be important in stimulating consumer demand for new electronics products.

Matsushita, as well as Sony, has invested heavily in the digital audio tape technology, but now we think DAT is for high end professional audio, while digital compact cassettes are for consumer use, the Matsushita spokesman said. Digital compact cassette players can play regular cassettes, while DAT players cannot. The key characteristic of all three technologies Philips's digital compact cassette, Sony's Mini Disc, and DAT is that they record and play sound digitally, which is a clearer, more efficient method than the analog format used on conventional tapes.

When the Consumer Electronics Show opens tomorrow in Las Vegas, Nev., the spotlight will no doubt shine on pricey new versions of such products as stereo television sets and portable compact disk players, which manufacturers hope will bring them big sales this year. But the real winner in the wake of the four day show, which is expected to attract 100,000 dealers, manufacturers and distributors, could be the consumer. Amid frenetic competition among manufacturers and the swelling ranks of retailers, items with some of the latest bells and whistles are likely to become more affordable.

Two products aimed at breaking through consumer resistance to high definition television for home use were unveiled by Victor Co of Japan (JVC) last week. The company plans to launch a low priced HDTV set and HDTV compatible video cassette recorder in the Japanese domestic market by autumn this year. Huge investment in research and development of HDTV by Japanese companies, and the increasing volume of HDTV broadcasting in Japan, have so far translated into very limited sales of HDTV sets, largely due to the prohibitively high cost of models already on the market.

The cheapest HDTV set so far on sale in Japan is a Y1.3m (Pounds 6,800) model from Sony. Other versions, labelled 'Hi Vision', are half way houses between HDTV and conventional TV, using simplified decoders which produce picture quality better than ordinary TVs but not up to full HDTV standards. JVC says production costs for its new HDTV will be much lower because of the development of a smaller, simpler but fully functional decoder requiring fewer integrated circuits.

Two products aimed at breaking through consumer resistance to high definition television for home use were unveiled by Victor Co of Japan (JVC) last week. The company plans to launch a low priced HDTV set and HDTV compatible video cassette recorder in the Japanese domestic market by autumn this year. Huge investment in research and development of HDTV by Japanese companies, and the increasing volume of HDTV broadcasting in Japan, have so far translated into very limited sales of HDTV sets, largely due to the prohibitively high cost of models already on the market.

SONY of Japan's shareholders will not be the only group waiting for signs of an upturn when it reports its first quarter results today, after plunging into a Y20.5bn (Dollars 163m) parent operating loss in the year to last March. Keen interest in Sony's fortunes will also be shown by a batch of Japanese electronics companies, which specialise in the consumer audio visual sector and which look to Sony to set a lead in technological innovation. They will be seeking indications that Sony has products or applications on the horizon which will aid their recovery from the country's protracted downturn in consumer spending.

Sony and Philips, two of the world's largest consumer electronics groups, yesterday fired the opening salvo in the battle to specify the format for the next generation of compact discs, which will play films as well as music. The electronics industry has for years been developing a more sophisticated version of the audio CD, which would replace the video cassette and provide some of the data storage capacity of interactive CD ROM discs. The new discs will be played on special machines, which will also play audio CDs.

Sony and Philips, two of the world's largest consumer electronics groups, yesterday fired the opening salvo in the battle to specify the format for the next generation of compact discs, which will play films as well as music. The electronics industry has for years been developing a more sophisticated version of the audio CD, which would replace the video cassette and provide some of the data storage capacity of interactive CD ROM discs. The new discs will be played on special machines, which will also play audio CDs.
