The sweetly malicious smile on the face of the angel on the facade of Reims Cathedral is the second most famous artistic grin in France. It is second, of course, only to that on the Mona Lisa. But whereas Leonardo da Vinci's smug lady behind her protective glass panel is safe from everything bar nuclear war, the smile on the angel could one day be nothing more than a postcard souvenir.

That anxiety and fear you feel when the dentist says open up, or a police officer behind you turns on his red light, triggers a reaction in the brain that has been measured for the first time by scientists at Washington University in Saint Louis. The researchers tricked eight volunteers into a fearful anticipation of pain from an electrical shock and then measured the blood flow in their brains. The results for the first time established the specific location of an emotion in the brain.

MR Jean Marie Le Pen, leader of the far right French National Front, yesterday stepped up his call for his countrymen to mobilise against the 'felons' in their government who had committed 'treason' by signing the Maastricht treaty on European union, writes David Buchan in Reims. In the heart of the champagne country he held his rally against the historic backdrop of Reims cathedral, site of the baptism of Clovis, King of the Franks, in the 5th century and of the coronation of subsequent French kings. The archbishop cancelled Sunday morning services to keep the Front out of the cathedral itself.

The archbishop cancelled Sunday morning services to keep the Front out of the cathedral itself. Hammering home calls for 'judgment and punishment' in the September 20 referendum, Mr Le Pen suggested that he and others in the No camp would have handled President Francois Mitterrand far more toughly in last Thursday's TV debate than the lacklustre neo Gaullist, Mr Philippe Seguin.

Judging by the Reims crowd, Mr Le Pen is not succeeding in using Maastricht to recruit many anti EC rejectionists from other parties, which all have their own No candidates.

Eight of the refugees were hospitalized with what the Red Cross said were unspecified benign ailments. Most of the rest of the 544 Albanians who arrived in Marseille Sunday were sent on special trains to Reims, on the way to three reception centers outside Paris.

Less than three thousand conscripts serve in the Estonian Defence Forces, the rest being professionals, volunteers, etc. Only Estonian citizens that have become 19 years old can be conscribed to military service.

Only Estonian citizens that have become 19 years old can be conscribed to military service. Reiman said that a major problem is constituted by men who have Estonian citizenship, but whose knowledge of Estonian is poor or who do not speak Estonian at all. He added that these people amounted to 10 15 per cent of the defence forces, the largest number of them in Viru and Kalevi battalions that are located at the north eastern predominantly Russian speaking region.

He added that these people amounted to 10 15 per cent of the defence forces, the largest number of them in Viru and Kalevi battalions that are located at the north eastern predominantly Russian speaking region. Head of the Kalev battalion Alar Laneman admitted that Russians were mostly good soldiers and the authorities have tried to distribute them to the units so that they would be forced to speak Estonian to learn the language.

At present, cards offering fax/modem and local area network capabilities are under development, but as Mr Reimer says, 'developers are limited only by their imagination in what they can now produce with PCMCIA technology.

Although the aircraft was found and the crew list confirmed after several research missions to Papua, New Guinea, in 1986 and 1987, relatives of six of the eight crewmen haven't been found, said Shari Lawrence, spokeswoman for the U.S. Total Army Personnel Command.

The United States will suffer a sharp loss of influence in Europe if Americans withdraw their troops, West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg says. In the past, American cooperation and influence on European policy was helpful, and in future, American policy and influence in Europe can be helpful, Stoltenberg said Tuesday evening. But without any soldiers or significant (numbers of) soldiers, your influence in all matters of security policy will sharply decline, he added.

The Army is looking for the next of kin for six crewmen who died when their B 17 was lost on a 1942 patrol over the Coral Sea, officials say. Although the aircraft was found and the crew list confirmed after several research missions to Papua New Guinea in 1986 and 1987, relatives of six of the eight crewmen haven't been found, Shari Lawrence, spokeswoman for the U.S. Total Army Personnel Command, said Tuesday. The plane disappeared after leaving from Townsville in Queensland, Australia.

Premier Jacques Chirac, long mired in third place in opinion polls, has seen his presidential campaign take off, giving him an edge over rival conservative Raymond Barre with two months left before the vote. The first round of the election, April 24, has become in effect a primary election between Chirac and Barre. Unless there is a stunning turnaround, one of the two will oppose a Socialist, probably incumbent President Francois Mitterrand, in the decisive May 8 runoff for a seven year term.

The main event of Chirac's five hour visit to Reims was a campaign rally that drew 7,000 supporters to a new exposition hall in the suburbs. Many arrived in buses chartered by Chirac's party, the Rally for the Republic, France's most efficient political machine. Rather than give a speech, Chirac answered questions from three men and two women chosen to raise issues of concern in the region.

The first question asked of Chirac, who is juggling duties as mayor of Paris, premier of France and member of a regional council in south central France, was how he can do all the work.

The first question asked of Chirac, who is juggling duties as mayor of Paris, premier of France and member of a regional council in south central France, was how he can do all the work. I'm an optimist by nature, he replied, which probably gives me more energy to face problems.
