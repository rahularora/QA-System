Honda Motor Co. said it will boost engine production capacity sixfold and start making transmissions, suspension assemblies and brakes in the U.S., making it the first Japanese auto maker to build all of the major parts for its cars in the U.S. While Honda already assembles cars in the U.S., it imports most of the parts from Japan. The new operations, which will be part of a $450 million expansion of Honda's Anna, Ohio, engine plant, are the broadest U.S. manufacturing expansion to date by any Japanese auto maker.

The chairman and chief executive officer of Harley Davidson Inc., the Milwaukee based motorcycle maker, said his company doesn't need the final year of a five year tariff aimed at big Japanese motorcycles, and he asked the International Trade Commission to cancel it. The move brought immediate praise from Congress and gave a boost to controversial efforts to aid other battered domestic industries with trade legislation.
