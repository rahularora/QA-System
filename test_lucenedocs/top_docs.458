The Southeast prepared for the worst as Hurricane Hugo took aim at a 300 mile stretch of Atlantic coast that hasn't been hit by such a major storm in a century. With wind speeds rising to 135 miles an hour yesterday evening, Hugo posed a serious threat to coastal residents and property. More than 100,000 people were evacuated from low lying areas under orders from state officials, but they left behind numerous high rise hotels, million dollar beachfront properties and two of the South's most historic antebellum cities, Charleston, S.C., and Savannah, Ga.

Army engineers on bulldozers began rebuilding sand dunes Thursday along South Carolina's hurricane ravaged coast, preparing for abnormally high tides later this month. About 550 soldiers and Marines hauled sand in 100 dump trucks to build up eight miles of dunes between Myrtle Beach and Pawleys Island, where the high tides arriving Oct. 14 pose the greatest threat of erosion, said Corps of Engineers spokeswoman Carol Todd. The moon's closest approach to Earth in years will push tides at least 2 feet above the normal 5 foot range, and northeasterly winds could push them even higher.

It strengthened more than we thought it would, Sheets said, adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding as it moved up the Appalachians. The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm's tidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a normal 5 foot high tide that peaks after 2 a.m. On top of that will be waves, Sheets said earlier, and in many places on barrier islands the buildings will be swept clean off.

On the Isle of Palms, which hosts the U.S. Clay Court Tennis Championships, the hurricane ripped the fishing pier out of the water and destroyed million dollar waterfront homes. About 100 boats that had been docked at the Wild Dunes Marina were stacked up like cordwood across the marina on Goat Island, said Ben Moise, a state Wildlife and Marine Resources Department official. Hugo created a 100 to 200 foot wide channel of water through Pawleys Island, midway between Charleston and Myrtle Beach, according to Jack Sellers, a pilot from Columbia who flew people to the coast to check their property.

Hurricane Hugo lost some of its fury as it roared northward Friday, fading to a tropical storm and then dwindling to an unnamed storm that nevertheless brought heavy rain and the threat of flooding from Tennessee to New York. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches were possible in the storm's path, and forecasters warned that isolated tornadoes were possible from Virginia to Pennsylvania. The storm produced 6 inches of rain at Savannah, Ga., in 24 hours.

We came, we fought, we are victorious, Nabiel Shawa, administrator of this town of 1,500, said after surveyors measured a sand castle built during the weekend. The castle, which included dragons and Teen age Mutant Ninja Turtles, measured 34,503 feet, or 6.53 miles enough for Long Beach to retain title to the world's longest sand sculpture. A continent away, Myrtle Beach officials conceded that the sand castle its residents had created was only 26,834 feet, or 5.1 miles.

In homes already hit by Hugo's blustery winds, rainwater compounded matters by seeping through damaged roofs in this 300 year old city. There's a greater chance of problems with hot wires because of the standing water, said Brian Duncan, a spokesman for South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co.

Early warnings about Hugo last September allowed 350,000 people to evacuate safely, and in South Carolina the worst of the hurricane struck the Francis Marion National Forest between Charleston and Myrtle Beach, Sheets said. It heavily damaged the fishing village of McClellanville and several small rural communities, but the population there is sparse. If Hugo had struck a major coastal population center, the destruction would have been greater than most Americans have ever seen, according to computer simulations known as SLOSH models, for Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes.

With SLOSH, forecasters can predict the height of the storm surge the mass of water piled up by the storm that is a hurricane's most destructive component anywhere along the U.S. coast by punching in a storm's speed, size and intensity, Sheets said.

Army engineers raised a bridge dangling at a 45 degree angle in the water today in an effort to restore the link to two islands cut off from the South Carolina mainland by Hurricane Hugo 13 days ago. High tide this morning helped lift the 500,000 ton bridge, and workers used a crane to restore it to its stand. Officials said they hoped to have the ends of the Ben Sawyer Bridge connected to the road later in the day so that it could be inspected and reopened to traffic Thursday to hurricane devastated Sullivan's Island and the Isle of Palms.

Now we don't have anybody at all during the day, and only an occasional person at night, when it's supposed to be the most crowded.

The clock on St. Michael's Episcopal Church is still missing its gold hands mute testimony to the 135 mph winds of Hurricane Hugo that passed this way six months ago. But just as yellow green leaves have sprouted on trees stripped bare by leviathan winds, South Carolina is mending after the worst storm to batter its coast in centuries. Hugo smashed ashore at Charleston on Sept. 21, killing 29 people, leaving thousands temporarily homeless and thousands more without electricity for weeks.

I've strived to maintain some normalcy in my life, some groundedness Gish said. If I had have moved out to L.A., which there were pressures to do, and started working right away and given up on my education, it would have been so easy for me to be corrupted or eaten by the sharks. My parents are like my support system.
