'Bill Clinton has shown himself to be a person who's culturally aware and concerned, and I expect that his administration will bring new thinking about the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).

His Little Rock idyll was ruined both by what he has come to call a young man's mistakes and the rioting of Cuban refugees at Fort Chaffee, which occurred during his tenure. He was young and he was convinced of what was right and he wanted to get it done immediately, says Webster Hubbell, a former Arkansas Supreme Court chief justice who is one of Mr. Clinton's closest friends.

Re your Aug. 17 second front page article Benefit of B.A. Is Greater Than Ever : The difference in median incomes between college graduates and high school graduates is ascribable to several factors in addition to the knowledge obtained in college and the prestige associated with a college degree.

Thus, even if there were no economic value to a college education and degree, income differentials between the two groups could increase due either to 1) the increased value of motivation in the face of fewer clerical jobs relative to jobs requiring technical skills or 2) college students becoming more money oriented relative to those who did not choose to attend college.

THE 'HILLARY factor' and the role of Mrs Hillary Clinton, the wife of Arkansas governor Bill Clinton, is emerging as a strong force in the Democratic presidential primary campaign and a possible Clinton presidency. As a full partner in her husband's campaign and a prominent lawyer in her own right, Mrs Clinton, at 44, is as much a symbol of generational change in national US politics as her husband. At first viewed as the 45 year old governor's secret weapon, she played a leading role in the nuts and bolts of what has been a well organised campaign.

But this same Reagan had a truly legendary capacity to snooze through Cabinet sessions and limit his working day to four or, at most, five hours of normal presidential activity, devoting the rest of his time to pleasant pursuits such as riding or talking with his wife Nancy. But Reagan had a surprising ability he was excellent at delegating.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton called leaders of both parties to the White House yesterday, for a final discussion on healthcare reform before he unveiled his proposals in a speech to both houses of Congress last night. Both Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary, who has headed the White House healthcare task force, have spent the last week expressing readiness to compromise on virtually all aspects of their proposal. And despite months of planning, many details of the programme, particularly how it will be paid for, have still not been determined.

This will beat by a symbolic one day President Ronald Reagan's initial state of the union message in 1981. Far more than last week's more spiritual inaugural address, it will encompass legislative priorities at home and external foreign policy objectives, though the fine print of Mr Clinton's extensive list of domestic proposals is unlikely to be ready before mid March.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday unveiled a pilot scheme he hopes to develop into a far reaching national service programme with the impact of the GI bill in the 1950s or the Peace Corps in the 1960s. Mr Clinton asked Congress to act quickly on a summer initiative designed to create a core group of about 1,000 leaders to spur community service programmes around the country. The pilot programme is intended to develop into a broader scheme to provide loans for university education, to be paid off by community service, which the president hopes will involve 100,000 people by 1997.

Unlike the budgetary process in the House of Representatives, where he lobbied hard and personally, he allowed the senators to work it out for themselves. Predictably they agreed to drop his broad British thermal unit based energy tax, already narrowly passed by the House in favour of a 4.3 cent a gallon levy on petrol, diesel and most other forms of fuel used in transportation.

President Bill Clinton began a campaign style swing through New Hampshire yesterday, vowing to keep his eye on domestic policies despite attacks from 'people who are giving me hell in Washington.

Congress yesterday took its first tentative step towards putting together a healthcare reform bill when a House of Representatives panel sat down to try to draft legislation. The subcommittee, a healthcare panel of the influential Ways and Means Committee, is chaired by Congressman Pete Stark of California, whose own proposal for reform is somewhat to the left of the plan put forward by President Bill Clinton's administration. Mr Stark wants to add a new category to the government run Medicare programme which now provides health insurance for the elderly, to cover both the poor and unemployed, including those now included in the parallel government Medicaid programme.

During the Carter administration, Mr. Clinton made sure he was known inside the White House, dropping in on Mr. Eizenstat and others. Later, during the Reagan years, he used the National Governors Association as a vehicle to forge alliances with other elected Democrats.

My daughter, Caroline, graduated from Harvard recently and there was much celebration deservedly for her; more selfishly for the parent freed of forking out Pounds 25,000 plus a year. The warm glow of the three happy days of rejoicing at 'the other Cambridge' still lingers, but with it a serious thought: that whatever else they may do right or wrong, Americans understand the importance of commemorating rites of passage and there are few more serious than obtaining a university degree. More than that, marking the occasion properly is a long term investment in the future, for university and graduate alike.

The plea bargain came on charges brought by Mr Kenneth Starr, the special prosecutor appointed to look into the Whitewater affair, which involves Mr and Mrs Clinton's investment in a property venture and the failed savings and loan institution run by their business partners. Although Mr Hubbell is a close friend of the Clintons and a former law partner of Mrs Hillary Clinton, the charges against him involve no evident link to the Clintons.

The Democratic party has sought to use its convention in New York to showcase its impressive roster of female candidates for this autumn's elections, capitalising on the spreading belief that the white, male homogeneity of US political institutions desperately needs a change.

A surge of interest in the issues of sexual harassment and abortion has increased the focus on women candidates. Sexual harassment moved to the top of the political agenda during the challenge last year by Professor Anita Hill to the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas; it has been kept there by the continuing investigation into assaults on women officers at a Navy pilots' convention.

Sexual harassment moved to the top of the political agenda during the challenge last year by Professor Anita Hill to the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas; it has been kept there by the continuing investigation into assaults on women officers at a Navy pilots' convention. Nor has attention on abortion faded after the Supreme Court's mixed decision on the issue late last month.

Three White House officials yesterday gave evidence in secret to a federal grand jury investigating the Whitewater affair. Stacks of relevant documents were also turned over to the same panel, convened by Mr Robert Fiske, the independent counsel probing Whitewater. The officials called yesterday were understood to be Mr Mark Gearan, the communications director, Ms Margaret Williams, chief of staff to Mrs Hillary Clinton, and Ms Lisa Caputo, the First Lady's press secretary.

Ball State University has offered to accept a California college graduate who otherwise might have to return to junior high school because he's only 11. Adragon E. DeMello of Santa Cruz, Calif., received his bachelor's degree in mathematics last week from the University of California at Santa Cruz. But he has been turned down by several graduate scools because of his age, a Ball State official said Tuesday.

WHEN it is not consumed by the plight of Nicaraguan peasants, National Public Radio, the closest American broadcasting comes to the BBC, has a nice line in gentle humour. The other day it ran a skit in which one of its women reporters, who is unmarried and happens to have a ticket for the inaugural ball, took calls from really famous people, such as TV talk show hosts and the odd senator, all begging for a date next Wednesday night. Tickets, beds and chairs are perhaps the most important commodities in the five day multimillion dollar extravaganza that is this week's presidential inauguration.
