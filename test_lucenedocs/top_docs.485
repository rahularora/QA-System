Mr. Kalikow and Editor Jerry Nachman assembled employees in the paper's newsroom in lower Manhattan yesterday afternoon to break the news, which had been rumored in recent weeks. Post executives had denied earlier reports that the Sunday edition was closing down.

The new owner of the New York Post spent Sunday talking with advisers about how to improve the prospects for survival of the nation's oldest continuously published daily newspaper, his spokesman said. One Post employee called it the $22 million question whether multimillionaire businessman Peter Kalikow, aided by financial concessions by the Post's unions, will be able to stem the tabloid's flow of red ink. Equally intriguing was whether the real estate developer would tone down a sometimes sensationalistic style of journalism that has titillated, outraged, amused and generally entertained readers for more than a decade.

The publisher who threatened to close the New York Post unless unions accepted $19 million in job and wage cuts predicted Tuesday that profits will soon begin rolling in. More than 30 employees resigned and took sweetened severage packages the day after the union holding up the concession deal voted to take the cuts. Those leaving will get standard severance pay, along with two months pay they would have received if the 189 year old paper had shut down.

Rupert Murdoch agreed to sell his deficit ridden New York Post to real estate developer Peter S. Kalikow for $37 million if labor unions grant millions of dollars in cost savings. But the unions representing 1,200 Post employees may propose seeking another buyer on their own if they deem the cost cutting proposals too harsh, said a union official. In addition to the sale price, Mr. Kalikow agreed to assume the costs of closing the paper such as severance and pension liabilities if that becomes necessary after he becomes owner.

As a result, Mr. Kalikow's creditors, which include Bankers Trust, Manufacturers Hanover, Chase Manhattan Corp., and Citibank, are expected to meet sometime soon to devise a plan to give Mr. Kalikow time to work out his problems, persons close to the banks say. Real estate executives say Bankers Trust has lent Mr. Kalikow tens of millions of personally guaranteed money to help the developer fund the Post's operations. Some of Mr. Kalikow's more aggressive creditors, such as European American, are believed to want to be bought out of their positions by Mr. Kalikow's larger creditors, but so far the other banks have not agreed to such a deal.
