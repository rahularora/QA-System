He was 89. He died Tuesday at Chestnut Hill Hospital, where officials refused to release the cause of death. Bond, former curator of ornithology at the Academy of Natural Sciences, was the leading authority on birds of the West Indies for more than half a century and is best known scientifically for proving that birds of the Caribbean originated in North America, not South America.

It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born, Fleming wrote years later to Bond's wife, Mary Fanning Wickham Bond.

Something there is about an actor who loves the act of giving, so it was nice to find a bunch of Santa Clauses running around the set of the new James Bond movie, License Revoked. Timothy Dalton has been very giving as an actor, said Robert Davi, forgetting for the moment that his villainous character spends the last part of the movie trying to grind Dalton Bond into cocaine dust. I don't think you can create anything if you don't give, returned Dalton, who manages to give Davi's character a hole in the head.

Timothy Dalton was faced with two of the toughest acts to follow, but he has managed by talent and sheer perseverance to bring James Bond to life in a new, modernized style that could carry 007 into the 21st century. The 44 year old Briton was here for the opening of Licence to Kill, 16th of the adventures (not counting two unofficial films) that have generated more dollars than any film series in movie history. Most critics have found Dalton at ease in his second go round as Bond; his first, The Living Daylights, was not written for him.

John Gardner is not just a thriller writer but a master of a very special art: the posthumous sequel. At his home in this English village west of London, the 61 year old author writes James Bond novels, having picked up where 007's creator, Ian Fleming, left off when he died in 1964. While American writer Alexandra Ripley is just beginning a sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind, Gardner has already turned out seven Bond novels, each a best seller in the United States.

Welsh actor Timothy Dalton, who earned agent 007's license to kill in the James Bond film The Living Daylights, has had his license renewed for the next Bond movie, License Revoked. Dalton, trained as a Shakespearean actor, performed many of his own stunts in The Living Daylights, in which Bond battles a nefarious international arms smuggler while courting femme fatale Maryam D'Abo. Dalton's performance proved he was the right man to pick up the keys to the Aston Martin and carry on in the tradition of Sean Connery and Roger Moore, who starred in previous Bond thrillers, said Amy Kimmelman, a United Artists spokeswoman.

17F:THE LIFE OF IAN FLEMING by Donald McCormick Peter Owen Pounds 18.50, 232 pages IN 1966 John Pearson wrote a good biography of Ian Fleming, who had died, only 56, two years before. Its weakness was that it became extremely sketchy about the last years, so much so that many readers must have guessed that Pearson had run into problems, presumably with the widow, Ann, formerly Lady Rothermere. This book, which is no way a serious biography and scarcely a 'reappraisal' as claimed but a series of observations on Fleming's interesting life, is free of that inhibition.

<P> James Bond Triumphs: Timothy Dalton, star of the latest James Bond films, was awarded unspecified libel damages at a London court Tuesday from the publishers of a North American movie magazine that suggested he was going to be booted from the Bond role. Dalton's lawyer, Philip Conway, said the reports in Globe magazine that the actor could be dropped to save future James Bond films from financial disaster were untrue and had distressed and embarrassed him. Conway said the producers of the films were very satisfied with Dalton's performances in The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill.

Not so long ago a friend confessed that he had been to Dukes Hotel in St James's, central London, and ordered a dry martini. The barman at Dukes, Gilberto Preti, is rumoured to make the best martinis in London, but my friend found that he had been unable to finish the glass: it was just that bit too strong, and just a little bit too dry. It is that austere and uncompromising side of the martini which makes it the greatest of cocktails.

When a medical emergency arises on the set of a movie, it's not always part of the script. So when Dr. James D'Orta is not setting a broken bone at Baltimore's Franklin Square Hospital or patching up a shooting victim at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, the emergency medicine specialist usually can be found on location. D'Orta is the founder of LifeStar International, a Washington based medical consulting firm that expands the walls of the emergency room to movie sets.

D'Orta is the founder of LifeStar International, a Washington based medical consulting firm that expands the walls of the emergency room to movie sets. He and his colleagues have provided advance planning and emergency medical care on the set for three recent movies: Licence to Kill and Arnold Schwarzenegger's Total Recall, both filmed in Mexico City; and The Abyss, an underwater thriller filmed in an abandoned nuclear power plant that was converted into a film studio in Gaffney, S.C. We're like the sprinkler heads in skyscrapers, said D'Orta.

The restructuring of Engelhard Corp., the metals and chemical company once headed by the supposed model for James Bond nemesis Goldfinger, could mean higher profits and a clearer corporate identity, analysts said Friday. Engelhard, a leading metals refiner and maker of gold and silver products, says it is selling those businesses to concentrate on chemical production and its promise of higher profit margins. The Iselin based concern also has announced a restructuring that will shed 500 salaried jobs from its 8,100 member workforce and shut a number of plants worldwide.

It quotes liberally from Burton's writings and puts a lot of the explorer's life in the context of the times, drawing upon Rice's considerable knowledge of Eastern religions and cultures. Throughout, Rice's admiration of Burton is clear, and he makes some controversial assertions.

Former White House press secretary James S. Brady says he's ready to become an advocate for the disabled now that he's overcome a head wound suffered in the 1981 assassination attempt on then President Reagan. Brady, 48, who retired from the White House recently, said Monday he accepted an unpaid position as vice chairman of the National Organization on Disability, a private, non profit group. Now that I'm one of the 37 million people with disabilities, I know what it's like: the daily frustration and problems, he said at a news conference.
