A new computer system that lets doctors view a chronological sequence of electrocardiograms will help with the diagnosis of heart ailments, researchers said. The system has been tested for three years with several thousand heart patients, researchers from the University of Florida Health Science Center and Duke University Medical Center said last month. The researchers say the system offers major advantages over the standard computer analysis of single electrocardiograms, or EKGs, in detecting changes in heart function.

A specialized, tiny mirror could help scientists play a major role in a race with the Japanese to move onto the next plateau in computer technology, researchers say. The University of Arizona's Optical Sciences Laboratory makes precisely ground mirrors the size of a contact lens. Scientists hope the mirrors will aid the university's attempt to dominate a $100 billion market for faster, more powerful electronic semiconductor chips, which are the basic building blocks of modern computers and electronic devices.

About two thirds of the patients scored higher than plus 5 and constituted a low risk group, whose four year survival rate was 99%. Such a low death rate raises the question of whether such patients should be subjected to invasive diagnostic procedures that carry a slight risk of death themselves. In an editorial accompanying the report, Dr. Robert O.

The experiment, run by William G. Baxt at the University of California, San Diego Medical Center, was the first in which an artificial intelligence program matched wits so effectively against physicians. Dr. Baxt, in a report in this month's Annals of Internal Medicine, suggested that emergency room doctors under time pressure to make an instant diagnosis may someday supplement their decisions with a hand held calculator to punch in symptoms and other data into a personal computer containing the program. An editorial accompanying Dr. Baxt's report called the computer's accuracy impressive, and predicted it will encourage other investigators to try similar computer brains in aiding a wide range of doctors' diagnoses and treatment decisions.

An editorial accompanying Dr. Baxt's report called the computer's accuracy impressive, and predicted it will encourage other investigators to try similar computer brains in aiding a wide range of doctors' diagnoses and treatment decisions. The study by Baxt is an early contribution in what we expect will be a series of applications of neural networks in clinical practice, wrote Michael R.J. Guerriere and Allan S. Detsky, two Toronto physicians, in the medical journal's editorial. The neural network, according to Dr. Baxt, is a kind of artificial intelligence system that allows the programmer to train the computer to get better at making a particular diagnosis.

The new study by researchers at Cedars Sinai Medical Center checked the medical records of almost 2,300 patients who underwent coronary by pass surgery at the center between 1982 and 1987. They found that the 4.6% of the 482 women died as a result of the operation, compared with an operative mortality of only 2.6% for the more than 1,800 men who had the by pass operation. This gender difference in operative mortality has been seen in other medical centers.

But previous studies blamed the women's higher mortality on the fact that their hearts and coronary arteries are smaller than men's, making the operation technically more difficult. The operation involves taking a blood vessel from some other part of the body and stitching it to a coronary artery on the surface of the heart so that it routs blood around a clogged portion of the coronary artery.

FOR YEARS, MEDICAL RESEARCHERS have envisioned loading certain proteins with radioactive isotopes that are visible to a gamma ray camera, then injecting them into a patient to produce a scanning image of the body. Depending on the protein used, the scans would pinpoint blood clots, viruses or cancerous growths only a few cells large, greatly expanding physicians' diagnostic powers. The proteins, monoclonal antibodies, are known as the magic bullets of medicine because they seek out specific targets in the body.

Studies of silent episodes of cardiac distress show that an absence of pain does not mean an absence of heart problems, scientists reported Tuesday at a meeting of the American Heart Association. The temporary reduction of blood flow to the heart, a condition called ischemia, can occur with no symptoms and no pain, an thus are silent. Yet, doctors said at news conference, these episodes indicate that a patient may be in real danger of serious heart disease or even fatal heart attack.

Glasser of the University of South Florida College of Medicine said that though tests have proven that these silent attacks occur, scientists still don't know why some patients feel no pain. People's pain thresholds are different, he said. It might be that people with high thresholds might be more apt to have these silent episodes.

Speedier injections of clot busting drugs to heart attack victims improves their chances of escaping permanent damage, suggesting that ambulance crews can save lives by administering this medicine on the way to the hospital, a study concludes. Even when hospitals are prepared to offer this treatment, hours may pass before patients reach the emergency ward, are evaluated by heart specialists and eventually hooked up to lines that drip the medicine into their bloodstreams. The new research supports the growing belief that for this approach to work well, it must be offered fast, perhaps even before heart attack victims leave their homes.

Doctors performing a heart lung test that can cause fatal complications should receive specialized training and certification, say researchers who found many doctors have a poor grasp of the procedure. A written exam about the procedure was given to 496 physicians at 13 U.S. and Canadian hospitals. It found that 47 percent were unable to derive even the most basic information from the data generated by the test, researchers reported in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.

A computer program that helps doctors figure out which patients have suffered heart attacks could prevent about 175,000 intensive care admissions each year, saving an estimated $85 million, its developers say. The program, produced by doctors at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, is intended to help emergency room physicians determine whether patients with chest pain actually had heart attacks. In testing on 4,770 patients at six hospitals, they found that the program could have reduced needless admissions to the coronary care units by nearly 12 percent.

LOVE AND DEATH Will sex kill me? It's a question that haunts many a patient recovering from a heart attack. Sexual intercourse places about the same degree of demand on the heart as walking briskly or climbing two flights of stairs, say three University of Florida doctors in the journal Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality.

It's a question that haunts many a patient recovering from a heart attack. Sexual intercourse places about the same degree of demand on the heart as walking briskly or climbing two flights of stairs, say three University of Florida doctors in the journal Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality. Generally, if a patient can walk on a treadmill at more than two miles per hour at a 10% grade without any significant increase in blood pressure or adverse changes in the electrocardiogram, then his/her exercise capacity should be sufficient to allow for safe sexual relations with the usual partner, they write.

A minor, everyday stress like public speaking can be as damaging to the heart as strenuous exercise in people who have cardiac disease, and even can trigger heart attacks, according to research published today. The researchers found that the common stresses can cause silent ischemia, a painless but ominous disruption in the flow of blood to the heart's own muscle. The study shows that previously unrecognized mental activities have very important consequences, said Dr. Carl J. Pepine of the University of Florida.

Researchers at the American Heart Association meeting yesterday endorsed a conservative, and less invasive, form of follow up care for some heart attack patients. A federally funded study of 3,262 heart attack patients suggests the use of clot dissolving drugs needn't be followed automatically by mechanical intervention to clean out blocked coronary arteries, unless there is a demonstrated need. The study is expected to be published next month in the New England Journal of Medicine.

For the 2{ hour procedure, a flexible catheter containing a bundle of thin glass fibers is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and up the descending aorta until it reaches a blockage in the heart. Once positioned, a laser beam vaporizes plaque and opens the artery.

The cup has shown promise in animal tests. But it has been largely ignored by heart surgeons, who have focused instead on the artificial heart and sophisticated heart assist devices that are placed within the circulatory system to pump blood. In the past year, however, surgeons at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., have tested the cup in three heart failure emergencies.

Not including a onetime cost for its control console, the cup should cost much less than high technology pumps now in clinical tests perhaps 10% of the $50,000 or more of their usage.

A device that takes over the function of the heart pumping oxygenated blood throughout the body could more than double the number of people who survive sudden cardiac arrest, researchers say. In its first human test, the pump kept blood flowing through one woman for 15 hours until doctors got her heart working properly again.

Researchers reported today they have the first evidence directly linking smoking and heart disease, but tobacco industry officials rejected the claim, saying the illness can be tied to a number of causes. The study's authors say smokers were three times more likely than non smokers to have angina, or chest pains, and painless periods of inadequate blood flow to the heart. An editorial accompanying the research in the Journal of the American Medical Association said the study was the long sought smoking gun showing a link between smoking and heart ailments.

The two heart disease studies show that men are nearly twice as likely as women to receive such major procedures as coronary angiography, a crucial diagnostic test, and coronary bypass surgery. Neither report asserts that women receive inferior care, but some of the findings strongly raise the possibility. Whether it's because women aren't seeking the care, or providers aren't delivering it, we can't sort that one out, says Richard M. Steingart, cardiologist at Winthrop University Hospital, Mineola, N.Y., and principal author of one of the studies.

A heart attack usually occurs when a blood clot gets stuck in the arteries that feed the heart. Within a few hours, a section of the heart muscle dies. But if given quickly, the drugs can dissolve the clot, preventing most of the damage.

But if given quickly, the drugs can dissolve the clot, preventing most of the damage. In studies, the treatment typically has reduced the heart attack death rate from 12 percent to 6 percent. But because the therapy interferes with the body's normal tendency to make blood clots, the treatment can trigger a major side effect: unwanted bleeding.

But because the therapy interferes with the body's normal tendency to make blood clots, the treatment can trigger a major side effect: unwanted bleeding. In most parts of the body, such bleeding can be controlled. But if a blood vessel spews blood inside the brain, doctors are powerless to stop it, and the result is often a crippling stroke.
