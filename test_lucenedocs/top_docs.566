Last week's stunning jury award against Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. threatens to derail the company's pursuit of a Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. railroad unit. The success of that quest was in doubt even before the verdict, largely because Santa Fe already had accepted a competing offer from a unit of Rio Grande Industries. A federal district court jury in Sioux Falls, S.D., awarded South Dakota between $243 million and $611 million for antitrust violations and contract interference related to a coal slurry pipeline project that, the state argued, Kansas City Southern and unidentified co conspirator railroads conspired to block.

A cold front brought rain to parts of the parched upper Midwest on Friday and record chill to the sweltering Northeast, but hot, dry weather elsewhere withered crops and boosted the cost of everything from grain to fish bait. It was the eighth straight day of 100 degree heat over the central part of the nation. A plan to pour more water into the Missouri River for shipping ran aground because it would have destroyed nesting areas for endangered birds.
