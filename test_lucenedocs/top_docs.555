The Titanic went down after it struck an iceberg off Newfoundland on April 14, 1912. Only 705 of the 2,228 passengers and crew survived.

Timing apart, historians and naval experts see other parallels between the two doomed vessels. Both were designed and built to prevailing standards but both were found wanting. The Titanic was launched when the number of lifeboats carried reflected the cubic footage of the vessel devoted to passenger accommodation rather than the number of passengers and crew.

The Titanic was launched when the number of lifeboats carried reflected the cubic footage of the vessel devoted to passenger accommodation rather than the number of passengers and crew. Its designers added a 12 per cent safety margin to the minimum required by the Board of Trade but there were still only enough lifeboats for half those on board.

The 66 countries represented accounted for about 97 percent of the world's ships, said spokesman Roger Kohn.

A statement afterward called the decision one of the biggest advances in maritime communications since the introduction of radio. The new system allows the crew to send a distress signal by pushing a button, which should prevent ships disappearing without a trace when messages cannot be sent in time.

A Titan rocket today propelled into space a secret military payload that a civilian expert identified as a satellite capable of eavesdropping on Soviet military and diplomatic communications. The powerful, 16 story tall Titan 34D, scoring its third straight success after being grounded for 18 months, thundered from its launch pad at 8:05 a.m. The Air Force did not announce the launch in advance, which has been its practice on military space flights, and afterward said only that the Titan 34D, carrying a classified military payload, was successfully launched.

The $65 million Titan 34D lifted off at 3:47 p.m. Wednesday and appeared to be flying normally through a partly cloudy sky. As with other military space flights, the Air Force did not announce the launch in advance.

Europe and the United States plan to send a space probe to Titan, the solar system's biggest moon and the only one with an atmosphere much like primordial Earth's, the European Space Agency announced Friday. The joint mission to Saturn's immense, gas shrouded satellite would begin in 1996 and include a lunar probe that may be able to test soil from the mysterious moon. The mission, to be called the Cassini Titan probe, was chosen from a series of proposed joint projects during meetings Thursday and Friday of the European Space Agency's Science Program Committee.

The top price was the Pounds 66,000 (estimate Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 10,000) paid by a telephone bidder for 85 signals sent and received by the Titanic between April 12 and April 15, the morning she hit the iceberg that sank her. There was keen bidding for a 10 page letter by Harold Bride, a Marconi wireless operator on board the ship, describing his experiences, which sold for Pounds 8,250 (eight times its target).

The Air Force's last Titan 3 rocket blasted off with a secret military satellite Monday, ending a quarter century of launches by a workhorse booster that has hurled more than 200 satellites into space. The 16 story tall rocket, the powerful 34D model, brilliantly illuminated the darkness as it blazed away from its launch pad at 1:54 a.m. The Air Force said it was the 135th success in 141 launches for the Titan 3 family, a success rate of 96 percent.

A Titan 2 rocket that once sat in a silo armed with a nuclear warhead was launched into space Monday, carrying a secret Air Force payload believed to be four spy satellites designed to eavesdrop on Soviet ships. The launch marked the first time one of the refurbished missiles had been used as a space booster, and apparently was the second time U.S. spy satellites had been sent into orbit in less than a week. It was a spectacular launch with all systems operating as expected, said Air Force Capt.

It was news that the world had waited seven decades to hear. On Sept. 1, 1985, Robert D. Ballard announced that he had found and photographed the wreck of the Royal Mail Steamship Titanic, the largest and most luxurious liner that had ever plied the seas. Mr. Ballard had triumphed where many before him had failed through a combination of determination, detective work and a firm commitment to advanced technology.

The 1865 explosion of the paddlewheeler Sultana was a disaster to rival the sinking of the Titanic. The dead, many of them emaciated from Confederate prison camps, totaled more than 1,500, but newspapers of the day gave scant notice. The horror was lost in the greater gore of Civil War and presidential assassination.

For a century and a half the great ships of the Cunard line have been sailing the seas, in war and peace. Today Cunard has seven cruise ships, including the QE2, calling at 240 ports around the world. A reporter who recently took a cruise on the Black Sea in Eastern Europe tells of the line's colorful history.

Old Sam Cunard would be delighted to learn that stewards on the steamship line he launched 150 years ago still don immaculate white gloves to serve afternoon tea, that no cabin numbers end in 13 and that the ship's concert survives as the passenger talent show. He would be particularly gratified to learn that when Her Majesty calls, Cunard ships still go off to war, as the QE2 did, with a helicopter pad covering its swimming pool, in the Falkland Islands war. After all, he was knighted for deploying his entire eight ship fleet to transport troops and horses to the Crimean War.

The Air Force refused to discuss or even acknowledge the flight until about 20 minutes later, when a statement was issued.

The nation's most powerful unmanned rocket failed to lift a secret military satellite into the proper orbit, effectively rendering it useless, according to a source close to the space program. Engineers were trying to determine whether they could salvage the satellite launched atop a 16 story Titan 34D Friday morning, the source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said late Friday night. However, the source was not hopeful anything could be done to place it in the correct orbit.

The first of the Air Force's powerful new $150 million Titan 4 space rockets was transported to a launch pad Saturday under curious censorship. The 20 story tall rocket, the largest unmanned booster in the U.S. space stable, is scheduled to make its maiden flight next October, boosting a classified military reconnaissance satellite. Development of the Titan 4 was accelerated following the explosion that destroyed space shuttle Challenger in 1986.

The long delayed launch debuts of two new military space rockets, the Delta 2 and Titan 4, should occur within two months as the Air Force prepares for what could be the busiest launch year here since 1983, an official said Tuesday. The commander of the Eastern Space and Missile Center, Air Force Col. Lawrence L.

The conversion of SLC 6 will cost $300 million to $500 million, and will be faster, cheaper and environmently safer than building a new launch complex for up to $800 million, said Maj. Tom Worsdale, a Vandenberg spokesman. Pike said he believed the conversion will cost far more. He said the decision effectively forecloses ever flying the shuttle from California.

Pike said he believed the conversion will cost far more. He said the decision effectively forecloses ever flying the shuttle from California. The cost of Titan 4 and Titan 4 Centaurs ranges from $173 million to $265 million each, according to various Air Force and General Accounting Office estimates.

A Titan 4, the workhorse rocket that will let the Pentagon reduce its dependence on the space shuttle, lifted into orbit what was believed to be a satellite capable of warning against missile attack. The 20 stories tall Titan, America's mightiest unmanned rocket, lit up NASA's two shuttle launch pads a few miles away one occupied by Atlantis, the other by Columbia as it headed out over the Atlantic on Monday night. The launch had been delayed two months by problems that included leaking propellant.

The launch had been delayed two months by problems that included leaking propellant. Air Force officials refused even to acknowledge the launch prior to liftoff and would not disclose the nature of the payload, but civilian experts said they believed it was a $180 million missile warning satellite.
