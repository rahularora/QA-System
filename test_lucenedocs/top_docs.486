The Supreme Court today asked the Bush administration whether state lemon laws should be allowed to give buyers of chronically defective automobiles more legal protection than they receive under federal law. The court invited Justice Department lawyers to comment on arguments by domestic and foreign car makers that such state laws impermissibly conflict with federal law. The justices are not expected to say whether they will grant review to the manufacturers' appeal until hearing from the government, which could take months.

Washington state's automobile lemon law, designed to protect consumers who purchase defective new motor vehicles, was upheld today by a unanimous state Supreme Court. The law had been challenged by the Ford Motor Co., which contended it violates the equal protection and due process provisions of the state and U.S. constitutions. The state's interest in protecting consumers in the purchase of motor vehicles under the motor vehicles warranties law outweighs the due process considerations, Justice Charles Smith wrote for the court.

Two automobile trade associations, in a controversial move, filed a petition with the Federal Trade Commission seeking to clarify U.S. guidelines governing how and when conflicts between consumers and auto makers go to arbitration. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association and the Automobile Importers of America want the FTC to beef up a rule that currently governs voluntary arbitration under the Magnuson Moss Act of 1975. A spokesman for the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association said the rule has fallen into conflict with so called lemon laws passed by many states that often define when and how a dissatisfied car buyer can take a manufacturer to arbitration over a conflict.

A federal judge ruled that New York can require auto makers to provide basic warranties of 24 months or 18,000 miles for new vehicles sold in the state. Two groups representing U.S. and foreign auto makers had argued that the so called lemon law was unconstitutional because it regulates business outside New York and opens the door to inconsistent rules by the states. The auto makers claimed that higher costs caused by such laws would probably result in price increases nationwide.

The dispute concerns the Fed's source of strength doctrine, which requires bank holding companies to use their own assets to help their bank units that are in financial stress or adversity. The doctrine was applied by the Fed on a case by case basis until it was adopted in formal regulations issued in 1984 and 1987. Just the threat of administrative proceedings, however, has often been enough to spur bank holding companies to assist their ailing banks.

Ford Motor Co. illegally charged $100 deductibles to perform some automobile repairs it should have done in New York State for free under the state's lemon law, a mid level state appeals court ruled. The Appellate Division of the state's Supreme Court decided Thursday that Ford was unjustly enriched by charging New York consumers the deductibles and must make restitution. New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams contended in court that the state's 1983 lemon law, designed to provide New Yorkers with replacement vehicles or money back if their new cars exhibit irreparable flaws, did not allow Ford to impose the deductibles.

The settlement was reached under the state's lemon law and could set a precedent for other states, officials said.

We believe, and have suggested to the EPA, that (the) issues are of importance to the industry as a whole and should be addressed through the rule making process. A Ford spokesman said the EPA action could significantly increase Ford's warranty costs if the company has to cover repairs of faulty parts that cause emissions system failures, as well as the failed emissions systems themselves. However, company officials say they haven't yet determined how much their costs could rise.

Ford may be liable for a $250,000 civil fine if the matter goes to court and Ford is found guilty of violating the Clean Air Act. The EPA said the penalties against Ford may be mitigated if the auto maker changes the way it honors its emission system warranty and if it corrects past improper denials of warranty coverage.

A federal appeals court, in a ruling that gives a boost to auto makers, upheld the government's lowering of the 1986 fuel economy standard to 26 miles per gallon. The court said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an arm of the Transportation Department, has considerable discretion in setting the standard. That could affect pending litigation that challenges the agency's lowering of the 1987 and 1988 standards.

Congress, as part of a 1975 energy conservation law, set the standards at 27.5 mpg for model year 1985 and beyond, but gave the department authority to reduce the requirement to as low as 26 mpg if warranted.

Britain's highest court of appeal ruled against Borden's Inc. Thursday in a battle over the right to sell lemon juice in squeezable containers. The Law Lords, Britain's highest judiciary body, upheld a previous High Court ruling that bars Borden from selling its plastic lemons filled with reconstituted lemon juice in Britain because shoppers could confuse Borden's ReaLemon with a similar British product, JIF. Borden issued a statement from its headquarters in New York saying the firm disagreed with the decision but would abide by it.

The companies that make motor vehicle anti pollution equipment predict they can meet the tough emissions standards proposed in a clean air bill favored by environmentalists but denounced as too extreme by the auto industry. Strongly disagreeing with auto industry witnesses, the Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association told a House panel Tuesday that its companies could produce pollution control equipment that would meet the proposed standards for 100,000 miles of driving each vehicle. Bruce Bertlesen, executive director of the group, said the association based its assessment on continuing progress in developing better anti pollution equipment, more advanced engine controls and continued reduction of lead contamination in unleaded fuel.

The recent US Supreme Court ruling against Eastman Kodak reinstating an antitrust lawsuit filed against the photographic equipment giant in 1987 by 18 service companies, came as a rude shock to America's commercial lawyers. Lawyers for the companies, which accused Kodak of violating federal antitrust laws by operating an illegal 'tying in' agreement involving sale and repair of photocopiers, hailed it as the most important decision for US business in a decade. Mr Richard Fine, a Los Angeles attorney who filed a brief on behalf of the California State Electronics Association (CSEA) in support of the independent service providers, said the decision guaranteed survival of a domestic service industry for all products, including cars, computers and consumer electronics.

Meanwhile, Mr Fine is pursuing a Dollars 600m class action suit on behalf of CSEA against 34 of the world's biggest consumer electronics manufacturers. CSEA alleges that the makers fail to compensate independent service companies properly for doing their warranty work as required by state law. He says he is close to agreeing settlement terms with some of the companies, but last week was forced to file fresh class action damages suits against Sony, Sharp, Toshiba and Sansui, which have shown no signs of settling.

A divided federal appeals court reinstated an earlier ruling that requires the Environmental Protection Agency to adjust its fuel economy estimates for vehicles. The action may lead to increased federal penalties against General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. for falling short of federal gas mileage standards. When the original decision was issued by a three judge panel here in December 1986, the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer watchdog group, estimated that it could cost General Motors $250 million and Ford $50 million in penalties.

An alliance of government and private highway safety advocates wants to give police the power to take away a drunken driver's license on any road in the country. Claiming successes in 29 states where automatic revocation laws are in effect, the heads of the National Transportation Safety Board and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration called Wednesday for a campaign to pass similar laws in the rest of the nation. The aim is to give police in every state the power to suspend the license of a driver who refuses or fails a roadside breath test for alcohol consumption.

The Massachusetts law, to be phased in from 1995 to 2003, requires auto makers to cut new vehicles' hydrocarbon emissions to levels 75% lower than those set by the new federal law. It requires emission levels of other major smog ingredients, nitrogen oxides, to be 50% lower than required under the new federal standards. The Massachusetts law also copies California's provisions that require auto makers to continually test air pollution control systems in randomly selected vehicles they've previously sold and to correct failures.

That's what the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says. The Institute is promoting the use of daytime running lights, which it says help reduce accidents. Daytime running lights can be low beam headlights or regular parking lights, on the front or side of the car any lights that are kept on during the day.

The Institute is promoting the use of daytime running lights, which it says help reduce accidents. Daytime running lights can be low beam headlights or regular parking lights, on the front or side of the car any lights that are kept on during the day. Two years ago, the institute outfitted 2,000 rental cars with automatic daytime lights and leased an identical fleet without them.

And Canada recently passed a law requiring that all vehicles sold in the country beginning in December be outfitted with automatic daytime lights.
