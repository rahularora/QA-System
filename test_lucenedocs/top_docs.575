<P> Fifth ranked Illinois remained unbeaten in Big Ten play, defeating Wisconsin, 21 3, Saturday at Madison, Wis. </P> <P> Illinois Coach John Mackovic credited his team's defense, which had to play well because the offense was not productive. </P> <P> Offensively we had way too many turnovers, but fortunately our defense did what was needed, said Mackovic, whose team is 6 1 overall and 4 0 in the Big Ten. They kept the pressure on Wisconsin's quarterbacks, which reduced their effectiveness.
