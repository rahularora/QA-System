Japanese automakers are still producing the most fuel efficient cars tiny compacts getting up to 55 miles per gallon while the list of gas guzzlers is dominated by expensive, luxurious European models, government fuel economy figures showed Monday. The vehicle mileage survey, based on industry and government tests on all 1990 model cars, trucks and vans, showed little change over the previous year, although the number of vehicles subject to the guzzler tax dropped from 40 to 32. The tax, which can add $3,850 to the price of a car, kicks in on automobiles that get overall fuel efficiency of less than 22.5 miles per gallon.

For the past three model years, Ford has joined General Motors Corp. and a consortium of auto importers in asking the government to ease the so called CAFE standards for cars. In response to the auto makers' appeals, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration rolled back the target to 26 miles per gallon from 27.5 for the 1986, 1987 and 1988 model years. Chrysler Corp. opposed those efforts.

Imported cars dominate both the best and the worst categories in the annual survey of automobile gas mileage released today by the Environmental Protection Agency. Overall, automakers made little gain in gasoline mileage in the 1990 model year, although the number of cars mostly expensive super luxury imports that trigger the federal gas guzzler tax dropped from 40 car types to 30. There is no significant difference in the fuel economy of the top 10 1990 models compared to the top 10 1989 models.

Automakers are showing little or no gain in fuel economy for the fifth straight year, with 1991 model cars having on average as much thirst at the gas pumps as they did in 1987, the government reported today. The Environmental Protection Agency released the new fuel economy figures as the Senate considered legislation that would require sharp improvements in automobile fuel efficiency over the next decade. According to the EPA's annual fuel economy statistics covering about 1,000 cars, the 1991 models both domestics and imports show an overall average of 28.1 miles per gallon, slightly better than last year and identical to the fleet average in 1987.

Auto makers for the 1990 model year are required to produce fleets with an average fuel efficiency of 27.5 mpg, stricter than that required over the past four years.

The U.S. secretary of transportation said he wants a relaxation of congressionally mandated fuel economy standards for cars, a move that would clear the way for auto makers to sell bigger cars and earn larger profits. Calling current fuel economy rules a dinosaur that should be extinct, the official, James Burnley, sided with the auto industry in the battle over efforts to require improved gas mileage.

On a single mile per gallon, to hear the interested parties tell it, hangs the U.S. trade balance, the ability of the domestic auto industry to compete, the nation's energy independence, thousands of highway traffic deaths, even the capacity of the Earth's climate to support humankind. A welter of comment offered at hearings this past week lead to those assorted conclusions.

Detroit's cars are far more efficient than the gas guzzlers of a decade ago, but Japanese auto makers still have the edge if American consumers become mileage conscious again. Japanese car makers have the advantage not just in raw miles per gallon numbers. They also have used their lead in small engine technology to develop four cylinder cars that have the pep of an American six cylinder.

Honda executives disclosed the fuel economy capabilities of the new Civic model during a Senate hearing on a proposal that would force car makers to increase the average fuel economy of their cars by 40% by the end of the century. But Thomas Elliott, executive vice president of Honda's U.S. sales arm, downplayed the potential market significance of the car. He said the proposed mileage standards would limit competition and result in higher prices for smaller, less comfortable cars.

U.S. automakers will have to improve fuel economy to 27.5 miles per gallon on 1990 passenger models, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said Wednesday. I'm hopeful this will be an incentive to (auto makers) to explore better ways to develop better engines and get better mileage, Skinner said at a news conference after a speech to the Chicago Association of Commerce and Industry. We've got to get beyond where we are today, in miles per gallon, if we're going to deal with this energy crisis.

Pressure to save fuel could increase highway deaths, an auto safety group said Wednesday in reporting new evidence that small cars are less safe than bigger models. The study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety concludes that, on average, small cars are deadlier than less fuel efficient autos, that Japanese cars are becoming longer and safer while American cars are becoming shorter and more dangerous, and that when a manufacturer reduces the size of a given model, the model becomes more dangerous. In a broad study begun well before the Mideast crisis brought new attention to ways of decreasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil, the institute said safety too often is ignored in the debate over auto mileage standards.

US CAR manufacturers yesterday joined the federal government in a research programme aimed at developing cleaner cars with three times the fuel economy of today's models. The programme will pool resources from General Motors, Ford and Chrysler with those of the government's space, defence and nuclear weapons laboratories, and will redirect government research spending. 'Our long term goal is to develop affordable, attractive cars that are up to three times more fuel efficient than today's cars three times and meet strict standards for urban air pollution, safety, performance and comfort,' President Bill Clinton said at a White House ceremony yesterday to launch the initiative.

The incentive financing program, which began Aug. 9 and runs until Sept. 3, will allow Escort and Tracer buyers to obtain 4.8% financing on loans up to 48 months. In 10 northeastern states, buyers will have the option of taking $500 cash instead of the budget financing. The moves come on top of an earlier Ford program that gives $500 to Escort and Tracer buyers who are purchasing their first car.

Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley today told automakers they must achieve an average fuel economy of 26.5 miles per gallon for 1989 model cars higher than required this year but less than mandated under a law Burnley has the power to change. He said his action, cutting 1.0 mpg off the standard Congress told manufacturers to meet for 1989 models, was designed to help the U.S. auto industry compete abroad. Each automaker is required to post an average fuel economy of at least 26.0 mpg for all of its 1988 models.

The Transportation Department on Monday set fuel economy standards for 1989 passenger cars at 26.5 miles per gallon of gasoline, a level the nation's two largest automakers say they could meet without layoffs and production cuts. The department's decision kept the fuel economy average required for each auto manufacturer from increasing to the 27.5 mpg enacted by Congress in 1975. Since 1986, the automakers have been required to meet a 26 mpg standard.

A federal appeals court here ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency must recalculate fuel economy figures for vehicles made since 1980 in a way that would result in increased federal penalties against Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. The Center for Auto Safety, an industry watchdog group based here, said the decision could cost General Motors $250 million and Ford $50 million in penalties for failing to meet U.S. mileage standards. The ruling came in a challenge by the auto safety center to a June 1985 decision by the EPA to retroactively boost its estimates of vehicles' gas mileage.

Chrysler Corp. announced the layoffs of 4,000 workers Friday in a series of moves that included ending production of two subcompact cars in Detroit, eliminating a shift at a carmaking plant in St. Louis and closing a supply plant in Wisconsin. The moves are part of a Chrysler plan announced earlier this year to slash $1 billion of the company's annual $26 billion budget by the end of 1990. I guess (Chrysler Chairman Lee) Iacocca was serious when he said he saw a recession coming, independent auto analyst Dave Healy said from New York City.

GM and the Automobile Importers of America, which represents all Japanese automakers and all but two European makers, have asked that the 27.5 mpg standard for 1989 be reduced to 26 mpg standard that was in effect for 1986, 1987 and 1988 models. Benton said Ford would break with the other automakers and added that Ford is continuously reducing the weight of its cars and engines.

The U.S. economy would lose $4.80 for every gallon of gas saved in steering car buyers away from the convenience and pleasure of bigger cars, according to a government economist. The economist, Andrew N. Kleit, a member of the Federal Trade Commission staff, argues that car buyers should not be induced to give up big cars and says just as much fuel would be saved by an additional tax on gasoline of 2 or 3 cents a gallon. People clearly get pleasure from buying large cars and I don't see anything illicit in that at all, Kleit said in an interview about his report, The Impact of Automobile Fuel Economy Standards.

Legislation to abolish federal fuel economy standards was introduced Wednesday by Rep. Bob Carr, D Mich., who argued that the rules cause the economy to suffer in Michigan and the nation. Carr's bill, which he first introduced last year, would end the corporate average fuel economy regulations that require automakers to attain a certain minimum gasoline mileage on average throughout their fleets of passenger cars. CAFE is a government regulation that is simply not needed, said Carr.

Transportation Secretary James Burnley, in a move that delighted U.S. auto makers, lowered the gasoline mileage requirement for 1989 model passenger cars to 26.5 miles per gallon from the congressionally set standard of 27.5 mpg. Mr. Burnley agreed with the domestic auto industry that the tougher standard would cost U.S. jobs and help foreign manufacturers. Keeping the 27.5 mpg standard for the 1989 model year, which applies to the average mileage for a car maker's entire fleet, would have clearly put our domestic full line manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage compared to some foreign manufacturers, especially Asians, who have been building only small cars and can easily meet the fuel economy requirements, Mr. Burnley said.

But, instead of preserving U.S. jobs, the dual fleet system is encouraging the Big Three to move jobs connected to big car production offshore. Japanese auto makers, meanwhile, say they're discouraged from employing more Americans and buying more American parts.
