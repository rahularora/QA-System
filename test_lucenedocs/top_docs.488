LANDLOCKED Bolivia's 113 year old dream of an exit to the Pacific is set to become reality today when Bolivian and Peruvian presidents Jaime Paz Zamora and Alberto Fujimori meet in the southern Peruvian port of Ilo to sign a bilateral agreement. Peru's President Alberto Fujimori has made an offer of free transit for Bolivian products through a 'corridor' leading to Ilo from the Bolivian frontier town of Desaguadero. Under Mr Fujimori's proposal: Bolivia would be permitted to import and export via Ilo with no customs formalities perhaps even using their own railway stock on the Peruvian tracks; Ilo would become a free zone with full industrial and commercial facilities; and, Bolivians could even purchase their own seaside residences in a new tourist resort on Peruvian soil.

In return for the concessions, Peru would gain access to the Atlantic, via the network of roads and railways which link Desaguadero to the Bolivian capital, La Paz, and thence to Brazil, Paraguay and northern Argentina.

Like President Sanchez de Lozada himself, two of Bolivia's most far sighted men are entrepreneurs who, after spending many years outside their native land, have returned and succeeded in transforming a personal vision into reality. One is Mr Joaquin Aguirre, author, philosopher, playwright, businessman and now the owner of Bolivia's only genuinely functioning port on the Paraguay River: it bears his name, Puerto Aguirre. 'The Paraguay Parana hidrovia (waterway) is to our continent what the Mississippi is to the US,' he says, 'but over the centuries Latin Americans have done everything possible to ignore it.

BFN [Text] La Paz, 22 Jun (LOS TIEMPOS) The metaphor about the milk and the cow was thoroughly explained today by President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, when he said that even if Bolivia gets a sovereign sea outlet it wants to take concrete steps on the sea issue with Chile it must also get several outlets on both the Pacific and Atlantic, with the full use of the port of Ilo in Peru as well as the Paraguay Parana waterway and other ports in Argentina and Uruguay. Even though the sea outlet claim is a valid issue, though problematic and difficult, we want to make progress in all fields cultural, political, and economic in all fields related to our great effort to have a sea outlet on the Pacific and outlets through the waterway, said President Sanchez at a news conference held today to talk about the positive aspects of his tour of the United States and Colombia. The controversial statement made by President Sanchez de Lozada after meeting with Chilean President Eduardo Frei prompted a wave of protests for an allegedly antipatriotic policy on the sea outlet issue.

The government has some Dollars 280m in its present annual budget for roads, 'but we need to find new sources of financing construction,' says Mr Paz. One plan is to hive off as concessions certain potentially profitable sections to private companies which would build, collect tolls and maintain highways.

CONQUISTADORES, explorers and traders once used the rivers of South America to penetrate, subdue and settle the continent's heartland. But today the rivers which form some of the world's greatest navigable waterways are underused and vast regions of the interior isolated and impoverished. But there are signs that the Parana Paraguay rivers, which together form South America's largest river system after the Amazon, could become an important trade corridor linking the distant, landlocked interior with seaports at the River Plate estuary.

John Paul's 12 day itinerary will take him to Uruguay and Peru, both for the second time, to impoverished Bolivia, high in the Andes, and to a meeting in Paraguay with strongman Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. The tour, John Paul's 37th foreign pilgrimage since he became pope nine years ago, is a sign of the importance the Vatican gives to an area expected to include half of the world's Roman Catholics by the end of the century.

Wracked by crushing indebtedness and recession for seven years, the continent that began the 1980s in the flush of a democratic rennaissance is ending the decade weary and frustrated.

Petrobras, Brazil's oil and gas monopoly, took a particularly aggressive stance in the negotiations, arguing that Bolivia, one of Latin America's poorest countries, badly needed the project to earn foreign exchange and that Brazil was Bolivia's only potential customer on the continent. The biggest row, which President Sanchez de Lozada and Brazil's President Itamar Franco have been trying to defuse this week, is over shareholdings.

Brazil's constitution assures Petrobras a monopoly over the production and import of oil and natural gas in Brazil. Petrobras believes this means it should hold 51 per cent of the shares in the Brazilian portion of the pipeline, easily the largest section.

In what might have been a bid to head off further debate over shareholdings, Petrobras announced at the weekend that it would work with BTB, a joint venture between BHP, Tenneco and British Gas, on the project, with BTB holding a significant but as yet undefined shareholding.

Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN <F P=106> [ Exclusive interview with Bolivian President Gonzalo </F> Sanchez de Lozada by an unidentified EL PAIS reporter during his visit to Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay for the Common Market of the South, Mercosur, summit on 17 January] [Text] [EL PAIS] You have often said that Bolivia is trying to be like Dona Flor and her two husbands [reference to novel by Brazilian writer Jorge Amado]. What exactly does that mean? [Sanchez de Lozada] Well, I said that because, above all, Bolivia has three destinies: one linked to the River Plate region, another to the Amazon River region, and the third to the Pacific Ocean.
 FBIS3-32085 
What exactly does that mean? [Sanchez de Lozada] Well, I said that because, above all, Bolivia has three destinies: one linked to the River Plate region, another to the Amazon River region, and the third to the Pacific Ocean. I think that beyond this remark, our presence here in Uruguay is the result of our belief that our destiny linked to the River Plate region is the strongest one.

[Sanchez de Lozada] Well, I said that because, above all, Bolivia has three destinies: one linked to the River Plate region, another to the Amazon River region, and the third to the Pacific Ocean. I think that beyond this remark, our presence here in Uruguay is the result of our belief that our destiny linked to the River Plate region is the strongest one. Our immediate and future realities are closely linked to the Parana Paraguay River Waterway.

I think that beyond this remark, our presence here in Uruguay is the result of our belief that our destiny linked to the River Plate region is the strongest one. Our immediate and future realities are closely linked to the Parana Paraguay River Waterway. We hope that, based on agreements reached between Uruguay and Argentina, these two countries can establish with the others that will join them in this waterway an organization that can integrate them all.

Our immediate and future realities are closely linked to the Parana Paraguay River Waterway. We hope that, based on agreements reached between Uruguay and Argentina, these two countries can establish with the others that will join them in this waterway an organization that can integrate them all. For Bolivia, this waterway represents an outlet to the sea.

We hope that, based on agreements reached between Uruguay and Argentina, these two countries can establish with the others that will join them in this waterway an organization that can integrate them all. For Bolivia, this waterway represents an outlet to the sea. It will protect the eastern region of our country, where there is great potential in the exploitation of iron, gas, and soybeans.
 FBIS3-32085 
For Bolivia, this waterway represents an outlet to the sea. It will protect the eastern region of our country, where there is great potential in the exploitation of iron, gas, and soybeans. In this regard river transportation is really decisive.
 FBIS3-32085 
It will protect the eastern region of our country, where there is great potential in the exploitation of iron, gas, and soybeans. In this regard river transportation is really decisive. Our presence and closeness with Mercosur becomes, therefore, a priority.

In this regard river transportation is really decisive. Our presence and closeness with Mercosur becomes, therefore, a priority. Just like Dona Flor, we would like to have two husbands (Mercosur and the Andean Pact).

Our presence and closeness with Mercosur becomes, therefore, a priority. Just like Dona Flor, we would like to have two husbands (Mercosur and the Andean Pact). It seems, however, that our priority is Mercosur.

It seems, however, that our priority is Mercosur. This is why we want to hold bold, but prudent, talks. We want to become part of the locomotive instead of waiting to be run over by it.

We want to become part of the locomotive instead of waiting to be run over by it. We believe that the locomotive is here, that it is the critical argument that will allow us to negotiate with the other economic blocs. In addition to that, our destiny is closely linked to this river basin that permits everything to become a unity instead of a diversity.

We believe that the locomotive is here, that it is the critical argument that will allow us to negotiate with the other economic blocs. In addition to that, our destiny is closely linked to this river basin that permits everything to become a unity instead of a diversity. [EL PAIS] Why do you link the waterway to the River Plate?
 FBIS3-32085 
In addition to that, our destiny is closely linked to this river basin that permits everything to become a unity instead of a diversity. [EL PAIS] Why do you link the waterway to the River Plate? Institutionally, they are two different things.
 FBIS3-32085 
[EL PAIS] Why do you link the waterway to the River Plate? Institutionally, they are two different things. [Sanchez de Lozada] It is very hard to separate a tree from its roots.

Institutionally, they are two different things. [Sanchez de Lozada] It is very hard to separate a tree from its roots. The whole thing begins here.
 FBIS3-32085 
[Sanchez de Lozada] It is very hard to separate a tree from its roots. The whole thing begins here. We can separate the two things, but we believe that our concept of fresh water and cheap, effective transportation is a way of reaching the other parts of the world.
 FBIS3-32085 
The whole thing begins here. We can separate the two things, but we believe that our concept of fresh water and cheap, effective transportation is a way of reaching the other parts of the world. It is the destiny of all countries, particularly the landlocked ones, to find a sea outlet.
 FBIS3-32085 
We can separate the two things, but we believe that our concept of fresh water and cheap, effective transportation is a way of reaching the other parts of the world. It is the destiny of all countries, particularly the landlocked ones, to find a sea outlet. This cannot be done unless we join the River Plate system.
 FBIS3-32085 
It is the destiny of all countries, particularly the landlocked ones, to find a sea outlet. This cannot be done unless we join the River Plate system. This is not an imposition, but it seems to apply.
 FBIS3-32085 
This cannot be done unless we join the River Plate system. This is not an imposition, but it seems to apply. In addition, Argentina and Uruguay had to overcome several difficulties, and needed a lot of time before achieving the experience they now have.
 FBIS3-32085 
This is not an imposition, but it seems to apply. In addition, Argentina and Uruguay had to overcome several difficulties, and needed a lot of time before achieving the experience they now have. A joint administration is the first step toward achieving an administrative system similar to those prevailing in several other international river systems.

In addition, Argentina and Uruguay had to overcome several difficulties, and needed a lot of time before achieving the experience they now have.

It would be an administrative support to this exceedingly complex system.

 FBIS3-32085 
[EL PAIS] Does Paraguay agree to this position? [Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, I believe it does. We are very close to Paraguay.
 FBIS3-32085 
[Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, I believe it does. We are very close to Paraguay. Our relations have changed very much after decades of susceptibilities and clashes resulting from the Chaco War.
 FBIS3-32085

 FBIS3-32085 
[EL PAIS] You talked about the possibility of seeking a way of integration between Bolivia and Mercosur through a free trade zone. In this regard what could be obtained, taking into account that for five years Bolivia cannot become a Mercosur member? [Sanchez de Lozada] ...No, in 1996... but if there is the political will, we could become a member tomorrow.
 FBIS3-32085 
In this regard what could be obtained, taking into account that for five years Bolivia cannot become a Mercosur member? [Sanchez de Lozada] ...No, in 1996... but if there is the political will, we could become a member tomorrow. If there is consensus, an exception could be made.
 FBIS3-32085 
[Sanchez de Lozada] ...No, in 1996... but if there is the political will, we could become a member tomorrow. If there is consensus, an exception could be made. This is what we seek: By being an observer, we are linked to Mercosur; it is a bit uncomfortable, but we are linked to it.
 FBIS3-32085 
If there is consensus, an exception could be made. This is what we seek: By being an observer, we are linked to Mercosur; it is a bit uncomfortable, but we are linked to it. Seeking a free trade zone is like supporting Mercosur; although it is still not a common market, it has no tariff.
 FBIS3-32085 
This is what we seek: By being an observer, we are linked to Mercosur; it is a bit uncomfortable, but we are linked to it. Seeking a free trade zone is like supporting Mercosur; although it is still not a common market, it has no tariff. Therefore, it is a bit like getting to the point where the other countries already are.

Seeking a free trade zone is like supporting Mercosur; although it is still not a common market, it has no tariff.

Therefore, it is a bit like getting to the point where the other countries already are.

And the three of us have to face the pressures from Brazil and Argentina. Although the situation has changed, the relative size of our countries make us feel united in many ways, and there is also a lot of affinity and closeness on international issues.

[EL PAIS] Your country has in the Andean Pact a special treatment on tariffs. Would Bolivia be willing to accept integration into a group like Mercosur, in which high tariffs are proposed for some products to protect an industry?

Would your country be willing to join even when it has always enjoyed low tariffs? Would it pay that price? [Sanchez de Lozada] We will see about paying the price.
 FBIS3-32085 
Would it pay that price? [Sanchez de Lozada] We will see about paying the price. What we want is to participate, and to convince the large nations that high tariffs are a way of guaranteeing that their industries will never be competitive.
 FBIS3-32085 
[Sanchez de Lozada] We will see about paying the price. What we want is to participate, and to convince the large nations that high tariffs are a way of guaranteeing that their industries will never be competitive. We are not dogmatic, but a very poor country like Bolivia has come to the conclusion that protectionism stops the absorption of advanced technology.

What we want is to participate, and to convince the large nations that high tariffs are a way of guaranteeing that their industries will never be competitive. We are not dogmatic, but a very poor country like Bolivia has come to the conclusion that protectionism stops the absorption of advanced technology. Because it is only human nature when a businessman is protected, he will not seek competition.

We are not dogmatic, but a very poor country like Bolivia has come to the conclusion that protectionism stops the absorption of advanced technology. Because it is only human nature when a businessman is protected, he will not seek competition.

Because it is only human nature when a businessman is protected, he will not seek competition. And one of the reasons why we want to participate is because we believe that sometimes logic, explanation, and experience have a great deal of influence, especially in countries which are facing very powerful sectors.

Apparently there is a bloc that functions well; Venezuela and Colombia, and the rest were left behind. [Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, this is a complex situation. Remember that for various reasons our activities and attention have been especially dedicated to Chile and to Mercosur.

Bolivia and Chile have had no diplomatic ties since 1962 except for a brief three year period (1975 78) as a result of a territorial dispute and Bolivia's demand for a sovereign sea outlet to the Pacific across land that has belonged to Chile since the 19th century.

Governing party candidate Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada today claimed an upset election victory over former military dictator Hugo Banzer Suarez, but the congress will have final say over who becomes president. Neither candidate appeared to have won more than 50 percent of the vote in Sunday's election so, by law, the new congress will choose the president. Nevertheless, Sanchez de Lozada's surprising finish provided a kind of public endorsement of the government's conservative, free market economic program, which has included severe austerity measures.

Now, once again, the peace may be about to be disrupted. Plans are under way to transform the Paraguay and Parana rivers into a 3,400km waterway that would link the often impoverished interior with seaports at the River Plate estuary.

Across South America, the crushing burden of foreign debt piled up largely by military governments no longer in power is stifling economies, stirring unrest in the masses and threatening fragile democracies. Some leaders see the crisis as an opening for radical populists with radical solutions debt moratoriums or outright repudiation of debt, for example and, in turn, the possibility of military rule once more. Foreign debt is likely to be a major issue in presidential elections this year Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay.

CAPTAIN Luis Aranda is the proud commander of the fleet of the fourth base of the Bolivian navy. But the only ships at his command are those he makes at home from matchsticks, along with a motley flotilla of five small metal ferry and patrol boats that are gently rusting in the waters of Lake Titicaca. Aranda's 150 strong division spends most of its time raising chickens and cultivating prize tomatoes.
