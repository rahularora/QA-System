Just eight weeks after Florida's $55.1 million jackpot eclipsed lottomania in California, the Golden State is back with a $55 million plus jackpot that will be North America's richest ever. Lottery officials and merchants said ticket sales for Saturday's drawing already were double what an average Thursday would rake in. The official estimate of over $55 million for the drawing is conservative, based on previous betting patterns in the two year history of California's computerized lottery game, said lottery spokesman Bob Taylor.

Over $55 million could mean several million dollars over, officials acknowledge. It all depends on how wildly Californians react to the 1 in 14 million chance of winning the jackpot, which would be paid in an annuity of at least $2.75 million before taxes for 20 years, for the cost of a $1 lotto ticket.

It all depends on how wildly Californians react to the 1 in 14 million chance of winning the jackpot, which would be paid in an annuity of at least $2.75 million before taxes for 20 years, for the cost of a $1 lotto ticket. The size of the jackpot depends on sales and jackpot rollovers, which fuel each other to produce the heavy gambling periods dubbed lottomania. When no one picks all six winning numbers out of a choice of 49 numbers, the jackpot is rolled over, or added, to the top prize for the next twice weekly drawing.

A projected $55 million plus lottery prize that would return the North American title for big jackpots to the state is making Californians' gambling fever rise again.

The official estimate of over $55 million for the drawing is conservative, based on similar situations in the two year history of California's computerized Lotto 6 49 game, said lottery spokesman Bob Taylor.

RULE ONE in the lottery business: The bigger the jackpot, the more tickets you sell. So if you're running a state lottery that offers relatively small cash awards, and you know that hundreds perhaps thousands of your potential customers are playing the multimillion dollar lottery in the big state next door, your strategy is pretty clear: Double, triple or quadruple your own grand prize, and keep those ticket sales at home. That's exactly what Iowa and Missouri, whose citizens are regular players in the wealthy lottery in neighboring Illinois, hope to do.
