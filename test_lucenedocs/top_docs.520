THE merger with Fisher Price will transform Mattel, the number two US toy maker, into a worthy rival to industry leader Hasbro, swelling Mattel's market share from 11 per cent to 15 per cent, just short of Hasbro's 16 per cent share. The next biggest company is Tyco, accounting for 5 per cent of the market, according to Mr Gary Jacobson, analyst at Kidder Peabody.

When Ronald Reagan was preparing to debate Jimmy Carter in 1980, Stanford University economist Michael J. Boskin had a background role as a practice questioner. One administration later, Boskin is providing some answers for George Bush in his drive for the presidency. Boskin, 42, is by all accounts ready to follow Bush to the White House in January to collect the reward due a highly regarded, staunchly loyal Republican economist.
