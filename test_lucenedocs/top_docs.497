CBS Inc. unveiled its most radically restructured fall prime time television schedule ever in a gamble to revive its stagnant ratings. The company said its second ranked television network, which posted its lowest prime time ratings ever in the just ended 1986 87 season, will replace eight of its 22 hours of weekly prime time programming in September and bring back 15 current series. That is the most hours of programming ever replaced by the CBS network, topping the 7 1/2 hours it scrapped in fall 1977, CBS research officials said.

Now, like the fictional TV station that will be depicted in WIOU for CBS Inc.'s network, Mr. Tinker is poised to begin again, this time without a company handing him a blank check. He has yet to find another financial partner despite hiring the investment banking firm of Furman Selz Mager Dietz &amp; Birney in January. New backers may well be leery; Gannett spent more than $40 million in prime time production costs, more than another $45 million on USA Today on TV, $24 million to buy the Culver City studios for the venture and another $25 million in renovations.
