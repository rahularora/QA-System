Many British schoolteachers have trouble spelling, can't do a simple sum and don't know West Germany's capital, according to a survey published Sunday. The Sunday Times commissioned a general knowledge survey of 308 teachers in primary, junior high and high schools nationwide and reported three quarters of them could not spell embarrass, satellite and harassment. Almost all made mistakes over the 16 simple questions on current affairs, geography, spelling, maths, science, history and literature, said the weekly, which commissioned the telephone survey from Market Opinion and Research International.

Drilon said the Magna Carta provisions cannot be amended by the Final Act of the Uruguay Round. While the Philippines adopts the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land in consonance with the Constitution, Drilon said, it has been said that a municipal law which is in conflict with a rule of international law will often be given effect in municipal courts since the latter are organs of municipal law and are bound by it.

However, Drilon said, if the Final Act of the Uruguay Round is subjected to the Senate ratification pursuant to the Constitution, our reply to this particular query might be different if we are to consider and apply the American jurisprudential rule that a treaty may supersede a prior act of Congress in the same manner that an act of Congress may supersede a prior treaty.

Navarro also asked whether non implementation by the president or the secretary of agriculture of the trade provision of the Magna Carta hold them liable for action by interest groups.

Kennedy today walked across a field and climbed a tree lined stone path to the roughly oblong, five foot high slab of stone that is Britain's tribute to the assassinated president. Wearing a black trenchcoat, he placed the flower at the foot of the memorial, crossed himself and mouthed a silent prayer.

Magna spokesman Brian Colburn called the agreement with Ford a vote of confidence in Magna's ability to continue operating. Magna, which has been plagued by overcapacity and a slowdown in the auto industry, supplies parts to all of the Big Three U.S. auto makers. Under terms of the agreement, a Ford subsidiary will acquire 49% and Magna will own 51% of a new company, Conix Canada Inc., that has been set up to acquire various assets from Magna's Decoma International Inc. unit.

WINDSOR CASTLE is the largest inhabited castle in the world and has been the sovereign's official residence for more than 800 years. The original castle at Windsor, a fortified earthwork surrounded by a dry ditch, was built by William the Conqueror in about 1070 as one of a chain of strongholds to control the area around London. It was rebuilt and enlarged over the centuries, although the outline still follows the shape of the original earthwork.

But the real miracle on the Delaware is that Philadelphians have given us a stimulating, not snooze inducing, history lesson. Let's face it: The Constitution doesn't have the appeal of that soaring symbol of freedom, the Statue of Liberty, nor does it warm the patriotic heart like the Declaration of Independence.

John F. Kennedy's family and friends paused Tuesday to celebrate his life and mourn the dreadful moment 25 years ago when the youthful president was murdered in Dallas and the heartbeat of a nation stood still. Kennedy was remembered in the salutes of an elite Army unit, in the simple, graveside tribute of his longtime secretary, in a private Mass for his widow and children, in a vigil in the Capitol Rotunda, and with flowers at home and abroad including the single white rose left by his youngest and only surviving brother at a historic meadow in England. Although no official ceremonies were held in Dallas, about 2,500 people thronged Dealey Plaza, where Kennedy was felled by an assassin's rifle as he waved to crowds from an open limousine at midday Nov. 22, 1963.

The amended pact calls for the exchange ratio of stock to fluctuate between 0.62 and 1.033 shares of Magna, if the average market value of Magna's common stock is between $9 and $15 during a specified 20 day period. Magna would thus issue between 4.5 million and 7.5 million common shares of its stock to Landmark shareholders and the combined company would have between 18 million and 21 million shares outstanding upon completion of the merger, Magna said. Under the variable pricing structure of the original agreement, the recent trading prices of Magna's common stock would have resulted in an unacceptable level of intangible assets for the combined company, Magna said.

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain today proposed that a 35 nation summit this fall adopt a universal code of rights for Europe and North America. In a speech to Czechoslovakia's parliament the country's first democratically elected legislature in five decades she also urged that the 12 nation European Community offer full membership to Czechoslovakia and Eastern Europe's other new democracies as soon as they have introduced Western style economies. If we can create a great area of democracy stretching from the west coast of the United States right across to the Soviet Far East, that would give us the best guarantee of all for security because democracies don't go to war with each other, the British leader said.
