But several days of figure skating watching has convinced me that other factors come into play, including the nationalities of the judges and skaters involved. For instance, Anisette Torp Lind of Denmark did a perfectly lovely, and perfect, short program Wednesday. She placed eighth overall, but ranked 13th on the Japanese judge's chart, while this same lady gave the fallen Ms. Ito a third.

And last Saturday, in the men's final, the winner, Victor Petrenko of the United Team, had to place both hands on the ice to steady himself after a mishap, but scored higher than sixth place Kurt Browning of Canada, who needed but one hand to right himself after his bobble.

But he hasn't yet chosen an agent and won't make more endorsements until he does, says a spokesman for the U.S. Olympic Figure Skating Association. Moreover, while he has gotten one inquiry from a soft drink company, most requests so far are for public appearances rather than high paying product endorsements, industry executives say.

Say what you will about Goskomsport, the Soviet athletic apparat, it located young talent, nurtured it, clothed it, housed it, fed it steroids, and produced many of the greatest figure skaters the world has known. A few of them were almost too good. The legendary Irina Rodnina so dominated the sport in her day, winning 10 world championships and three Olympic gold medals from 1969 to 1980, that skaters from other countries grew discouraged and either retired early or turned pro.
