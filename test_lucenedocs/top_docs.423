PepsiCo Inc. is repositioning its caffeine free colas in hopes of jolting them out of their sales slump. The company will rename and repackage its brands in the style of Coca Cola Co.'s Caffeine Free Diet Coke, which dominates the market with about a 34% share and is the only caffeine free cola showing any significant growth. Now, the soft drinks will be called simply Caffeine Free Pepsi and Caffeine Free Diet Pepsi instead of Pepsi Free and Diet Pepsi Free, and the cans will have a gold background instead of the previous red.

Coca Cola Classic was tops in 1989, but the drink known as New Coke that was introduced to replace it in 1985 fell out of the annual Top 10 soft drink rankings for the first time, an industry newsletter says. The rankings released Wednesday by Beverage Digest indicated New Coke, which had tied with RC Cola and Caffeine Free Diet Pepsi for 10th place in 1988, failed to make the 10 top rankings this year. Publisher Jesse Meyers said Caffeine Free Diet Pepsi broke the tie this year, capturing 10th place with a 1.5 percent market share and leaving RC Cola and New Coke in a close fight for 11th at 1.4 percent each.

Industry experts say the percentage of soft drinks consumed in the morning has risen to 15 percent of all soda sales from 10 percent a decade ago, an important increase because each 1 percent share of the market represents more than $400 million in retail sales. Coffee consumption, meanwhile, has shown signs of declining, though it remains one of the prevalent wakeup beverages in the country. We think there is a lot of potential there to expand, Ms. Madeira said.

Pepsi spokesman Tod MacKenzie called the Coke II test an acknowledgement by Coke that Pepsi was a superior product. Whether it's Coke II or new new Coke, it's another validation of Coke's interest in the great taste of Pepsi, MacKenzie said from his office in Purchase, N.Y. This isn't the first time they've tried to imitate us, and it likely won't be the last, he said.

The opening bell has sounded in the 1988 summer cola fight, with Coca Cola Co. trying to KO a new Diet Pepsi commercial featuring boxer Mike Tyson. The ad is scheduled to premiere on television tonight just before Mr. Tyson and Michael Spinks duke it out in Atlantic City, N.J., for the heavyweight championship title. But Coke is furious about the commercial's claim that recently reformulated Diet Pepsi beat Diet Coke decisively in consumer taste tests.

No Pepsi, Coke, the order taker will be able to say, in a variation on the line that the late comedian John Belushi made famous years ago. Burger King Corp., the nation's second largest hamburger chain, said Tuesday it is switching to Coca Cola Co. as its official domestic soft drink supplier, ending an association that started in 1983 with Pepsi Cola Co. Miami based Burger King said Coca Cola products such as Coca Cola Classic, Diet Coke, Sprite and Minute Maid orange soda will replace Pepsi Cola's soft drink lineup in its restaurants over the next three months.

He called it Coca Cola, and a legend was born.

In 1985, Coca Cola took the extraordinary decision to abolish Coke in the US and replace it with the smoother, sweeter New Coke, which had consistently scored higher in blind tastings. The move was a disaster: the US public said changing the taste of Coke was like burning the American flag. Back came the old Coke, and it has been out selling every other soft drink since.

After conducting its own rather inexact blind taste test on magazine staffers, Consumer Reports found that only seven of 19 self proclaimed Coke or Pepsi fans could pick their preferred drink from unidentified samples. Diet sippers did worse, with only seven of 27 correctly identifying their preferred brand. But Consumer Reports also ran a more sophisticated study, testing 28 different cola types including the Big Two, Shasta, Royal Crown and store brands to gauge the relative taste quality of the products.

One way to do that, suggests Mr. Pirko, may be to to make an appeal based on taste particularly if beverage makers adopt new sweeteners in their diet drinks. That may occur as early as December 1992, when the patent on the artificial sweetener aspartame, held by NutraSweet, expires. It will kick a bunch of life into the diet category, predicts Mr. Pirko.

Coca Cola Co. is mounting an assault on that venerable office institution: the water cooler. Coke, naturally, would rather see employees gathering and gossiping around a Coca Cola dispenser. So the company is introducing a compact machine, called BreakMate, that chills water, carbonates it, mixes it with Coca Cola syrup and dispenses it into a 6 1/2 ounce cup.

When the caffeine intake was increased to 4{ to eight cups a day, the incidence of PMS rose nearly tenfold.

Paula W. Gold, state secretary of consumer affairs and business regulation, said Wednesday that both companies' tests were skewed by improper sampling techniques and did not fairly represent a random sample of cities across the nation.

A Coke spokesman says he knows of no such discussions, adding: There are no plans to market a clear Tab. The new Pepsi could lure people from new age drinks clear beverages, typically fruity and sold in bottles, with a wholesome air to them. Though a small category now, their sales are growing at about 4% to 6% a year, double the current rate of the traditional soft drink market.

The new Pepsi could lure people from new age drinks clear beverages, typically fruity and sold in bottles, with a wholesome air to them. Though a small category now, their sales are growing at about 4% to 6% a year, double the current rate of the traditional soft drink market. When someone pours a clear, new age drink in a glass, it looks natural, light and refreshing, attributes more appealing to an aging Baby Boom population, says Harold Taber, president of Hansen Beverage Co., a maker of natural soft drinks in Brea, Calif. At least, the new Pepsi could spark excitement in a soft drink market thirsting for new products.

Pepsi Cola Co. said Wednesday it had signed pop star Madonna for a global ad campaign that industry watchers said would chart virgin waters by debuting a song in a television commercial. Pepsi firing the latest volley in the newly escalating marketing war with Coca Cola Co. also will sponsor a planned world tour by the actress singer later in 1989 after the release of Madonna's first album in three years, Like A Prayer.

In its bid for more of the pre lunch market, Coke for the past three years has been running a Coke in the Morning ad campaign in certain areas. According to industry estimates, coffee accounts for 47% of the morning beverage market, followed by juice with 21%, milk at 17%, tea, 7% and soft drinks, only 4%.

The Pepsi convention seemed like an orchestrated attempt to rally overseas bottlers and to convince them once and for all that Pepsi is committed to the soda business abroad. Under the crush of Coke's global strength, some Pepsi international bottlers have felt neglected, particularly as PepsiCo has plunged hundreds of millions of dollars into building its snack and restaurant businesses abroad. The company even flew out D. Wayne Calloway, PepsiCo's chairman and chief executive officer, to address the troops.

Burger King Corp. is expected to announce today that its restaurants will continue to sell Pepsi Cola soft drinks, industry sources said. The renewal of the contract with Purchase, N.Y. based PepsiCo Inc. ends one of the year's hardest fought battles in the continuing cola wars between the soft drink giants PepsiCo and Atlanta based Coca Cola Co.
