Engineers opened floodgates wider Tuesday to release a record flow of water from a flood burdened reservoir, and some downstream residents who had not already evacuated called for help. Parts of Arkansas flooded since May 1 were declared a federal disaster area by President Bush as National Guardsmen labored to shore up a weakened levee protecting a small town from the Red River, which continued its steady climb toward a 45 year high. In neighboring Louisiana, residents stacked sandbags around homes near the Red River and some evacuated.
