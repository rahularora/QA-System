The Air Force is spending $90 million to rebuild a launch pad for its new Titan 4 rockets, which will take secret military payloads into space, an official said. Space Launch Complex 4 East has been used for Titan 34D launches since 1982 and was rebuilt after one exploded in April 1986. The Titan 4 will carry payloads previously intended for the space shuttle.

The Air Force's last Titan 3 rocket blasted off with a secret military satellite Monday, ending a quarter century of launches by a workhorse booster that has hurled more than 200 satellites into space. The 16 story tall rocket, the powerful 34D model, brilliantly illuminated the darkness as it blazed away from its launch pad at 1:54 a.m. The Air Force said it was the 135th success in 141 launches for the Titan 3 family, a success rate of 96 percent.

The Air Force awarded Martin Marietta Corp. a $1.56 billion contract for a new generation of Titan launch vehicles to lift a variety of military payloads into space. The award provides funds to accelerate production on an earlier Air Force order for 10 Titan 4 vehicles and also covers the purchase of 13 more under an Air Force program that envisions the new type of expendable vehicles as a complement to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's space shuttle launches. The Air Force has only four of the older Titan 34D models left after two successful launches last fall broke a long dry spell in U.S. space activities.

The nation's most powerful unmanned rocket failed to lift a secret military satellite into the proper orbit, effectively rendering it useless, according to a source close to the space program. Engineers were trying to determine whether they could salvage the satellite launched atop a 16 story Titan 34D Friday morning, the source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said late Friday night. However, the source was not hopeful anything could be done to place it in the correct orbit.

By today's standards, that first Titan 1 launch on Feb. 6, 1959, was not much. Only the first stage was fueled, with the second stage's tanks filled with water for weight, and it traveled only 300 miles down the Atlantic Tracking Range.

The Air Force has decided to convert a mothballed $3.5 billion space shuttle dock into a backup pad for launches of the Titan 4 Centaur rocket. The Pentagon said Friday the multimillion dollar conversion of Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base will start after Oct. 1. The first launch of Titan 4 rockets equipped with Centaur upper stage boosters at the pad is expected in 1996, the Pentagon said.

The Titan 4 will be the workhorse as the Pentagon assembles a stable of rockets to solve a post Challenger crisis that has left about 40 vital reconnaissance and other military payloads languishing in storage for want of a launch vehicle. The Titan 4 can hoist 39,000 pound payloads to an orbit 150 to 300 miles high or propel 10,000 pound packages to stationary orbits 23,000 miles up.

A secret new spy satellite circled the globe in a useless orbit Saturday, leaving the United States to continue relying on aging systems for eavesdropping and warning of missile attacks. The satellite, said to be designed for intercepting Soviet communications, was propelled into a successful preliminary orbit by a $65 million Titan 34D rocket launched here Friday. But a source close to the project said the spacecraft failed to achieve a desired stationary orbit 22,300 miles high when the upper stage of the rocket failed to re ignite.

A Titan 4, the workhorse rocket that will let the Pentagon reduce its dependence on the space shuttle, lifted into orbit what was believed to be a satellite capable of warning against missile attack. The 20 stories tall Titan, America's mightiest unmanned rocket, lit up NASA's two shuttle launch pads a few miles away one occupied by Atlantis, the other by Columbia as it headed out over the Atlantic on Monday night. The launch had been delayed two months by problems that included leaking propellant.

A Titan 2 rocket that once sat in a silo armed with a nuclear warhead was launched into space Monday, carrying a secret Air Force payload believed to be four spy satellites designed to eavesdrop on Soviet ships. The launch marked the first time one of the refurbished missiles had been used as a space booster, and apparently was the second time U.S. spy satellites had been sent into orbit in less than a week. It was a spectacular launch with all systems operating as expected, said Air Force Capt.

Gooch estimated that 40 space payloads have backed up, waiting for a rocket ride, as a result of the 32 month shuttle standdown after the shuttle accident and because of the grounding of the Titan 34D for several months after back to back failures in 1885 and 1986.

Chunks missing from a Titan 4 motor after a recent ground test could mean a delay in the first scheduled launch of the rocket in October, the San Jose Mercury News reported Wednesday. The test was conducted Feb. 14 at the San Jose research facilities of United Technologies Corp., whose engineers, along with Air Force specialists, are trying to find out if a flaw might require retesting or redesign, the newspaper said. U.S. space officials have been counting on the Titan 4 to carry into orbit dozens of satellites.

The United States doesn't need a super rocket and can rely on its fleet of expendable launch vehicles through the end of the century, a Defense Department advisory panel says. Instead of building a heavy lift booster, the Defense Science Board said, the military should push two technical approaches that hold promise for breakthroughs in rocket technology: the air breathing propulsion being developed for the National Aerospace Plane, and nuclear engines. Although launching rockets incorporating nuclear devices presents emotional and political difficulties, the task force review leads us to recommend continued investment in this area, said the report released Monday.

An advanced navigation satellite soared into orbit Tuesday aboard the maiden flight of the Air Force's new Delta 2 rocket, a booster developed to carry vital military payloads grounded after the space shuttle Challenger explosion. It was the first of at least 54 new unmanned rockets the Pentagon is ordering in a $14 billion program to resolve a post Challenger crisis that has seen about 40 needed reconnaissance and other national security payloads languish in storage for want of a launch vehicle. The Navstar Global Positioning System satellite carried on the Delta 2's maiden flight Tuesday was the first military payload shifted off the shuttle manifest to a throwaway booster.

On Monday, Payne called the Titan 2 liftoff a spectacular launch with all systems operating as expected, but said officials would not know for two to three days whether the payload achieved its intended polar orbit circling the Earth from North to South poles.

An advanced navigation satellite circled Earth today, boosted into orbit on the inaugural liftoff of the Delta 2, the first of the post Challenger space rockets developed to launch vital military payloads. It was in every way a picture perfect launch, Air Force Lt. Col. Bob Tayloe, the launch director, said after Tuesday's successful liftoff. The satellite came up very strong and we're receiving a good signal.

Aldridge, then undersecretary of the Air Force, sounded the warning before Congress in 1984.

High altitude winds forced a postponement Sunday of the launch the Air Force's new Delta 2 space rocket with an advanced navigation satellite. The postponement was announced just 13 minutes before the planned liftoff after balloon data showed that shear winds several miles above the launch pad were too high for the rocket to pass through safely. We have scrubbed the launch of the Navstar mission because of the upper level wind conditions, Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Force launch commentator reported.

With Titan we have a continuing production line with many Titans available so that if we should ever have a problem or an outage with the vehicle, we would still be able to recover and continue operations, he said.

Europe and the United States plan to send a space probe to Titan, the solar system's biggest moon and the only one with an atmosphere much like primordial Earth's, the European Space Agency announced Friday. The joint mission to Saturn's immense, gas shrouded satellite would begin in 1996 and include a lunar probe that may be able to test soil from the mysterious moon. The mission, to be called the Cassini Titan probe, was chosen from a series of proposed joint projects during meetings Thursday and Friday of the European Space Agency's Science Program Committee.

Space Shuttle Atlantis was moved to the launch pad Wednesday for a flight late this month in which the crew will deploy a Pentagon intelligence gathering satellite and try to determine man's role as a military observer in orbit. Perched vertically atop a huge transporter with a tank like tread, Atlantis headed out of an assembly building into the darkness shortly after 1 a.m., completing the snail's pace, four mile trip seven hours later at Launch Pad 39B. The move, befitting the classified nature of the mission, was made without the floodlights, music, speeches and cheers of thousands of workers who showed up when Discovery rolled to the pad July 4 for the first shuttle mission since the 1986 Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts.

But he added, risk oriented investors may wish to be aggressive in accumulating the stock since a normal Titan test would likely propel the stock to new heights.

The Air Force's powerful new Titan 4 rocket will carry a huge new missile warning satellite when it blasts off on its maiden flight next month, an industry magazine reported Friday. Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology said the 5,200 pound satellite is the third generation of Defense Support Program payloads designed to give the United States instant alert of a missile attack. The magazine said in a report to be published in its Feb. 20 issue that nine of the new DSP satellites, costing $180 million each, will be launched over the next several years.

McDonnell Douglas Corp. has suddenly become a major factor in the commercial space industry as a result of the Air Force's decision to order as many as 20 unmanned Delta II rockets. Industry officials say the economies of scale made possible by the Air Force purchase should give McDonnell Douglas a strong base for establishing a commercial launch business for space satellites. Its principal competitor will be European Ariane rockets, although two other U.S. companies said they may still try to enter the field.

But Alan Lovelace, a General Dynamics vice president, concedes that without a government contract to build its Atlas rockets, his company faces a difficult marketing challenge: It must line up customers one at a time in order to build an economic base that will allow it to go forward with production plans. We have a number of companies that have indicated a desire to make reservations with us, Mr. Lovelace says.
