Nations that fought in the Battle of Normandy will mark the 44th anniversary of D Day on Monday by opening a museum dedicated to world peace. Instead of rusty tanks and yellowing propaganda posters, the mammoth glass and stone memorial outside the city of Caen will house multi media exhibits that stress the lessons of World War II as much as the battle itself. The museum includes a research center with computerized access to war archives in France and overseas, a film and photography archive, and six exhibits that explain the development of the war from its origins in the post World War I period.

It was a lackluster performance and I later suspected that the Israelis put their rawest recruits on display as part of efforts to persuade the world, and the Arabs especially, that they were a weak country. Indeed, some influential military analysts were convinced of that and it may well have contributed to Arab overconfidence.

Regardless of which war it was or how many years have passed, the grunts the infantrymen who've fought in a war don't readily talk about it with those who've never been in one. A common reason: only other grunts can possibly understand what combat is like. It takes an uncommon interviewer to draw these men out, yet avoid a succession of war stories that become routine through repetition.

BFN <F P=106> [Interview with Serbian General Ratko Mladic by Valerio </F> Pellizzari in Belgrade; date not given: I, The War And Death Lord ] [Text] Belgrade Ratko Mladic is the true warlord in Bosnia. His artillery has shelled Knin, Sarajevo, Tuzla, and all the other towns with Muslim majorities without making any distinction between civil and military targets.

The appointment was on Belgrade's hills, far from the din of war. [Pellizzari] Why did you relentlessly shell Gorazde, a UN safe area? [Mladic] We attacked after the Muslims had attacked us for 15 days.
 FBIS4-55962 
[Pellizzari] Why did you relentlessly shell Gorazde, a UN safe area? [Mladic] We attacked after the Muslims had attacked us for 15 days. They were firing on our positions in an attempt to link up with the other safe areas which are under their control not to defend themselves, but in order to spread the war in Serbia and Montenegro.

[Mladic] We attacked after the Muslims had attacked us for 15 days.

[Pellizzari] The snipers were targeting children too, and the shells were falling on hospitals. [Mladic] You should have asked Izetbegovic these same questions two years ago, when they attacked our military hospital. Or in 1991, when the Croats were beheading women and children on the banks of the Korana river, or when they blew up Serbian homes with people still inside them, and then sang Thank You, Germany in German.

[Pellizzari] Why do you always prefer Russian Blue Helmets? Do they favor you? [Mladic] No, they are neutral.

 FBIS4-55962 
[Mladic] No, they are neutral. But a great country must intervene in this war in which all foreign countries are intervening. [Pellizzari] Tito, however, did not believe all that much in Slav brotherhood and in Russia's disinterested involvement in this area.

Just in time to serve as an antidote to the wave of sentimental reminiscence arising from the 50th anniversary of World War II, scholar Paul Fussell has written an angry book with this startling proposition: The whole truth about the war is still not known and never fully will be known because it is too horrible to tell. For the past 50 years the Allied war has been sanitized and romanticized almost beyond recognition by the sentimental, the loony patriotic, the ignorant and the bloodthirsty, writes Fussell. I have tried to balance the scales.

Joe Drodwill stood in cemetery overlooking the sea on Tuesday, remembering the fellow soldiers who fought and died there to free France from Nazi tyranny. It's like I'm reliving the war all over again, there are so many memories, said the war veteran from Middletown, Conn., who had not been back to the Normandy coast since the end of World War II. About 1,000 people gathered by the reflecting pool at the American military cemetery at Omaha Beach on Tuesday, the 45th anniversary of the invasion.

Scores of people wounded in nine days of war between Lebanon's main Christian armies are dying in hospitals that have no power and little blood, medicine or clean water, police said Wednesday. They said 365 people had been killed and 1,682 wounded since the battle for supremacy began Jan. 30 between nearly 20,000 soldiers commanded by rebel Gen. Michel Aoun and the Lebanese Forces militia of Samir Geagea, which has about 6,000 regulars and an estimated 30,000 reservists. Many of the victims have been civilians, some of them Moslems killed or wounded by shells that strayed out of Christian territory.

Aoun rejects the peace plan because it does not include a timetable for the withdrawal of the Syrian troops, and he refuses to recognize President Elias Hrawi, who was elected as part of the plan. Hrawi, Aoun and Geagea are Maronite Cathlics, the Christian sect that has dominated the government, army and judiciary since independence from France in 1943. Geagea recognizes Hrawi as president but has not taken a public position on the peace plan negotiated last fall at Taif, Saudi Arabia.

Since then, George Bush was elected president and the two congressmen who were bird dogging the Pentagon on the subject are gone: Rep. Mickey Leland, D Texas, died in a plane crash and Joseph DioGuardi, R N.Y., was defeated for re election. But the probe has not been scuttled, a Pentagon spokesman said last week.

Two Japanese men who fought for their country in World War II and then with Communist guerrillas for 45 years in the jungles of Malaysia returned to Japan today, saying they had looked forward to coming home the entire time. Shigeyuki Hashimoto, 71, and Kiyoaki Tanaka, 77, were greeted by a group of about 20 relatives and friends bearing flowers and candy at Tokyo's airport. It was their first time home since they left in 1944 to work in a wartime Japanese iron factory in Malaysia.

To ensure it does not finish off in the next few days what Operation Overlord began 50 years ago, France has just declared the remains of Hitler's Atlantic Wall defences an historic monument.

Mr Deskel knew King Abdallah, the grandfather of King Hussein who was assassinated in Jerusalem in 1952 by extremists opposed to his peace overtures towards Israel. Mr Rabin's preference for soldiers and relatives is at the expense of Israeli politicians. Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister who has done so much to make the Middle East peace process a success, was only invited by Mr Rabin to attend the summit at the last minute, reflecting a decades old personality and power conflict between the two men.

Early in 1947, when the 88th Infantry Division might have needed reinforcements for their near daily fire fights with the Yugoslavs in the Trieste area, the only combat units immediately available in Italy were three bands, stationed in Caserta, Rome and Livorno.

Your article brought back memories. My aunt, Ray Cowen Sawyer, was a Marine in World War I one of the first 50 women Marines in our history, I am told. She was assigned to collect sheet music for all of our military bands, and we have a treasured letter from Gen. Pershing thanking her for the good job she did.

The Marines never forget: When my aunt died, they sent an honor guard to her funeral.
