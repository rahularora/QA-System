CNN has decided to allow court transcripts of its Manuel Noriega prison tapes to be made public without further legal battles, the network and its attorney said Wednesday. U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler ruled Tuesday the transcripts could be released Thursday, unless CNN decided to take the case to a higher court. CNN has decided not to appeal, network attorney Terry Bienstock said, adding that CNN's primary concern had always been to protect its confidential source.

Some of Manuel Noriega's taped prison conversations were in code, including passages in which the deposed Panamanian dictator apparently discussed frozen funds, court transcripts show. Many of the conversations included in transcripts released by a federal judge Thursday dealt with family affairs, but some apparently involved money transfers and others showed Noriega followed Panamanian politics after he was ousted during a U.S. invasion in December 1989. Among the apparently coded calls was one by Noriega to the Cuban Embassy in Panama.

Cable News Network is asking the Supreme Court to let it broadcast tape recordings of deposed Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega's telephone conversations with his lawyers from his Florida jail cell. The justices today were awaiting responses from Noriega and the Bush administration to the emergency CNN request and are unlikely to act on the matter before next week. Meanwhile, the FBI said Thursday it had obtained CNN tapes in Atlanta and was checking whether they were recordings of Noriega.

In June, Hoeveler ordered prosecutors to unfreeze about $6 million in 27 Noriega linked bank accounts for use by the Noriega's private lawyers. But five months later, defense lawyers have not received a penny, and today they asked Hoeveler to light a fire under the U.S. government and banks in France, Switzerland and Austria, to release the funds. But Justice Department attorney Drew Arena told the judge that the foreign governments had frozen the accounts for their own investigations and have so far refused to release them despite the U.S. government's request.

An appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to lift the order, and CNN last week turned over the tapes it had obtained to Hoeveler for review. In Atlanta, CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said it was doubtful that CNN would broadcast any of the tapes today.

The case of the Manuel Noriega tapes casts a shadow over freedom of the press even though a federal judge lifted his order blocking their broadcast, a constitutional scholar says. U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler brought one legal battle between Noriega and Cable News Network to a close Wednesday when he lifted his 3 week old order barring CNN from airing tapes of the former dictator's jailhouse phone calls. Rodney Smolla, head of the Institute of Bill of Rights Law at William and Mary College in Williamsburg, Va., said he was disturbed that the U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene earlier to throw out the judge's order and that the high court will not get another chance to review the order.

A federal judge broadened the constitutional issues in the CNN Manuel Noriega tapes case Monday, saying basic fairness could allow him to block broadcast of the defendant's prison phone conversations. U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler cited fairness again in warning prosecutors to either persuade foreign governments to free $20 million in frozen Noriega linked bank accounts to pay defense lawyers, or appear before him for a hearing aimed at proving the money was drug tainted. I am deeply concerned about the image that this case seems to be acquiring that the defendant is not going to be able to get a fair trial, Hoeveler said.

On Nov. 8, U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler in Miami barred CNN from broadcasting at least some portions of the seven tapes it has until Hoeveler can determine whether the broadcasts would endanger Noriega's right to a fair trial by compromising privileged attorney client discussions. CNN has refused to hand over the tapes to Hoeveler. On Thursday, the network asked a U.S. Supreme Court justice, Anthony M. Kennedy, to let it broadcast the Noriega lawyer tapes.

When CNN continued its coverage of recorded telephone conversations of Manuel Noriega while appealing a federal judge's order in the case Thursday, a former judge read the story. Catherine Crier, a former Texas District Court judge, was one of several anchors telling viewers that CNN continued to broadcast its first report on the jailed Panamanian dictator because U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler's ruling would amount to unconstitutional prior restraint. Hoeveler issued a temporary injunction in Miami barring CNN from broadcasting parts of recordings of Noriega's conversations with his lawyers that could infringe on attorney client privilege.

MIAMI (A) A federal judge said today he has notified the U.S. attorney's office to represent him in criminal contempt proceedings against CNN for broadcasting Manuel Noriega's taped prison phone calls. Legal scholars have said a contempt hearing could provide a judicial test of whether the government can practice prior restraint on the news media. U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler eventually allowed Cable News Network to broadcast the audio tapes after ruling they did not violate Noriega's right to a fair trial.

CNN attorneys on Tuesday handed a federal magistrate a briefcase filled with tapes of Manuel Noriega's telephone calls, saying they were confident the recordings would show his rights were never violated. The network acted in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's weekend refusal to lift the trial judge's order that CNN cease broadcasting the tapes, and surrender them to determine if their use invaded Noriega's attorney client right to confidentiality. We hope and are confident that the court will conclude that the prior restraint is not appropriate under these circumstances, said Steven Korn, chief counsel to CNN's parent company, Turner Broadcasting System Inc.

A federal judge Wednesday lifted a ban on broadcasting tapes of Manuel Noriega's prison telephone calls, defusing a confrontation between the rights of the media and those of a criminal defendant. While CNN hailed the decision as a victory over censorship, Noriega's defense and constitutional specialists said the case showed the U.S. Supreme Court was willing to accept at least temporary restrictions on the press. U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler's decision ended a three week legal battle between Noriega and the network, which aired some of the tapes before the judge ordered CNN to stop.

CNN's tapes of Manuel Noriega's jailhouse phone calls to his legal team are in the hands of a federal magistrate who will help determine whether the former dictator's right to a fair trial has been jeopardized.

The network handed over a briefcase full of tapes on Tuesday after the U.S. Supreme Court refused over the weekend to lift U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler's temporary order barring CNN from airing the recordings. U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff will make and study transcripts and report to Hoeveler, who as the judge who will preside over Noriega's trial on drug trafficking charges will weigh a defense request to dismiss the case. Hoeveler assigned Turnoff to listen to the tapes to avoid being tainted by having learned details of Noriega's defense strategy.

He would not discuss their contents or origins but said he was confident that the judge will rescind his so called prior restraint on broadcast of the tapes. He said CNN believes it never violated the judge's order because the telecast conversations did not deal with matters protected by attorney client confidentiality in part because Rubino tacitly agreed to broadcasting them when he identified them on the air.

While the Atlanta based news channel now is seen in 84 countries, the best chance of catching CNN overseas is in a hotel room.

The Supreme Court refused by a 7 2 vote Sunday to give Cable News Network permission to broadcast tape recordings of conversations between Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega and his lawyers. The court rejected an emergency request by CNN that was aimed at lifting a federal judge's order forbidding the broadcasts until he could determine what the tapes disclose. The emergency request had called the Nov. 8 order by U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler in Miami an unconstitutional prior restraint of free speech.

The Supreme Court's handling of the CNN Noriega free press dispute creates a loophole for short lived gag orders against the news media. Although the court 14 years ago told judges they almost never may bar the reporting of information already in news media hands, Sunday's 7 2 vote left intact such a restraint against Cable News Network. The high court's action, however, was not unprecedented and may not have set any lasting rule of law.
