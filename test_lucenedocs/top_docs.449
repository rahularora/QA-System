A protective cage like those required on newer buses would not have prevented the fuel tank of a church bus from being punctured in a fiery crash that claimed 27 lives, the state fire marshal says. Fire Marshal Bill Martin said the location of a three inch gash on the front of the 60 gallon tank and pictures of the metal cages required in newer buses had convinced him that whatever pierced the tank probably would have passed between the bars of a cage. In this situation, the way this accident occurred, that cage would have had little or no effect, Martin said in an interview Thursday.

The crash and fire that killed 27 people on a church bus probably would not have been prevented by a protective cage around the vehicle's fuel tank, a state fire marshal reported Tuesday. After examining fuel tank cages on other buses, investigators concluded the protective cage is to prevent the tank from being torn away during collision and not to protect it against puncture, the report said. The report confirmed that the fire which engulfed the bus owned by Radcliff First Assembly of God church was caused by gasoline gushing from a puncture, 2{ to 3 inches long, in the fuel tank.

The humane society has prodded the U.S. Department of Agriculture into investigating complaints that a Soviet circus tour that went bust left some animals cooped up in undersized cages. Bears, chimpanzees and dogs from the Great Circus Bim Bom are barely able to move in their cages in Newburgh, N.Y., according to Lisa Landres, an investigator with the Humane Society of the United States. So on Thursday the group's regional office in Flanders, N.J., asked the government to look into the case, she said.

Before the bus accident that left 27 people dead of smoke inhalation, federal safety officials were confident that riders would have enough time to escape a burning bus before it was engulfed by flames, a top official testified Wednesday. Up until May 14 of this year, we were patting ourselves on the back for the good job we had done, said Ralph Hitchcock, director of the office of vehicle safety standards for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Now we're reviewing all of our standards for bus safety.

Battery cages cause extreme suffering to egg laying hens, a government adviser on animal health has found after a wide ranging review of scientific evidence. Mr Mike Baxter, director of Brunel University's Design Centre, concluded that hens suffer in a number of ways by not being able to perform natural functions in very small cages. His report, published today, is likely to add to pressure on the government to restrict battery farming.

When her husband suggested the family could use more cash, Janice Henke got herself a job trapping skunks. When I come in from an unsuccessful skunk expedition, my husband won't let me come in the house unless I take off every stitch, including my sneakers, and hang them in the tree, says Mrs. Henke, who lives far enough outside of Glens Falls, N.Y., that there are no neighbors nearby. Then it's into a shower and I leave my clothes outside for a week or so.

Feinberg was standing in the keeper's area of the cage when the attack occurred.

Federal indictments unsealed Friday charged 170 people as members of a huge, international drug ring linked to Panama's Manuel Noriega that dealt in more than $1 billion worth of marijuana and cocaine. Noriega was not charged in the indictments, which disclosed that that the Panamanian strongman allegedly laundered profits from the sale of marijuana shipped to a Louisiana shipyard. This organization is sophisticated, well orchestrated and rivals any multinational corporation, U.S. Attorney Joe Cage said.

BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) Hundreds of mice, rats and hamsters used for research were released from their cages at the state University of New York at Buffalo Medical School, but no animal rights group claimed responsibility. The animals were found scampering around five rooms Saturday morning by a technician arriving for work, said school spokeswoman Linda Grace Kobas. They opened the cages, and the mice and the rats (and hamsters) got out of the cages, but they did not escape from the rooms, she said.

A dog left alone for several hours can become mighty bored. It is much safer for a bored dog to be in an enclosed space (like a baby in a playpen) than roaming around a house or apartment chewing through electrical cords, getting into the trash, pulling down draperies and curtains, and gnawing at the furniture. The kennel may sound cruel but it is by far the better alternative.
