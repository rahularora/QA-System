It was a sentimental moment for country's top entertainer Hank Williams Jr., the rowdy Southerner notorious for wild party songs, when he upstaged Alabama's artist of the decade proclamation. It appeared to be Alabama's night early during Monday night's 24th annual Academy of Country Music Awards presentations as the country rockers joined Marty Robbins and Loretta Lynn in the prestigious artist of the decade ranks. The band has won 13 ACM trophies since 1982, and has had 21 consecutive No.

An investor who says he's acting on behalf of disgruntled preferred stockholders of Chicago Milwaukee Corp. said the group plans to call for a special election to replace two new directors. Robert J. Rosan, a lawyer here and a preferred holder, said he sent a letter to the Chicago based holding company asking it to cooperate with our intended solicitation of proxies for such an election. He said the group owns more than 20% of the preferred shares, but that he expects that percentage to grow as other preferred holders respond to a separate letter asking them for support.
