According to an opinion poll, most Americans do not know where Holland is but they can easily tell you where tulips come from. Perhaps fewer Americans know the extraordinary history of this bloom, once prized above the riches of princes, now produced for the millions, yet still touched by the magic of its exotic past. Tulip bulbs saved many of the Dutch from death in the darkest years of Nazi occupation, and they have helped to keep them prosperous ever since.

Tulip bulbs saved many of the Dutch from death in the darkest years of Nazi occupation, and they have helped to keep them prosperous ever since. It is understandable that the Netherlands wants to celebrate; it has chosen 1994 as the 400th anniversary of the flowering of tulips flowered in the Dutch province of Holland (no matter that the date is doubtful) and is marking the event with pageants, tours, an exhibition at the Frans Hals Museum in Haarlem and one in the autumn at Amsterdam's Nieuwe Kirche, adorned with unseasonal 'ice tulips'.

The centerpiece of Holland's flower fields is the Keukenhof Gardens, a 70 acre private park outside the charming town of Lisse, about 30 minutes outside Amsterdam. ; Open to the public for six weeks each spring, Keukenhof has some six million bulbs, some bursting into rare or unusually colored tulips, hyacinths, dahlias, daffodils, crocuses, irises and gladioluses. ; The 42nd annual exhibition takes place March 28 to May 20 this year.

All year, tulip growers have been celebrating the 400th anniversary of the tulip's first flowering in Holland; today, we celebrate its birthday with theological correctness as a chapter in the history Mammon Within 40 years of the tulip's first flowering, people were already speculating in it madly. Instead of planting it, they bought tulip futures, sold them to the next man and left the bother of delivery and gardening to the last mutt in the chain. Perhaps we should reintroduce them for non gardening readers in the winter.

Nowadays, I cannot find this old fashioned bulb fibre in general stores: what they sell under that name is simply peat, recycled under a seasonal label. I have now given up and simply use earth from the garden into which I mix a very small dose of water retention crystals. Prepare the soil in a separate container by watering it, mixing in the crystals like ground almonds into a Mediterranean cake: then, wet the mixture lightly in order to activate the jelly.

Follow the usual rules: put the bowls in a dark, unheated cupboard or frost proof shed where they can develop roots; the crystals should mean there will be no need for more water.

My lesson here is extremely simple: wallflowers are shallow rooted and can be grown in groups between the dormant plants of your main borders without detracting from their later seasons.
