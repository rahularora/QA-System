A team of scientists is going on a Mount McKinley expedition to determine among other things: How high is high? The team from the School of Engineering at the University of Alaska Anchorage will carry sophisticated measuring equipment up North America's tallest peak. With the help of a satellite, the equipment will try to re measure the height of Alaska's most popular attraction, currently recorded at 20,320 feet.

Mount McKinley still is North America's tallest mountain, but it is not as tall as people have been saying for years. Using extremely sensitive gravity meters and satellites, scientists from the University of Alaska Anchorage have determined the mountain is 20,306 feet high. That's 14 feet less than what Bradford Washburn calculated in 1954.

The scientists say that because of its great mass, McKinley exerts enough gravitational pull to distort standard surveying techniques like those used by Washburn to calculate the mountain's height.

A sled dog lost in poor weather during a climbing expedition on Mount McKinley has turned up, weak but alive, after 18 days on the ice covered mountain. Patricia and Jean Francois Tuveri of Chamonix, France, assumed the dog had fallen in a crevasse and died after it disappeared May 31. The Tuveris had four dogs in harness when they started mushing up North America's tallest peak.

A Mount McKinley climbing party of three Japanese men is presumed dead 3,000 feet below the summit of North America's tallest peak, the National Park Service said Saturday.

Climbers from China, Japan and Nepal who staged a successful rendezvous on Mount Everest's summit were making progress today in descending the world's tallest peak, the expedition's leader said. When nine of the climbers met on top of the world Thursday, they achieved two mountaineering firsts: simultaneously scaling Everest from two sides and making a live telecast from the summit. Three other expedition members later reached the summit.

On Everest there are two seasons before and after the monsoon which breaks in June, so climbers are tackling the mountain in May or October, said Band, who was in Hillary's 1953 expedition. He added that worst problem was increased numbers of Sherpas cooking with firewood and depleting the shrubbery, which could cause erosion. Hillary said that because hundreds have climbed Everest we can't feel sorry for those who may not get the opportunity over the next few years.

A new expedition led by the first man to conquer Mount McKinley alone in winter ended less than 1,000 feet from the top when one climber apparently froze to death and three others suffered hypothermia. Lynn Salerno, 31, died early Wednesday at the 19,500 foot level of North America's highest peak, the National Park Service said. Two other members of the nine person expedition were evacuated by helicopter.

The National Park Service requested help from the Army as fears mounted that three Japanese climbers trying to make a winter ascent of Mount McKinley were near death somewhere near the summit. The Park Service on Tuesday said little can be done until hurricane force winds buffeting the 20,320 foot peak abate. The climbers have not been heard from in more than a week and are believed to have run out of food six days ago, said John Quinley, a park service spokesman.

Hurricane force winds that have hampered the search for three missing Japanese climbers on Mount McKinley abated somewhat Friday, and an Air Force pilot saw a flash of red or orange as he flew near the continent's tallest peak. Maj. Neal Sharra radioed, however, that he saw no movement in the area along the missing men's likely route, and officials cautioned the color might be a box of emergency provisions left for climbers in trouble. The three climbers, who were last seen Feb. 22 while attempting a rare wintertime ascent of the 20,320 mountain, are equipped with orange tents and were wearing identical red climbing suits.

Sequoia celebrates its centennial Tuesday as the second oldest national park with its superintendent hoping the home of the world's biggest trees will be even better 100 years from now. A 13,255 foot mountain, one of thousands in the Sierra Nevada range that forms California's spine, will be named Centennial peak during a brief ceremony honoring both Sequoia and its slightly younger cousin, Kings Canyon National Park. However, most of the celebration was on Sunday when people were invited to visit the adjacent parks free and learn about their history and future.

Hillary, now 68, now spends much of his time behind desks in the capitals of India, Nepal and Bangladesh as New Zealand's ambassador to all three countries.

They're staking their futures on the flood of tourists coming to see the only active volcano in the contiguous United States. More than a million visitors each year drive to viewpoints or stop at a Forest Service visitor center 30 miles from the volcano. Almost 50,000 have climbed the volcano's south side since entry restrictions were eased in 1987.

Add one more issue to the list of conundrums Congress will have to unravel when it returns from its summer recess next month: whether the tallest mountain in North America should be renamed. It's a perennial duel between an Ohio congressman protecting the honor of William McKinley, the 25th U.S. president after whom the peak is named, and an Alaska senator defending his state's right to name its own land features. The motives of Sen. Ted Stevens, R Alaska, are easy to discern.

Magellan has used radar to peer through clouds and map 18 percent of Venus' landscape, comparable to an area on Earth stretching from Los Angeles to Reykjavik, Iceland, and covering most of North and South America.

The first American to scale Mount Everest is planning another assault 26 years later, this time with a trash bag on his back and Soviet and Chinese colleagues at his side. Jim Whittaker is leading the three nation Peace Climb to celebrate world peace and mark the 20th anniversary of Earth Day. The 30 person expedition will clean decades of discarded oxygen bottles and other debris left by previous climbers, he said.

Communist guerrillas said Saturday they captured eight mountain climbers, including three foreigners, on the country's tallest peak to check if any were military informants. The Menardo Arce Command, a guerrilla unit of the Communist New People's Army operating in southern Mindanao, said they also detained the climbers also to protect them from rebel mines. But they said the three foreigners and the five Filipinos, captured Tuesday, will be released soon because interrogation showed they were not spies.

Mountain climbers may suffer impaired judgment because they don't sleep well, according to a study of six people who simulated climbing Mount Everest by living 40 days in a low pressure chamber. People have known for a long time that sleep at high altitudes is poor. We found sleep at high altitudes is so poor that little restorative effect can be expected, Dr. James D. Anholm said in a summary of his study.
