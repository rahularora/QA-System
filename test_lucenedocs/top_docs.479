About 10% of the callers, as many as 100 on some days, spoke only foreign languages, mostly Spanish and Vietnamese.

<P> Baffled that their telephone bills seemed astronomical in past months, many Vietnamese students enrolled in a job training program for Southeast Asians in San Diego have been showing their bills to their English speaking instructors in hopes of getting an explanation. </P> <P> We knew they shouldn't have such huge phone bills, said Beverley Yip, director of the Union of Pan Asian Communities, a San Diego based support group that provides job training. The students were being billed for things like call waiting and call forwarding a whole package that they didn't need or want.

<P> Thousands of Pacific Bell's rural customers are expected to share about $5 million in refunds this summer under a quietly negotiated tentative settlement of a complaint accusing the company of charging customers for push button telephone service that it never provided. </P> <P> The California Public Utilities Commission approved the proposed settlement in secret session on Friday but issued no press release, apparently at Pacific Bell's request. The action comes less than three years after the PUC ordered the phone company to refund millions of dollars to customers pressured into buying services that they neither needed nor wanted.

Allowing competition for intraLATA calling would bring about lower prices, increased consumer choice, and a wealth of new services and technology to the public. ; Recently, Pacific Bell and GTE California requested California Public Utilities Commission approval to increase the rates they charge for basic local telephone service (the flat charge to provide service to your home or business), coupled with reductions in their intraLATA toll rates. PacBell and GTE say these changes are necessary because of the anticipated pricing pressure that will be brought about by competition in the LATAs.

But Bell executives are still promising a battle over the bill's rules for allowing them into the cable television market while cable companies are allowed into the local telephone market.

GTE of California also provides phone service to Cerritos.

A federal appeals court Wednesday gave states the authority to regulate new telephone services such as voice mail and computer access, a move one Baby Bell company said could raise costs to consumers. The decision could force the seven regional Bell telephone companies to set up separate corporate entities to handle their regulated telephone services and their newer, unregulated services, officials said. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals opinion vacated a 1985 Federal Communications Commission rule that had required the Baby Bells to keep finances separate for regulated and unregulated services but not create separate corporations.

BELL ATLANTIC, the large east coast telecommunications company, yesterday won an important legal victory which could make it the first US local telephone company offering cable television in its telephone service area. It said a US district court in Alexandria, Virginia, had declared unconstitutional a provision in the 1984 Cable Act blocking telephone companies from providing cable programming in areas where they also provide a telephone service. US local telephone companies, which are keen to enter the potentially lucrative cable business, have lobbied Congress for years to have the ban removed.

Such an approach would eventually mean that customers would have a choice between two integrated fixed link operators, instead of facing monopoly suppliers for two separate services. Further competition will be provided by operators offering television and telephone services via satellite and radio links. Restructuring the industry in this way will have considerable benefits for customers.

John D. Goeken filed a lawsuit Wednesday against GTE Corp., one day after he resigned as chief executive of the Airfone subsidiary he founded. Goeken's lawsuit, filed in DuPage County court, contends GTE breached his employment contract at Airfone, which provides air to ground telephone service to airline passengers. Goeken said in a statement he plans to file a competing application for air to ground telephone service with the Federal Communications Commission once the Airfone case is resolved.

PACIFIC Bell, the telephone company serving California, yesterday announced plans to spend Dollars 16bn over seven years to create a multi media communications super highway across its territory. It also awarded American Telephone &amp; Telegraph a contract estimated at some Dollars 5bn to supply key parts for the system. The project is among the largest network modernisations announced by a local US telecommunications group as both these companies and cable television operators start to pour capital into the creation of inter active, multi media communications networks.
