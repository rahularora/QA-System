Dow Chemical Co. said Friday it decided to keep its middle name as well as the first and last after a six month study concluded the company shouldn't change its 92 year old identity. Dow's president and chief executive officer, Frank Popoff, said an internal committee and an outside consultant looked into changing the corporate identity for more than six months before recommending against any change. Company spokesman Tom Henderson said he did not know how much the study cost.

Just off a red clay track beside the sparkling Tchepone River is the reborn hamlet of Ban Dong Nai, which American bombers pounded into oblivion a generation ago. Today, the villagers smile and welcome foreign visitors, but the older ones still wonder what they did to deserve the terror that rained from the skies between 1964 and 1973. American planes attacked Ban Dong Nai during the Indochina war because the clay track was part of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the network of jungle paths through eastern Laos and Cambodia used by communist North Vietnam to move men and supplies into U.S. backed South Vietnam.

There was no way to independently verify rebel or government claims because transportation and telephone services to the region were cut off. But travelers reaching Vavuniya, just south of Jaffna, confirmed that the Jaffna was being heavily bombed. Over the weekend, air force planes dropped leaflets warning the city's 120,000 residents to evacuate.

ON A crisp April morning, under a clear blue sky, Midland Michigan seems like the most pristine place on earth. Walking past the daffodils and crocuses in Dow Gardens, just down the road from the Dow funded arts centre, it is hard to believe that one of the world's biggest chemical plants is just a mile away. Spring is a good time to visit Midland.

Captors holding U.S. hostages in Lebanon are motivated by a personal vengeance that will be more difficult to overcome since Israel kidnapped a Moslem cleric, says a U.S. Moslem leader who claims to have met with the hostage holders in Beirut. Mohammed Mehdi, secretary general of the National Council on Islamic Affairs, said Thursday the kidnapping of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid worsened the prospects that the exceptionally bitter, exceptionally paranoid kidnappers will free the hostages. They feel the right to retaliation is sacred, and any questioning of that is illegitimate, said Mehdi, who claims to be possibly the only person in the United States who has met with the kidnappers in Beirut.

American allegations that Iraq is using outlawed chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels have touched off a wave of anti Americanism in Iraq. But although the conflict may damage U.S. Iraqi relations, there appears little likelihood of a return to the bitter hostility that made Iraq a leading foe of U.S. Middle East policies in the 1970s. The U.S. Senate on Sept. 9 accused Iraq of using poison gas in a campaign of genocide against its autonomy seeking Kurdish minority.

Kenneth Wenker, professor of philosophy at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, says there has been a subtle shift of emphasis across the curriculum to emphasize ethics. ; When presented with an ethical or moral dilemma, there's a tendency to have a knee jerk reaction and declare a situation all black or all white, Wenker says. But with some training, people learn to deal with ambiguity.

Both Frank and I had a lot of international experience and I think, for a company that has over 50% of its sales outside (the U.S.), that's very important, Mr. Oreffice said. Dow is increasing its business abroad; one sign of the company's increasingly international outlook is the fact that four of its 17 board members are foreign born, including Mr. Oreffice, born in Italy, and Mr. Popoff, born in Bulgaria. Mr. Popoff's previous positions with Dow include stints as general manager of the agricultural and organic chemicals department of Dow Chemical U.S.A. and vice president, marketing and sales, for Dow Chemical Europe.

American presidents sometimes act out of character when occasion demands. Harry Truman, suspected of isolationism, launched the Marshall Plan and Nato to put war shattered Europe back on its feet; Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, cold war warriors both, opened improbable avenues of co operation and communication with China and the former Soviet Union respectively. By these historical standards, there is something both consistent and logical in Bill Clinton's drawing of a line under the Vietnam War by his decision last night to end the trade embargo.
