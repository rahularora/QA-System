A secret 1949 experiment at the Hanford nuclear reservation released about twice as much radioactive gas as scientists had predicted beforehand, according to a newly declassified report. The report said the so called Green Run experiment released about 7,780 curies of radioactive iodine and about 20,000 curies of xenon 133, a gas. By contrast, the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, the worst commercial nuclear accident in the United States, emitted 15 to 24 curies of radioactive iodine into the Pennsylvania countryside.

Disposal of eight old, closed reactors that produced plutonium fuel for the nation's nuclear weapons could cost $217 million and take more than 100 years, according to a draft plan released Thursday. The pioneering reactors, some of which date back to the Manhattan Project during World War II, are on the Hanford federal nuclear reservation in south central Washington and have been idled for years. No future long term use of any of the eight surplus production reactors has been identified by the DOE, said the draft environmental impact statement by the Department of Energy.

The message said, according to Soviet authorities, the release of radioactivity was far less than the 1.5 million curies reported in earlier press accounts.

Greenpeace asked the Soviet Union on Monday to seek world help to recover from the bottom of the Norwegian Sea, one mile down, a wrecked submarine and its two nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. A technical report commissioned by the environmental organization said the Soviet submarine on April 7 took a significant amount of highly active and toxic radioactive materials to the bottom, 5,296 feet beneath the surface. If the submarine is not recovered intact then it is, in our opinion, inevitable that all of this material will disperse to the marine environment, said the report by the independent nuclear engineering consultants John Large and Associates Ltd. of London.

Energy Secretary James Watkins said Wednesday a nuclear weapons plant in the Pacific Northwest released enough radiation in the 1940s to pose a serious health hazard to nearby residents. It was the first time the government has acknowledged that radiation emissions from the Hanford Nuclear Reservation were high enough to cause illnesses, incluuding cancer, in people living nearby. Watkins, speaking in advance of a study on the Richland, Wash., plant to be released Thursday, said, The implications of the report are serious.

For fourteen years up until 1969 Japan was dumping medical use radioactive isotopes and other such radioactive waste into the open sea, but since then has not been doing so.

The organization of dumping wastes at sea stipulated the reduction to a minimum of the possible unfavorable impact of the wastes on the population as a whole and on the critical group of the population who reside in coastal areas. During the resolution of organized issues of waste dumping at sea, a policy was also conducted toward the reduction of the possible unfavorable impact of the wastes on the environment.

At the international conference of experts on the assessment of the existing and potential consequences of dumping radioactive wastes in Arctic waters that took place in Oslo in February 1993 in which the representatives of 12 countries and also IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] experts participated, based on the materials examined, they arrived at the conclusion that there is inadequate evidence of a dangerous impact of sources of radioactive contamination on the maritime environment of the Arctic Seas at the present time, except for the entry of radioactive wastes from Western European spent nuclear fuel reprocessing plants and global fallout of the products of nuclear detonations. An expeditionary study of waste dumping areas in the Karsk Sea was conducted on the Kovrayskiy OIS [Experimental Research Ship] to assess the impact of radioactive wastes on the naval environment during the period from 16 August through 10 September 1993.

There is no evidence to show that underground nuclear tests in Nevada jeopardize the health of nearby residents, although radioactive materials have periodically been released by the blasts, a congressional study concludes. The report by Congress' Office of Technology Assessment said that since 1970 the underground tests have released about 54,000 curies of radiation, an amount the study said would give a resident living near the test site all that time about the same exposure to radiation as a single X ray. The report, released this week, said there is no need to improve radiation containment procedures in connection with the tests, but it suggested that the government abandon its practice of keeping such tests secret.

Corrosion of the nuclear reactor aboard a Soviet submarine that sank off Norway April 7 may eventually lead to the release of huge amounts of radioactivity, the environmental group Greenpeace said Tuesday. The group said a study done for it by John Large and Associates, a nuclear engineering consulting firm in London, concluded that the submarine may release up to 20 million curies of radioactivity if the vessel is not recovered. That is equal to about one third of the radiation released by the April 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Soviet Ukraine, Greenpeace said.

RUSSIA has admitted the Soviet navy sank nuclear submarines and radioactive materials in its northern seas. An official report seen by the Financial Times paints a chilling picture of secret pollution which began in 1959. The report, drawing on KGB and military documents declassified on the orders of President Boris Yeltsin, was drawn up after a ship from Greenpeace, the environmentalist organisation, was seized by the Russian navy for trying to measure the radioactivity last October.

Officials spent Saturday laboriously trying to track down truck drivers, warehouse workers and others who may have been exposed to an intensely radioactive pellet buried within a transcontinental cargo shipment. The radioactive pellet the size of a pencil eraser was discovered Thursday lying loose in a shipment of what were supposed to have been empty containers trucked to Massachusetts. The pellet, called a source, is used for making X ray type pictures of welds, structural steel and other industrial objects.

Speaking at a press conference here today, he told home and foreign reporters that the South Korean authorities dumped 29,513 curies of liquid waste, 84,737 curies of gas waste and 29,034 drums of solid waste in seven years from 1986 to 1992. He ascribed their dumping of a large amount of nuclear waste in the sea to their anti popular policy, the backwardness of the technological levels of atomic energy facilities and, especially, their clandestine promotion of nuclear arms development.

Karachay Lake, a 100 acre body of water in the Soviet Union, could be the most polluted spot on the planet, the result of years of radioactive waste dumping, according to a published report today. U.S. experts who recently visited a Soviet nuclear weapons production complex found extremely high levels of radioactive contamination and a history of high doses to production workers, The New York Times reported. The Soviets have confirmed that in 1951, atomic bomb makers began pumping radioactive wastes into Karachay Lake about 900 miles east of Moscow a practice that continued until the accumulation reached 120 million curies.

Twenty gallons of heavy water spilled at the Savannah River nuclear weapons plant Wednesday, sending a plume of radioactive tritium into the air, but there was no threat to workers or area residents, officials said. Two workers at the Savannah River Site who were splashed with the water received small doses of radidation, about the equivalent of half a chest X ray, officials said. Crews were unable to detect radioactivity at the plant or along its boundaries, said Dennis Stevenson, manager of health protection operations for Westinghouse Savannah River Co., which operates the plant for the U.S. Department of Energy.

; Redefining U.S. national security without the Soviet threat as its organizing principle is proving to be difficult. ; We have no consensus yet on what our essential interests are, and threats without enemies behind them don't seem very threatening. As the national debate proceeds, we may find that we have something to learn from the Russians, though it comes at a tragic cost to them and possibly to the world.

There is a potentially explosive witches' brew cooking inside 177 nuclear waste storage tanks at the Hanford nuclear reservation. Surrounded by steel and concrete, buried under several feet of earth, and roasting at temperatures of 140 degrees, the radioactive slurry changes in ways that scientists cannot always predict. Scientists working for the U.S. Department of Energy concluded that hydrogen gas trapped beneath the hard crust of the waste in 20 of the tanks could explode, releasing up to 3 million curies of radiation from a single tank.

Safety improvements are needed to help prevent accidents and protect operators at the Department of Energy's five test and research reactors, the National Academy of Sciences said Thursday. A report issued by the National Research Council, the academy's operating arm, said DOE currently lacks a clear conceptual framework for addressing safety issues at the reactors. It said that because most of the reactors were designed many years ago and since have been modified to operate at higher power levels, prevention and mitigation of some potential accidents rely heavily on the proper and timely response of reactor operators.

I came to the president's administration to work as an adviser and I hope that I will be able to do some real work.

I came to the president's administration to work as an adviser and I hope that I will be able to do some real work. And up until this spring I had not been disappointed.
 FBIS3-22191 
I came to the president's administration to work as an adviser and I hope that I will be able to do some real work. And up until this spring I had not been disappointed. Shevelev: And what happened in the spring?
 FBIS3-22191 
And up until this spring I had not been disappointed. Shevelev: And what happened in the spring? Yablokov: I saw that I had no support behind me.
 FBIS3-22191 
Shevelev: And what happened in the spring? Yablokov: I saw that I had no support behind me. The ministry of environmental protection came out in support of the program for the development of atomic energy.
 FBIS3-22191 
Yablokov: I saw that I had no support behind me. The ministry of environmental protection came out in support of the program for the development of atomic energy. I said that it could not be adopted without an expert ecological evaluation, but in the cabinet meeting I was supported only by Minister of Justice Nikolay Fedorov.

The ministry of environmental protection came out in support of the program for the development of atomic energy. I said that it could not be adopted without an expert ecological evaluation, but in the cabinet meeting I was supported only by Minister of Justice Nikolay Fedorov. There are some things that cannot be done, there is a limit to compromise.

I said that it could not be adopted without an expert ecological evaluation, but in the cabinet meeting I was supported only by Minister of Justice Nikolay Fedorov. There are some things that cannot be done, there is a limit to compromise. Shevelev: Does the problem lie only in your disagreements with the minister of environmental protection?
 FBIS3-22191 
There are some things that cannot be done, there is a limit to compromise. Shevelev: Does the problem lie only in your disagreements with the minister of environmental protection? Yablokov: I think that what happened with him, the fact that he was not able to resist bureaucratic pressure, says something about the entire government.
 FBIS3-22191 
Shevelev: Does the problem lie only in your disagreements with the minister of environmental protection? Yablokov: I think that what happened with him, the fact that he was not able to resist bureaucratic pressure, says something about the entire government. Is this really the government we dreamed about when Gaydar and Burbulis came?
 FBIS3-22191 
Yablokov: I think that what happened with him, the fact that he was not able to resist bureaucratic pressure, says something about the entire government. Is this really the government we dreamed about when Gaydar and Burbulis came? Did we need eight or nine deputy prime ministers with duplicate functions?
 FBIS3-22191 
Is this really the government we dreamed about when Gaydar and Burbulis came? Did we need eight or nine deputy prime ministers with duplicate functions? Did it not turn out to be uncontrollable?...
 FBIS3-22191 
Did we need eight or nine deputy prime ministers with duplicate functions? Did it not turn out to be uncontrollable?... Shevelev: Aleksey Vladimirovich, you are speaking as a person who intends to retire.
 FBIS3-22191 
Did it not turn out to be uncontrollable?... Shevelev: Aleksey Vladimirovich, you are speaking as a person who intends to retire. Yablokov: I intend to leave.
 FBIS3-22191 
Shevelev: Aleksey Vladimirovich, you are speaking as a person who intends to retire. Yablokov: I intend to leave. Rather, I am thinking about it very hard...in the spring when I understood that I would not be able to get through the Council of Ministers I suggested raising these issues at the Security Council.
 FBIS3-22191 
Yablokov: I intend to leave. Rather, I am thinking about it very hard...in the spring when I understood that I would not be able to get through the Council of Ministers I suggested raising these issues at the Security Council. For now an interdepartmental commission on questions of ecology has been created.

For now an interdepartmental commission on questions of ecology has been created. If nothing happens here.... Shevelev: Raise questions, interdepartmental commission this does not sound very inspiring.... Yablokov: This is my last chance. Let us look.
 FBIS3-22191 
If nothing happens here.... Shevelev: Raise questions, interdepartmental commission this does not sound very inspiring.... Yablokov: This is my last chance. Let us look. Yesterday, for example, at this commission they discussed what to do with the submarine Komsomolets.

Let us look. Yesterday, for example, at this commission they discussed what to do with the submarine Komsomolets. The direst predictions from four years ago are coming true.

Yesterday, for example, at this commission they discussed what to do with the submarine Komsomolets. The direst predictions from four years ago are coming true. The plutonium has turned into a mushy mass and only the beryllium lining is keeping it from spilling out.
 FBIS3-22191 
The direst predictions from four years ago are coming true. The plutonium has turned into a mushy mass and only the beryllium lining is keeping it from spilling out. Shevelev: How long, in your opinion, will it hold out?
 FBIS3-22191 
The plutonium has turned into a mushy mass and only the beryllium lining is keeping it from spilling out. Shevelev: How long, in your opinion, will it hold out? Yablokov: A year.
 FBIS3-22191 
Shevelev: How long, in your opinion, will it hold out? Yablokov: A year. Shevelev: And what did your interdepartmental commission decide to do?
 FBIS3-22191 
Yablokov: A year. Shevelev: And what did your interdepartmental commission decide to do? Yablokov: There were voices that said we should not get upset.
 FBIS3-22191 
Shevelev: And what did your interdepartmental commission decide to do? Yablokov: There were voices that said we should not get upset. But when it came to the question of who would sign such a decision not to do anything there were none who were willing.
 FBIS3-22191 
Yablokov: There were voices that said we should not get upset. But when it came to the question of who would sign such a decision not to do anything there were none who were willing. We will spend money now because otherwise, if the plutonium starts leaking, we will spend 10 times as much on fines alone.

But when it came to the question of who would sign such a decision not to do anything there were none who were willing. We will spend money now because otherwise, if the plutonium starts leaking, we will spend 10 times as much on fines alone.

At the next session of the commission we shall be considering a document with this name: The Threat to National Security in Connection With Reduction of the Fertility of the Soil. Last month we considered technogenic accidents.

There they have significant nongovernmental organizations, for example, ecological ones, which will not allow the ruling party to make big mistakes. This is not fighting, but cooperation in administration. But here...if at that damned meeting on the development of nuclear energy I had not simply spoken with emotion and I simply shouted there that this program must not be adopted and if instead I had a well substantiated, well argued document...but under our conditions it is impossible to get such a document through state structures.

For example, the program for the development of energy is now being considered. At best we will receive nuclear energy at the previous level, and at worst on an even larger scale. And yet there are other possibilities!

At best we will receive nuclear energy at the previous level, and at worst on an even larger scale. And yet there are other possibilities! SU fighter engines use kinds of technical solutions that, if applied in gas turbine electric power plants, in three years and with $6 billion we could solve the problem of energy supply.
 FBIS3-22191 
And yet there are other possibilities! SU fighter engines use kinds of technical solutions that, if applied in gas turbine electric power plants, in three years and with $6 billion we could solve the problem of energy supply.

They did it! How? The polluter pays, and not mythical fines but enough to reimburse the society for damages.

The polluter pays, and not mythical fines but enough to reimburse the society for damages. Then there is payment for the utilization of nature. If there is no master of the land this means, in the first place, that you can pollute wherever you want to and, in the second place, nobody is responsible.

Then there is payment for the utilization of nature. If there is no master of the land this means, in the first place, that you can pollute wherever you want to and, in the second place, nobody is responsible.

If there is no master of the land this means, in the first place, that you can pollute wherever you want to and, in the second place, nobody is responsible. And, finally, instead of writing complaints we must learn how to defend our rights in court. And we even have precedents.
 FBIS3-22191 
And, finally, instead of writing complaints we must learn how to defend our rights in court. And we even have precedents. The socioecological alliance took the government to court for a resolution concerning the development of the nuclear power industry, and the Constitutional Court accepted it.

And we even have precedents. The socioecological alliance took the government to court for a resolution concerning the development of the nuclear power industry, and the Constitutional Court accepted it. And I know that the government started thinking.

Yablokov: A good example. You know the ecological significance of this discharge? None.
 FBIS3-22191 
You know the ecological significance of this discharge? None. The radioactivity was 0.38 curies.

None. The radioactivity was 0.38 curies. Japanese nuclear power plants annually discharge hundreds of curies.

The radioactivity was 0.38 curies. Japanese nuclear power plants annually discharge hundreds of curies. The British and French thousands of curies a year.
 FBIS3-22191 
Japanese nuclear power plants annually discharge hundreds of curies. The British and French thousands of curies a year. Such is the scale of the event.
 FBIS3-22191 
The British and French thousands of curies a year. Such is the scale of the event. Shevelev: Why did our government have to take the blame for this?
 FBIS3-22191 
Such is the scale of the event. Shevelev: Why did our government have to take the blame for this? Yablokov: Most likely they were afraid of a political outcry.
 FBIS3-22191 
Shevelev: Why did our government have to take the blame for this? Yablokov: Most likely they were afraid of a political outcry. But the people who made this affair public they were highly professional.
 FBIS3-22191 
Yablokov: Most likely they were afraid of a political outcry. But the people who made this affair public they were highly professional. They must have known that radioactivity below one curie is not even considered pollution.
 FBIS3-22191 
But the people who made this affair public they were highly professional. They must have known that radioactivity below one curie is not even considered pollution. But then you wonder why?
 FBIS3-22191 
They must have known that radioactivity below one curie is not even considered pollution. But then you wonder why? Shevelev: So the only result of all the hubbub were credits obtained to modernize and construct plants for processing radioactive wastes.
 FBIS3-22191 
But then you wonder why? Shevelev: So the only result of all the hubbub were credits obtained to modernize and construct plants for processing radioactive wastes. Yablokov: So it would seem.
 FBIS3-22191 
Shevelev: So the only result of all the hubbub were credits obtained to modernize and construct plants for processing radioactive wastes. Yablokov: So it would seem.

Shevelev: Since our discussion has come around to the ecological movement, are you not disturbed by the fact that these organizations have frequently taken nationalistic positions? Yablokov: I am. The ecological movements were the first manifestations of the opposition to be allowed.

Yablokov: I am. The ecological movements were the first manifestations of the opposition to be allowed. And what did they produce?
 FBIS3-22191 
The ecological movements were the first manifestations of the opposition to be allowed. And what did they produce? Rigid, uncompromising nationalistic organizations in the Baltic, Moldova, Ukraine, and Armenia.

The picture is similar in Russia. This makes me bitter because I have fundamental political differences with Rasputin who, like myself, is protecting Lake Baykal.

This makes me bitter because I have fundamental political differences with Rasputin who, like myself, is protecting Lake Baykal. But he is an absolutely sincere person and he speculates a very great deal...any argument of the nationalists: the birth rate is declining, the nation is dying out! But we should not juggle the facts: Even ten years ago all predictions said that we were proceeding toward these indicators.

Actions in replacing technical channels at RBMK [high power pressurized tube reactor] power generators and steam generators at power generators with VVER [water moderated power reactor] reactors do not increase safety as compared to the design level they only remove design faults discovered in the process of exploitation.

Of much greater interest is something else: In February of this year the Russian Gosatomnadzor, known in the past for the extreme caution of its statements, suddenly subjected the state of the Russian nuclear complex to sharp criticism.

Not the workers but interested individuals, of whom there are many times more, are disturbed by one extremely significant aspect of this departmental cataclysm. The GKChS does not intend to take the administration of social protection under its mantle. Thus the main function of Goskomchernobyl will atrophy to a significant degree it will have to be performed by the Ministry of Social Protection, which has enough problems of its own without orphan children and the elderly.
