Two letters and a postcard written by Anne Frank and her sister, Margot, were sold to an anonymous bidder at an auction Tuesday for $150,000. The young Jewish Holocaust victims mailed the notes along with two photographs to American pen pals in 1940, a month before Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands, prompting the Franks to go into hiding. The successful bidder said he represented a number of institutions but would not specify further, said Will Bennett, spokesman for Swann Galleries, the auction house.

When Philip B. Petersen was convicted in 1986 of stealing more than $200,000 worth of historical documents from the Thomas A. Edison National Historic Site, he promised to give all the artifacts back. Petersen, 68, admitted Friday that he hadn't kept his word. The former Stanford University professor pleaded guilty to selling more artifacts from the museum, admitting that he had hidden some of his booty from federal agents investigating the heist three years ago.

From the days when inventor Thomas Edison's light bulb first lit the nights of 1879, Americans have been regarded as naturally inventive and creative. Much of that innovation derives from the work of scientists and engineers at General Electric's Research and Development Center, which traces its roots to the Edison Electrical Light Company formed in 1878 to support the experiments of Thomas Edison. GE scientists brainstormed the magnetic resonance imager, which uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create pictures of internal organs without X rays.

Your Oct. 13 page one story on the renewed plight of Western Union says that Western Union had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down Alexander Graham Bell's offer to it of his invention, because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph. Such is hardly the case. Bell's father in law, Gardner G. Hubbard, wealthy and well connected, obtained financing to start the American Bell Telephone Co. in Boston, which even had a subsidiary in New York called the Telephone Co. of New York.

Norbert Rillieux and Jan Matzeliger helped revolutionize American history with their inventions, but the two men scarcely rate a footnote in the annals of Yankee ingenuity simply because they were black. Historian Portia James is setting matters straight with an ambitious new Smithsonian Institution exhibition that celebrates the genius of America's unsung black inventors. The show, which opens Sunday, pays belated tribute to 40 inventors whose creations include a trouser stretching device for eliminating wrinkles, a machine for producing paper bags, a press for baling cotton and a mechanical traffic signal patented in 1923.

Among his other inventions: the first plastic underwire bra for Playtex, a super strong Velcro for Velcro Fastening Systems, a burglar alarm that hangs on a doorknob and square milk jugs that save shipping space. Mason dates his first invention to his youth, when he sold a slingshot like weapon to scores of friends.

BACK IN 1984, TV viewers were amused by a clever new commercial in which a man in a bar hollered Gimme a light, but was served a flaming torch instead of a mug of beer. That, of course, marked the start of Anheuser Busch's memorable funny lights commercials for Bud Light. Since then, there has been everything from a bug light to train headlights, and the ad campaign has consistently ranked as one of the 10 most popular on the air.

Imagination is running riot, as usual, in the world of new fiction. Here, for example, are a few of the spring's more diverting plot kernels: A woman, buried in the rubble of a department store, has a love affair with an advertising executive trapped nearby ( Strangers, by Rosie Thomas). A woman is marooned on an island with a man named Robinson Cruso, and then, back in London, feuds with a novelist named Daniel Foe when he won't write her story accurately ( Foe, by J.M.

The injected genes are incorporated into the developing animal to create a transgenic animal, one which bears genes of other species.

Your account of how Western Union supposedly scorned Bell's telephone as a toy (second section, Dec. 15) repeats a long running myth. In researching the telephone's centennial for a 1976 article, I learned there is no hard evidence of an offer of the Bell patents to Western Union for $100,000. The only mention of it appears nearly 40 years afterward in a recollection by Bell's assistant, Thomas Watson.
