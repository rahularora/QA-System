CBS Inc. unveiled its most radically restructured fall prime time television schedule ever in a gamble to revive its stagnant ratings. The company said its second ranked television network, which posted its lowest prime time ratings ever in the just ended 1986 87 season, will replace eight of its 22 hours of weekly prime time programming in September and bring back 15 current series. That is the most hours of programming ever replaced by the CBS network, topping the 7 1/2 hours it scrapped in fall 1977, CBS research officials said.

The Flash, a very expensive, heavily promoted video version of the comic book character, was part of that drive to lower the age of the network's average viewer, which seemed until recently to be just shy of Methuselah. ; But the show never caught on and will not be back in the fall; neither will Dallas, whose cancellation was announced a few weeks ago. Also disappearing are Guns of Paradise, The Antagonists, Doctor, Doctor, Good Sports and three shows that will never return from the dreaded hiatus: WIOU, Lenny and Family Man.

Now, like the fictional TV station that will be depicted in WIOU for CBS Inc.'s network, Mr. Tinker is poised to begin again, this time without a company handing him a blank check. He has yet to find another financial partner despite hiring the investment banking firm of Furman Selz Mager Dietz &amp; Birney in January. New backers may well be leery; Gannett spent more than $40 million in prime time production costs, more than another $45 million on USA Today on TV, $24 million to buy the Culver City studios for the venture and another $25 million in renovations.

Orion's development season didn't work as well as they might have hoped, so they're a willing partner, says Mr. Tinker.
