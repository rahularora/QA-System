Alzheimer's disease, causing dementia and death, afflicts an estimated 3.5 million Americans. Hopes for treatment were buoyed in the late 1980s by Fred M. Gage, a neuroscientist at the University of California at San Diego. Dr. Gage taught a group of senile rats to swim through a water maze.

After a 10 day rest period, the rats were put through their aquatic paces again. Only the rats treated with nerve growth factor found their way through the maze. In a variety of learning and memory tests, it was shown infusions of nerve growth factor into the brain could improve learning capacity and increased the size of neurons that had shrunken, says Dr. Gage.

Dennis Day, the Irish tenor best known as Jack Benny's comic sidekick, was remembered Thursday as a loving man devoted to helping himself and others battle Lou Gehrig's disease.

He had never fully recovered from a fall 3{ months ago, and returned home after treatment this week at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica.

The preliminary finding strengthens the growing belief that a class of newly discovered proteins that promote nerve cell growth may be useful against several intractable nerve and brain disorders. In particular, Regeneron said its experimental protein therapy may be useful in treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, a deadly muscle destroying illness also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. At present, there is no effective treatment for the disease.

At present, there is no effective treatment for the disease. Speaking at the Society for Neuroscience's meeting here yesterday, a Regeneron scientist reported the first use of the drug, called ciliary nerve trophic factor, or CNTF, in a strain of mice whose leg muscles naturally deteriorate as they age, much in the manner of patients with ALS.

; More recent years have produced another pair of heroes, both pitchers: Dave Dravecky of the San Francisco Giants and Jim Abbott, a California Angel. Dravecky was stricken, mid career, with cancer in one of the major muscles of his pitching arm and had to submit to surgery. Just a little more than a year after that trauma, he returned to the game to pitch seven great innings for the Giants, helping them to win their division title.

The government is failing to adequately recognize or regulate chemicals that lead to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and other neurological disorders, a congressional report says. A study by the Office of Technology Assessment said federal agencies must give more attention to nervous system disorders caused in part by environmental toxins and should do the research necessary for new rule making. Millions of American workers are exposed to neurotoxic substances in the workplace, but illness stemming from these exposures often goes undetected and untreated, the study said.
