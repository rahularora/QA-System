The problem of the refugees reflects what is going on in Haiti, and we must attempt to address the cause rather than the effects, and the cause is human rights violations in Haiti, Modeste said. As for the possibility that Grenada could participate in a possible military operation against the Haitian coupists, who usurped power from Aristide in September 1991, Modeste said Grenada does not have an Army, but would be willing to help train a more responsible Haitian police once the military return power to Aristide. The Haitian crisis has been one of the central points discussed at the OAS General Assembly, which began on 6 June and could end tomorrow, a day earlier than scheduled, given the swiftness with which the various committees advanced in their work.
