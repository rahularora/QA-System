But what about the profanation of that older symbol, the cross? With all the clucking over blasphemy in the work of Salman Rushdie, where is the fury over Madonna's flaunting a crucifix in a churchlike set while simulating various acts not condoned by orthodoxy? The Vatican, of course, objected, but the Vatican also arrested the comedian Don Novello when he showed up there in his costume as Father Guido Sarducci.

Perhaps, but she is up to something nastier than Mr. Novello, something much more fundamentally subversive about Catholicism and her heritage in general, especially in the new film, something hovering between reverence and nastiness.

A Christian organization called Friday for a boycott of Pepsi because the soft drink maker refused to cancel its contract with the singer Madonna, who also is starring in a steamy music video set in a church. The American Family Association, based in Tupelo, Miss., said it was asking people not to drink Pepsi for a year because Pepsi rejected its request to cancel a contract with Madonna for her appearance in a Pepsi commercial. It is indeed unfortunate that Pepsi would give Madonna millions of dollars for the right to promote her as a role model for our youth, said Donmald E. Wildmon, executive director of the association.

The distributors of rock star Madonna's new single, Like a Prayer, decided not to release the video immediately on Italian television because of protests from a Roman Catholic group, news reports said Saturday. The conservative Catholic group Famiglia Domani charged the video was blasphemous, and it threatened to go to court to block the broadcast, newspapers said. The video was to be shown Tuesday on the popular program Notte Rock (Rock Night) on state run RAI television.

Madonna, the pop singer turned actress, celebrated her 30th birthday with a Broadway stage performance and a private party with her actor husband, Sean Penn, and other guests. But Tuesday's celebrations were continuing today, Penn's 28th birthday and the couple's third anniversary. Despite all the predictions, they're still together, said publicist Liz Rosenberg.

The MTV Music Video Awards, not noted for their cultural significance, produced a curious mixture of censorship protests and upset victories at their seventh annual ceremony. Irish pop singer Sinead O'Connor breezed past American bombshell Madonna during Thursday night's three hour show and took top video, best female video and the postmodern awards for her stark Nothing Compares 2 U. Madonna, who performed a racy version of her Vogue video dressed in an 18th century French costume bursting at the bust, won for direction, cinematography and editing none of which go to her. O'Connor created a flap last month when she threatened to walk out on an audience of 9,000 at the Garden State Arts Center in New Jersey if the state owned arena played the national anthem before her show.

Pepsi Cola Co. said Wednesday it had signed pop star Madonna for a global ad campaign that industry watchers said would chart virgin waters by debuting a song in a television commercial. Pepsi firing the latest volley in the newly escalating marketing war with Coca Cola Co. also will sponsor a planned world tour by the actress singer later in 1989 after the release of Madonna's first album in three years, Like A Prayer. The Madonna announcement comes on the heels of industry leader Coke's new ad campaign aimed at pushing sales of Diet Coke past Pepsi, currently second in the market behind Coke Classic.

Dr. Benjamin Spock says American society is sick and getting sicker, and one of its worst ailments is excessive competitiveness. Most children are brought up to believe you're in this world to get ahead, kid, Spock said in a commencement speech Monday at Yale University's School of Epidemiology and Public Health. Little League baseball should be abolished, he said, because it takes the fun out of athletics at an early age.
