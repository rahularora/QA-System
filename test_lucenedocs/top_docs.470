BFN [Text] La Paz, 22 Jun (LOS TIEMPOS) The metaphor about the milk and the cow was thoroughly explained today by President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, when he said that even if Bolivia gets a sovereign sea outlet it wants to take concrete steps on the sea issue with Chile it must also get several outlets on both the Pacific and Atlantic, with the full use of the port of Ilo in Peru as well as the Paraguay Parana waterway and other ports in Argentina and Uruguay. Even though the sea outlet claim is a valid issue, though problematic and difficult, we want to make progress in all fields cultural, political, and economic in all fields related to our great effort to have a sea outlet on the Pacific and outlets through the waterway, said President Sanchez at a news conference held today to talk about the positive aspects of his tour of the United States and Colombia.

This cannot be done unless we join the River Plate system. This is not an imposition, but it seems to apply. In addition, Argentina and Uruguay had to overcome several difficulties, and needed a lot of time before achieving the experience they now have.

This is not an imposition, but it seems to apply. In addition, Argentina and Uruguay had to overcome several difficulties, and needed a lot of time before achieving the experience they now have. A joint administration is the first step toward achieving an administrative system similar to those prevailing in several other international river systems.

In addition, Argentina and Uruguay had to overcome several difficulties, and needed a lot of time before achieving the experience they now have. A joint administration is the first step toward achieving an administrative system similar to those prevailing in several other international river systems. It would be an administrative support to this exceedingly complex system.

A joint administration is the first step toward achieving an administrative system similar to those prevailing in several other international river systems. It would be an administrative support to this exceedingly complex system. [EL PAIS] Does Paraguay agree to this position?

It would be an administrative support to this exceedingly complex system. [EL PAIS] Does Paraguay agree to this position? [Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, I believe it does.
 FBIS3-32085 
[EL PAIS] Does Paraguay agree to this position? [Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, I believe it does. We are very close to Paraguay.
 FBIS3-32085 
[Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, I believe it does. We are very close to Paraguay. Our relations have changed very much after decades of susceptibilities and clashes resulting from the Chaco War.
 FBIS3-32085 
We are very close to Paraguay. Our relations have changed very much after decades of susceptibilities and clashes resulting from the Chaco War. In this radical change, the Bolivian and Paraguayan leaders are reaching a level of relations that had already been achieved by our peoples.

Our relations have changed very much after decades of susceptibilities and clashes resulting from the Chaco War. In this radical change, the Bolivian and Paraguayan leaders are reaching a level of relations that had already been achieved by our peoples. I also believe that our landlocked situation strongly unites us as a result of our geographical and socioeconomic realities.

In this radical change, the Bolivian and Paraguayan leaders are reaching a level of relations that had already been achieved by our peoples. I also believe that our landlocked situation strongly unites us as a result of our geographical and socioeconomic realities. [EL PAIS] You talked about the possibility of seeking a way of integration between Bolivia and Mercosur through a free trade zone.

I also believe that our landlocked situation strongly unites us as a result of our geographical and socioeconomic realities. [EL PAIS] You talked about the possibility of seeking a way of integration between Bolivia and Mercosur through a free trade zone. In this regard what could be obtained, taking into account that for five years Bolivia cannot become a Mercosur member?
 FBIS3-32085 
[EL PAIS] You talked about the possibility of seeking a way of integration between Bolivia and Mercosur through a free trade zone. In this regard what could be obtained, taking into account that for five years Bolivia cannot become a Mercosur member? [Sanchez de Lozada] ...No, in 1996... but if there is the political will, we could become a member tomorrow.
 FBIS3-32085 
In this regard what could be obtained, taking into account that for five years Bolivia cannot become a Mercosur member? [Sanchez de Lozada] ...No, in 1996... but if there is the political will, we could become a member tomorrow. If there is consensus, an exception could be made.
 FBIS3-32085 
[Sanchez de Lozada] ...No, in 1996... but if there is the political will, we could become a member tomorrow. If there is consensus, an exception could be made. This is what we seek: By being an observer, we are linked to Mercosur; it is a bit uncomfortable, but we are linked to it.
 FBIS3-32085 
If there is consensus, an exception could be made. This is what we seek: By being an observer, we are linked to Mercosur; it is a bit uncomfortable, but we are linked to it. Seeking a free trade zone is like supporting Mercosur; although it is still not a common market, it has no tariff.
 FBIS3-32085 
This is what we seek: By being an observer, we are linked to Mercosur; it is a bit uncomfortable, but we are linked to it. Seeking a free trade zone is like supporting Mercosur; although it is still not a common market, it has no tariff. Therefore, it is a bit like getting to the point where the other countries already are.
 FBIS3-32085 
Seeking a free trade zone is like supporting Mercosur; although it is still not a common market, it has no tariff. Therefore, it is a bit like getting to the point where the other countries already are. And as an observer, it is watching the negotiations for a free trade agreement, trying to find the political, juridical, and economic conditions to become a full member.
 FBIS3-32085 
Therefore, it is a bit like getting to the point where the other countries already are. And as an observer, it is watching the negotiations for a free trade agreement, trying to find the political, juridical, and economic conditions to become a full member. But we must move with great prudence and care, because we have other relations and commitments.

And as an observer, it is watching the negotiations for a free trade agreement, trying to find the political, juridical, and economic conditions to become a full member. But we must move with great prudence and care, because we have other relations and commitments. I came here above all seeking the political will of the four countries to make Bolivia become a Mercosur member, seeking a greater commitment.
 FBIS3-32085 
But we must move with great prudence and care, because we have other relations and commitments. I came here above all seeking the political will of the four countries to make Bolivia become a Mercosur member, seeking a greater commitment.

 FBIS3-32085 
It is a way to open the path. [EL PAIS] Is your visit to Uruguay next March related to this issue? [Sanchez de Lozada] It has to do with this issue, but also with the relations with Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, which are very important to us.

[EL PAIS] Is your visit to Uruguay next March related to this issue? [Sanchez de Lozada] It has to do with this issue, but also with the relations with Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, which are very important to us.

[EL PAIS] Another issue proposed by Bolivia is the revival of Urupabol [Permanent Joint Commission of Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia]. What use would you have for this group, which in some ways already failed during the decade of the sixties? [Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, it failed because that was another time.
 FBIS3-32085 
What use would you have for this group, which in some ways already failed during the decade of the sixties? [Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, it failed because that was another time. I see the time as being very appropriate now, because it involves three small countries.
 FBIS3-32085 
[Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, it failed because that was another time. I see the time as being very appropriate now, because it involves three small countries. Uruguay is in another stage of its socioeconomic development, just like Paraguay and Bolivia.

I see the time as being very appropriate now, because it involves three small countries. Uruguay is in another stage of its socioeconomic development, just like Paraguay and Bolivia. But if these countries unite, they can make a greater impact under current conditions.

Uruguay is in another stage of its socioeconomic development, just like Paraguay and Bolivia. But if these countries unite, they can make a greater impact under current conditions. I believe this is like a hand with five fingers.
 FBIS3-32085 
But if these countries unite, they can make a greater impact under current conditions. I believe this is like a hand with five fingers. And the three of us have to face the pressures from Brazil and Argentina.
 FBIS3-32085 
I believe this is like a hand with five fingers. And the three of us have to face the pressures from Brazil and Argentina. Although the situation has changed, the relative size of our countries make us feel united in many ways, and there is also a lot of affinity and closeness on international issues.
 FBIS3-32085 
And the three of us have to face the pressures from Brazil and Argentina. Although the situation has changed, the relative size of our countries make us feel united in many ways, and there is also a lot of affinity and closeness on international issues.

 FBIS3-32085 
Sometimes a friendship is more valuable than an event. [EL PAIS] Your country has in the Andean Pact a special treatment on tariffs. Would Bolivia be willing to accept integration into a group like Mercosur, in which high tariffs are proposed for some products to protect an industry?
 FBIS3-32085 
[EL PAIS] Your country has in the Andean Pact a special treatment on tariffs. Would Bolivia be willing to accept integration into a group like Mercosur, in which high tariffs are proposed for some products to protect an industry?

 FBIS3-32085 
Would Bolivia be willing to accept integration into a group like Mercosur, in which high tariffs are proposed for some products to protect an industry? Would your country be willing to join even when it has always enjoyed low tariffs? Would it pay that price?
 FBIS3-32085 
Would your country be willing to join even when it has always enjoyed low tariffs? Would it pay that price? [Sanchez de Lozada] We will see about paying the price.
 FBIS3-32085 
Would it pay that price? [Sanchez de Lozada] We will see about paying the price. What we want is to participate, and to convince the large nations that high tariffs are a way of guaranteeing that their industries will never be competitive.
 FBIS3-32085 
[Sanchez de Lozada] We will see about paying the price. What we want is to participate, and to convince the large nations that high tariffs are a way of guaranteeing that their industries will never be competitive. We are not dogmatic, but a very poor country like Bolivia has come to the conclusion that protectionism stops the absorption of advanced technology.

What we want is to participate, and to convince the large nations that high tariffs are a way of guaranteeing that their industries will never be competitive. We are not dogmatic, but a very poor country like Bolivia has come to the conclusion that protectionism stops the absorption of advanced technology. Because it is only human nature when a businessman is protected, he will not seek competition.

We are not dogmatic, but a very poor country like Bolivia has come to the conclusion that protectionism stops the absorption of advanced technology. Because it is only human nature when a businessman is protected, he will not seek competition.

Because it is only human nature when a businessman is protected, he will not seek competition. And one of the reasons why we want to participate is because we believe that sometimes logic, explanation, and experience have a great deal of influence, especially in countries which are facing very powerful sectors.

[EL PAIS] From your point of view as Bolivian president, what is the future of the Andean Pact?
 FBIS3-32085 
Bolivia cannot force anybody, but it may have ideas for the future to help this process come to a happy conclusion. [EL PAIS] From your point of view as Bolivian president, what is the future of the Andean Pact? Apparently there is a bloc that functions well; Venezuela and Colombia, and the rest were left behind.

[EL PAIS] From your point of view as Bolivian president, what is the future of the Andean Pact? Apparently there is a bloc that functions well; Venezuela and Colombia, and the rest were left behind. [Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, this is a complex situation.

Apparently there is a bloc that functions well; Venezuela and Colombia, and the rest were left behind. [Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, this is a complex situation. Remember that for various reasons our activities and attention have been especially dedicated to Chile and to Mercosur.

But we are trying to get closer to Mercosur because we believe it is more valid and hopeful. [EL PAIS] And how do you see the Amazon Initiative started by Brazil?

[EL PAIS] And how do you see the Amazon Initiative started by Brazil? [Sanchez de Lozada] Brazil believes that this should be enlarged, and that impulse should be given to a Latin American free trade common market. But we believe this will not occur until a locomotive exists.

[Sanchez de Lozada] Brazil believes that this should be enlarged, and that impulse should be given to a Latin American free trade common market. But we believe this will not occur until a locomotive exists. And the locomotive is Mercosur.

Frei told EFE: It is true that Chile is a country open to the world, that it is going to join the South Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (APEC), and that the EU is our main commercial partner, but, regardless of this, Chile has a Latin American spirit and we have come to reassert this. Frei added that sound evidence of this are the recent proposals for a partnership with the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) and the proposals Chile made during the recent OAS General Assembly in Brazil. Upon joining the Fourth Ibero American Summit, which will last two days in Cartagena de Indias, he said Chile will participate with the hope and will make every effort possible in this direction that it will mark the starting point, in practice rather than in theory, of a real integration of the hemisphere.

In Frei's opinion, the main thing to attaining these goals is commercial opening through negotiated agreements with a spirit of open regionalism that will cast aside protectionism and grant the continent access to the major markets, free of exclusions and closed blocs.
