Millions of older women can keep their bones strong and help avoid the crippling effects of osteoporosis simply by consuming every day the amount of calcium contained in three glasses of milk, a study today concludes. Osteoporosis, the brittle bone disease, is one of the most common afflictions of growing old. It affects an estimated 15 million to 20 million Americans and primarily strikes women after menopause, when their bodies make less estrogen.

Osteoporosis, the brittle bone disease, is one of the most common afflictions of growing old. It affects an estimated 15 million to 20 million Americans and primarily strikes women after menopause, when their bodies make less estrogen. The research found that by bringing up calcium consumption to the recommended daily allowance 800 milligrams or the equivalent of 24 ounces of milk can completely stop the loss of bone in the hips, wrist and spine after about age 55.

Consuming a lot of calcium may not prevent hip fractures in older people, a British study concluded. The report, in this week's British Medical Journal, found physical activity offers greater protection than dietary calcium. The finding will reignite a protracted controversy over whether increased calcium intake helps avoid osteoporosis.

Greater consumption of calcium could lower individuals' chances of fracturing their hips later in life, a California study suggests.

Women can help prevent brittle bones in old age by regularly consuming dairy products throughout their lives, but calcium supplements taken after menopause probably won't be effective, researchers say. In a study in today's Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers said the key factors in bone density among post menopausal women were lifelong calcium intake and the naturally occurring hormone estrone. Moderate exercise and calcium supplements taken later in life do not appear to prevent osteoporosis, a frequently debilitating disease most common among women in which the bones become thinner and more brittle, they found.

Americans are getting only a third to half the calcium they need, despite the calcium craze that sent people running to drugstores for pills to supplement their diets. Much has been made of calcium in recent years because of osteoporosis, the weakening of the bones, generally with age, due to loss of calcium, declining levels of sex hormones, hereditary factors and other things. Women generally become susceptible at menopause, men at a later age.

Women can help prevent brittle bones in old age by regularly consuming dairy products throughout their lives, but calcium supplements taken after menopause probably won't be effective, researchers say. In a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers said the key factors in bone density among post menopausal women were lifelong calcium intake and the naturally occurring hormone estrone. Moderate exercise and calcium supplements taken later in life do not appear to prevent osteoporosis, a frequently debilitating disease most common among women in which the bones become thinner and more brittle, they found.

Boron, an element long used as a water softener and mouthwash, apparently plays an important role in hardening bones and could help prevent osteoporosis, the Agriculture Department said. A six month study measuring the effects of boron in the diets of 12 postmenopausal women showed that the element reduced the loss of calcium, magnesium and phosphorus, and raised blood levels of estrogen and other hormonal steroids. These elements and hormonal steroids are important in maintaining the integrity of the bone, said Forrest H. Nielsen, a nutritionist with the department's Agricultural Research Service which conducted the study.

Probably fewer than 10 percent of the known cases of osteoporosis are among men, though I'm sure there is a lot more of it out there than we see, he said Thursday, adding there has not been much research on osteoporosis in men. Osteoporosis results in a loss of bone density and may be accompanied by increasing porosity and brittleness. Most common in women, it can lead to spinal crush fractures that cause dowager's hump and pain, said Johnston.

Men lose roughly 2 percent of their existing bone mass per year in the same type of loss that can severely affect women after menopause, a study indicates. There is a problem with osteoporosis in men that hasn't been appreciated.

A major dietary study suggests that humans are a vegetarian species whose risk of disease is increased by eating meat and animal products, says a Cornell University researcher. A plant based diet is more likely to promote good health and reduce the risks of heart problems, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis and other diseases, according to the preliminary findings of the continuing study in China. People who eat mostly plant foods and a generous variety of plant foods ... that is the kind of diet that is most likely to be associated with reduced risk of the kinds of disease that tend to kill us in this country, said T. Colin Campbell, a nutritional biochemist who directed the continuing study.

Israeli researchers have found a link between sex hormones and the skeletal system of animals, opening the way to a better understanding of osteoporosis, the Weizmann Institute of Science said Sunday. The findings could help explain the high incidence of the degenerative bone disease in women following menopause, a statement from the institute said. The institute discovered in recent experiments with laboratory rats that the skeletal system responds to the animal's main sex hormone, the institute's statement said.

A National Research Council report that said vitamin pills and some other dietary supplements are useless and perhaps harmful was denounced as a disservice to all Americans by a trade group. The group, called the Council for Responsible Nutrition, said that the NRC report released Wednesday failed to acknowledge what it called emerging research on benefits from supplements of vitamins, fiber and calcium. The NRC report provides only a shallow review of the evidence on the benefits of nutritional supplements and fails to reflect the tide of research that supports those benefits, the trade association said in a prepared statement.

In the latest work, 429 women with osteoporosis were randomly assigned to take etidronate or dummy placebos for two years.

Synthetic hormones women take to counter symptoms of menopause also prevent adverse changes in cholesterol levels, according to a study released today. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh found in a survey of 101 women that menopause naturally produced changes in blood cholesterol that may explain why older women have an increased risk of heart attacks. But the researchers found that women who took hormone supplements to relieve menopause related problems didn't suffer adverse cholesterol changes.

In this group, a fifth were taking estrogen in 1986, a fourth had taken the hormone in the past but were no longer taking it and 53% had never taken estrogen. The incidence of heart attacks in the post menopausal women during the decade was sharply lower among those nurses currently taking estrogen than among those who never took the hormone, the researchers report.

They noted, for instance, that a woman has a 0.6% absolute risk of dying of complications of a hip fracture. A 60% lower relative risk of a hip fracture equals a 0.36% reduction in absolute risk.

Americans are eating too much animal fat and government regulations make it difficult for the food industry to market leaner and more healthful meats and dairy products, a scientific panel said Tuesday. Although consumption of animal fat has gone down, many Americans still are eating their way to poor health with too much cholesterol, fatty acids and salt, and not enough foods that provide the needed calcium and iron said a report by a committee of the National Research Council. It said the incidence of nutrition related health problems is significant, affecting either directly or indirectly nearly every American family.

Women using estrogen after menopause run a slightly greater risk of breast cancer, according to a study of more than 118,000 nurses. But the authors of the study, which appears in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association, emphasized that the increased risk was modest and noted estrogen therapy holds many benefits for post menopausal women. While this study adds to a large body of information, I would not recommend that a woman change her current use of estrogen therapy based on these data alone, said one of the authors, Dr. Meir Stampfer, of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston.

In their running battle, Glaxo and SmithKline each have exploited the publication of scientific studies supporting their own product or questioning the competitor's product.

Tagamet and Zantac are known as H2 antagonists in that they help heal ulcers by blocking the action of histamine, a hormone like chemical that triggers the release of stomach acid.

Americans eat too much animal fat and the government should rewrite its regulations to encourage the production of leaner meats and dairy products, the National Research Council said today. The council, in a report on a 2{ year study, said that despite a decline in fat consumption in recent years, Americans' dietary habits still center too heavily on meat and dairy products rich in animal fats, which can cause a variety of health problems. The nutrition related health problems experienced by a large segment of the U.S. population today arise from overconsumption of fat, saturated fatty acids, and cholesterol, the report said.

Women shouldn't throw out their thyroid prescriptions even though a commonly prescribed hormone may cause some long term thinning of the bones, a doctor said. The most commonly prescribed thyroid hormone, L thyroxine, previously had been considered safe when taken over a number of years, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. But 31 young women treated with L thyroxine for at least five years were found to have 10% to 13% less bone density in their hips than 31 women in a comparison group matched for age and weight, the study said.

We are saying the dose of Lthyroxine should be carefully adjusted to the individual need of the patient, which can now be done with sensitive new assays. Before new tests were developed about two years ago to measure precise blood levels of L thyroxine, marketed as Levothroid and Synthroid, doctors were more likely to prescribe excess levels, Dr. Braverman said. Most of the millions of patients who take it must do so indefinitely to counteract the hormone deficiency created by an underactive thyroid gland, thyroid cancer or a condition known as goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid that leads to a swelling of the neck.

Tales of 120 year old yogurt eaters with the boundless energy of adolescents made memorable television commercials and fed the notion that even if it is not the key to eternal youth, yogurt sure is healthy. Hence workers lunching at their desks with little containers of fruit flavored yogurt, or shoppers choosing frozen yogurt over ice cream, or parents getting their kids to snack on yogurt. Americans eat 4.6 pounds per person annually, a 110 percent increase in 10 years, according to the National Yogurt Association.
