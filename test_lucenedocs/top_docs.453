Brass bands marched down the Champs Elysees today and scores of planes streaked across the sky, leaving a trail of blue, white and red smoke wafting over the heads of hundreds of thousands of bicentennial revelers. Celebrants danced and frolicked into the wee hours this morning at nearly a dozen places around Paris to celebrate the July 14, 1789, storming of the Bastille prison. The thousands of revolutionaries who rushed the hated prison found only seven inmates to free, locked up not for their politics but for fraud, incest and lunacy, but the action marked the beginning of the French Revolution.

Local television and radio broadcast the Bastille Day celebrations in Paris Thursday and Friday.

There are many variations of the Revolution, but in broad terms French rightists are likely to say they approve of the abolition of the nobility's privileges in 1789 and the establishment of the republic in 1792, but are appalled by the mass executions of the Terror in 1793 94.

The French Revolution has been a focus for political divisions ever since it began, and the approach of the bicentennial renewed the debate over what, exactly, was being celebrated. There are many variations of the Revolution, but in broad terms French rightists are likely to say they approve of the abolition of the nobility's privileges in 1789 and the establishment of the republic in 1792, but are appalled by the mass executions of the Terror in 1793 94. Some French leftists argue that people should take the Revolution as an undivided whole and be for it or against it.

It's surprising that, two centuries later, the founding act of the Republic remains a propaganda tool and a source of partisan quarrels and polemics, but it's also a consequence of the revolutionary heritage itself, the independent newspaper Le Monde wrote in a front page article summing up the squabbles.

The focus will be on an assembly of nearly 30 world leaders, on spectacular parades and fireworks, and on the inauguration of a new Opera house at the Place de la Bastille, where a mob stormed the hated Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, to launch the revolution. Among the chiefs of state on hand will be President Bush, for the annual economic summit of the world's seven largest industrial democracies.

Heads of state streamed into Paris Wednesday, many hoping to lobby for debt relief from the world's richest nations during opulent celebrations marking 200 years since the French Revolution. By Friday, 32 leaders were expected for the economic summit, including government heads from the seven largest industrialized democracies and 25 more from five continents. Also Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney presented France with a monumental oil painting to hang in the hall of the Opera Bastille, which was designed by a Canadian architect for the bicentennial.

But the crux of a thrilling, infuriating weekend the French will never forget seemed to be the traditional July 14 morning event, when France paraded its missiles down the Champs Elysees. Behind glass at the Place de la Concorde, President Francois Mitterrand was flanked by the leaders of 33 nations from five continents, including six of the richest and some of the poorest. He sat between George Bush, president of a superpower, and Felix Houphouet Boigny of the Ivory Coast, symbol of an empire France colonized and, by its measure, civilized.

Your challenge is enormous and historic: to build a structure of political change and decentralized economic enterprise on the ruins of a failed Stalinist system, Bush said in a speech Wednesday at the Karl Marx University of Economic Sciences. Imre Pozgay, one of Hungary's four communist leaders, told Bush the changes in his country were irreversible and added the government would accept the results of free elections set for next year and step down if defeated. Bush promised he will press for a coordinated plan of further assistance for Poland and Hungary at the annual economic summit with leaders of France, Britain, West Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan.

The revolution exported to France by Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette is being celebrated with many refrains from the American bicentennial: fireworks, rock concerts, street dances, a passage of tall ships from Rouen to Le Havre, a parade of 5l bands featuring 760 trombones, and a full sized replica of the Statue of Liberty flame placed at the beginning of Avenue de New York by the International Herald Tribune. On July l4, when all subways and buses are free, American soprano Jessye Norman will star in Homage a La Marseillaise, a show business extravaganza at Place de la Concorde, where the guillotine stood. Norman will sing the national anthem, written three years after the Bastille fell.

Norman will sing the national anthem, written three years after the Bastille fell. The Marseillaise was composed by Rouget de Lisle, a 32 year old army officer who happened to be in Strasbourg at the time, spent most of the Terror in prison and later wrote a less known anthem honoring the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy.

The revolution that began as a neighborhood disturbance in the Faubourg St. Antoine by the sans culottes, artisans and shopkeepers who did not wear the fancy knee breeches of the aristocracy, led to the Declaration of Rights of Man and the Citizen and the eventual overthrow of the monarchy.

Many haute couture shops in chic districts closed their doors in dismay at picnicking tourist crowds celebrating the bicentennial, but restaurants, cafes and bakery shops did a brisk business. Party goers, their mouths stuffed with pastry, seemed to make a mockery of the disdainful Revolutionary era remark about letting the hungry mob eat cake. But by the wee hours of the morning Saturday, when one famished reporter was looking for nourishment, there was nothing to be found.

High wire artist Philippe Petit walked a tightrope soaring over Paris to the second level of the Eiffel Tower on Saturday, and said later his biggest problem was trying not to have too much fun. With a brisk breeze blowing off the Seine River, Petit leaped onto the rope at the Palais de Chaillot and walked 2,300 feet on a cord set at a 16 degree angle to the Eiffel Tower's second level, 330 feet above the sidewalk. Thousands of people watched breathlessly as he crossed the length of more than seven football fields on a wire as thin as three pencils, occasionally stopping to salute the graceful tower.
