The observatory, where Greenwich mean time was once calculated as the reference point for the world's time zones, is expected to move into Cambridge University in 1990. Time has passed the operation by. The reason for the move from Herstmonceux Castle is that most of the observatory's observational work is now done overseas, atmospheric conditions abroad being far more favorable than anywhere in the British Isles, says Bill Yates, a London real estate agent.

Loose talk about the special relationship between the U.S. and Britain was once again in the air when I found myself here in Northamptonshire recently. As an antidote to the pseudo history in the press, I decided to walk two miles down a country road and visit this village, where George Washington's ancestors are buried and where the Tudor manor house from which his great great grandfather emigrated to Virginia in 1656 still stands. Were it not for this historical connection Sulgrave would no doubt be as unvisited as its neighboring small villages, tucked away in rolling farmland, but in 1914 a body of British subscribers, headed by King George V, bought Sulgrave Manor and presented it to the peoples of the U.S. and Great Britain to celebrate 100 years of continuing peace between them.

The original endowment leaves the house underfunded, deathwatch beetle and woodworm have to be contended with, and the demands of conservation are continually on the increase.

IT WAS a burning childhood ambition of Bill Galbraith's to have his own clockmaking workshop. This ambition was doubtless fired by the fact that he was bred to clockmaking, but was born not long before his grandfather's clock shop was a casualty of that infamous recession of the early 1930s. On demob from the Second World War, Galbraith headed for London and now has his own business, with workshops in both London and Fowey, Cornwall.

It's not the heat but a faulty bearing that has stopped the clock of Big Ben three times this week, the government said Friday. The hands of the famous clock on the tower of the Houses of Parliament stopped at 5:11 a.m. Friday, which is about where they snagged on Wednesday and Thursday nights. We believe, as a result of investigations carried out this morning, that the problem is to do with a bearing in the eastern face of the clock, and that once that bearing has been replaced or lubricated, that the problem will go away, said Toby Sargent, spokesman for the Department of Environment.

So when I do articles and interviews, I talk about my past drug experiences with needles, almost dying and how fortunate I am to come out of it and be sane and still have my wits about me somewhat. Boston based Aerosmith is enjoying huge success with the album Pump only a few years after Tyler, guitarists Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, drummer Joey Kramer and bassist Tom Hamilton required treatment for drug dependency.

A growing interest in traditional interiors has helped pave the way for the return of the grandfather clock to a place of honor in many American homes. Originally known as a tall or a long case clock (it is still so called in the antique circuit), it became a grandfather clock because of the popularity of the song, My Grandfather's Clock, around 1875. According to John Snellenburg, a vice president at Christie's and a specialist in clocks and watches, interest in buying grandfather clocks is high, though the clocks don't get much publicity.

It is certainly the best commercial clock ever made, Mr. Cutler says. Once upon a time, time was measured by the rotation of the Earth and the movement of the solar system. But now, the internationally accepted unit of time is based on the resonance frequency of the cesium atom, which is about nine billion cycles a second.

Adolf Dresen, the producer, had done away with Rococo finery and set the piece in the years just before the First World War.

Swatches have been the surprise ugly ducklings in this field since, in the public's mind, they mix mass production with a hyped fashion appeal. But not all Swatch models are made in high number series; take, for instance, the two Velvet Undergrounds enveloped in black or white stocking mesh which sold for Pounds 7,000 at Christie's in London on May 8. This sum at the bottom end of the estimate for these 1985 models, produced in 500 examples only, was still a respectable performance in a themed section of a general sale which, the auctioneers admitted was not as buoyant as had been hoped, and contained a high level of casualties.

Four American scientists reacted with delight Thursday at being named Nobel Prize winners for their work in physics and chemistry, and one said it was time to go back to the lab and do more work. The physics award was given to Norman F. Ramsey of Harvard University for measurement techniques that led to the cesium atomic clock, and to Hans G. Dehmelt of the University of Washington and Wolfgang Paul of West Germany for a method to isolate single atoms and make exacting measurements of them. The Nobel Prize in chemistry is shared by Thomas Cech, 41, of the University of Colorado, and Sidney Altman, 50, of Yale University.

London's trading system coped with the October crash in world stock prices reasonably well, and the impact on the British economy so far seems to be modest, the Bank of England said. The bank's report notes that the London market appears to have handled some pressures brought on by the crash better than New York. In particular, it says, the capital available immediately to market makers in London allowed them in the early stages of the crash to absorb substantial amounts of stock, while in New York a shortage of capital resources led to pressure on the so called specialist firms that ordinarily intervene to keep markets in individual shares orderly.

The great majority of the trade is in stones, mainly diamonds, with a few rich dealers, especially the Saudi Arabian Sheikh Ahmed Fitaihi, buying the most expensive stones, including the Dollars 11.88m he paid for a 100 carat diamond at Sotheby's in November. Most of the buyers are Arabs, followed by Chinese and Latin Americans, and there is an undoubted investment element behind the competition of the last two years. But high prices for stones has a knock on effect on jewellery.

For this reason producer sales are often tied to the fixing price and many central banks use a fixing average in revaluing their gold holdings. The actual amount of business done at the fixings remains a secret, though some traders feel that, in the interest of market transparency, daily volume figures should be published.

It's life in the fast lane for a road crew given 24 days to complete a repaving project that usually would take more than three months.

They really started moving when that gun went off, Foren said.

Keepers of the Doomsday Clock say the world is moving drastically away from the threat of nuclear war. For years the Doomsday Clock on the cover of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has been ticking back and forth toward midnight, an indication of the state of superpower relations. After standing at six minutes before midnight or the threat of nuclear war for two years, the Bulletin's April edition may turn the clock back, reflecting recent reforms in the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies.

A pioneering project synchronizing Los Angeles County traffic lights with the U.S. atomic clock in Boulder, Colo., is expected to save southern Californians thousands of hours of driving time a year, and sharply cut fuel use and pollution. By tapping the precision of the official U.S. timekeeping device, county officials say they can improve the timing of stoplights on major roads to allow traffic to flow more smoothly at posted speeds. The current five year, $13 million plan covers 1,020 intersections along 43 of the county's busiest thoroughfares, or about half of those for which it is responsible.
