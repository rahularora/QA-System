Pop singer Julian Lennon made $450,000 on the sale of the mountaintop home, a former Army building that he bought just 10 months ago, according to a published report.

Set in Los Angeles in the 1920s and '30s, the film tells how Gonzalez was paroled after being sent to San Quentin on trumped up rape charges following his advocacy broadcasts. Gonzalez parlayed his musical talents and eye for business into a popular Spanish language radio program. But it ended when he was sent to prison on charges that were later recanted by the woman who had allegedly been raped.

It's fitting the little statue labeled St. Expedite should end up at Our Lady of Guadeloupe. The old Roman Catholic church on the edge of the French Quarter with its shrine to St. Jude has long been a haven to the homeless, the helpless and many of life's misfits. On a bright spring morning a young man kneels in prayer at the altar, an elderly woman lights a candle at the statue of St. Jude, and an old man in ragged clothes sits in a patch of sunlight by the door, his shopping bags around his feet.

Federal judges may be disqualified from presiding over cases even when they are unaware during trial of their personal connection to the cases, the Supreme Court ruled today. In a 5 4 ruling in a case from Louisiana, the court said the appearance of a conflict of interest is grounds for a judge to disqualify himself from presiding. Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said even if a judge is unaware of a possible conflict while presiding over a case he later should disqualify himself when he learns of his connection.
