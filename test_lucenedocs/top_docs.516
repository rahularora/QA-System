North American has offered $20.50 a share for Butler, a Montvale, N.J., aviation services company. At the time the offer was announced, Mario Gabelli, chairman of the New York based investment company, expressed disappointment with the offer and said he would try to find another bid for Butler. North American, a holding company whose interests include a leather goods concern, paid $19.25 a share in cash for the Gabelli holding, about 15% of the Butler's shares outstanding.

Thieves burglarized the offices of the U.S. attorney for eastern Virginia, who has been conducting a highly publicized investigation into allegations of defense contracting fraud at the Pentagon. About six suites of a commercial office building in Alexandria, Va., across the Potomac River from Washington, were broken into sometime between 9:30 p.m. Sunday and 6 a.m. Monday, Dennis Butler, a spokesman for the Alexandria Police Department, said Tuesday. Butler said it appeared that the burglars entered the building through an unlocked door and punched holes through the gypsum board walls to gain access to the offices, which included the suites of U.S. Attorney Henry E. Hudson and a private law firm.

a tragicomic monologue by an idealistic, not unheroic, though sadly self deceived English butler in his sixties proceeds as if the realistic English novel of manners, like Britannia herself, still ruled the waves. In fact, Kazuo Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day (Knopf, 245 pages, $18.95) is both an homage to traditional English forms and a dramatic critique of them. It implies that the British Empire was rooted in its subjects' minds, manners and morals, and argues, tacitly, that its self destructive flaws were embodied in the defensive snobbery, willful blindness, role playing and especially the locutions of its domestic servants.

Mr. Ishiguro's ability to create a fallible narrative voice that permits him to explore such intertwining domestic, cultural and political themes was abundantly clear in his previous novel, An Artist of the Floating World, set in Japan after the war. Now shifting his scene from the country he left at five to the England he has lived in for nearly 30 years, he has fashioned a novel in the mode of Henry James and E.M. Forster. With great aplomb he considers not only filial devotion and (utterly repressed) sexual love, but British anti Semitism, the gentry's impatience with democracy and support of Hitler, and the moral problematics of loyalty: It is, in practice, simply not possible to adopt such a critical attitude towards an employer and at the same time provide good service.

For 15 aspiring butlers, drawing a gun will be as important as drawing a bath. The would be servants will be taking a three day course on handlng guns so they can protect employers and their families in the United States and other overseas posts. Unfortunately, we're living in an era of violence, and wealthy people overseas who employ butlers want somebody who in an emergency can go to a drawer and fire a gun to protect them and their families, said Ivor Spencer, who runs the International School for Butler Administrators.

TWO OF the oldest UK machine tool builders, Asquith and Butler, are being merged into one company by their new owner to create a strong force in one of the most competitive industrial product markets. Marbaix Lapointe, the machine tool side of Marbaix (Holdings), a family owned Basingstoke based concern, has combined the two companies, both based in Halifax, to form Asquith Butler. The Asquith site will close and the entire company will move on to the nearby Butler site.

A Miami couple who survived 66 days aboard a life raft in the Pacific Ocean returned home Saturday looking for a long rest away from the water and their aquatic tormentors. William Butler, 59, and Simone Butler, 56, arrived at Miami International Airport after a seven week ordeal, during which they said their boat was sunk by whales and they had to fend off sharks and subsist on fresh fish and desalinated sea water. The couple, each more than 50 pounds lighter after the ordeal, flew from San Jose, Costa Rica, a week after they were rescued by a Costa Rican Coast Guard cutter 13 miles off that Central American nation's coast.

Another skinhead is accused of stabbing a black man in Spokane, Wash. Swastikas painted on synagogues and assaults on Jews, homosexuals and other minorities have additionally been linked to skinheads in the region. Butler is not alone in courting skinheads. He's competing with groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and the White Aryan Resistance, led by Tom Metzger in Fallbrook, Calif. Until now, skinhead groups have been mostly autonomous and localized, Stern said.

They are weak, but they are expected to recover, said Vallecillo, who spoke to Butler by telephone from the U.S. Coast Guard's Pacific Command headquarters in Alameda, 10 miles east of San Francisco. Butler told Coast Guard officials their boat was attacked and sunk by several whales about 1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica. They were large, according to Mr. Butler; but he didn't know how many whales, Vallecillo said.
