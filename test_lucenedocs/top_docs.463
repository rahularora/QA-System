Johnson, 35, first hit the Austin music scene in the 1970s at age 15, mystifying musicians with his electric guitar mastery that evoked images of rock revolutionary Jimi Hendrix. The late Stevie Ray Vaughan was among those awed by his talent. Vaughan once said that by the time Johnson reached his late teens, he was so advanced it was difficult for him to find musicians to keep up with him.

I've also got a guitar authenticated as having been used by Hendrix, but I don't dare exhibit that because it's worth from $15,000 to $25,000, Voss said. That particular model of electric guitar from those years (a Fender Stratocaster) would bring $2,500 in its own right now, but the value goes up tenfold if it can be proved that Jimi touched it. Hendrix touched a lot of guitars during his last years.

That's when he would smash his instrument at the climax of a performance, douse it with lighter fluid and leave the stage with the guitar lying in feedback shrieking flames.

But his cornucopia of near continuous soloing became, after a while, too much of a good thing. Confronted with so much sound streaming from Trout's guitar, one began to long for space and spareness, the eloquence of the pauses between notes.

For more than a decade he has been tirelessly offering his vision of what rock 'n' roll should be direct, human and as stripped of the hyped up volume and trappings of arena as possible and the effort has paid off. Performed with an alarming earnestness, even his lyrics about chewing gum wrappers or Greyhound bus trips become a challenge to touch the intensity in each moment of life. </P> <P> Saturday, his short set offered odes to heroes as divergent as Vincent Van Gogh, whose paintings had those colors because he loved life so bad, and baseball great Walter Johnson, who, Richman's song explained, cared about people more than he cared about fame.

Speaking of Daniel Lanois, in 1989 the producer stepped in to help the Neville Brothers find their own voice on Yellow Moon, the group's most successful record, both commercially and artistically. This year the Nevilles, sans Lanois, have taken their sound a step further and the resulting recording, Brother's Keeper (A&amp;M), is their best work. By now, finally, Aaron Neville is a star and rightfully so: Aaronesque should be an adjective to describe a sweet, heart wrenching and perfect vocal performance.

Last year, the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame welcomed its first 10 inductees, big name performers like Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, James Brown, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, Little Richard and Ray Charles. Sam Phillips, founder of Sun Records, disk jockey Alan Freed, and three pre rock musicians who influenced rockers were also honored. The awards ceremony and the decision to construct a Hall of Fame building in Cleveland got big play, and the baby enterprise had a rousing start.
