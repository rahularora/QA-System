McFarland wants similar retroactive payments from the owner and former co owner of the St. Paul bar. He's after 5 percent of their gross profits for 13 years and that's an exorbitant amount of money, even if they did something wrong, said Dennis Johnson, a lawyer for the bar's former owner, Michael Kalis.

A bottlenose dolphin has become stranded in the chilly waters off Virginia Beach after failing to migrate south this fall, and authorities are planning a risky rescue to try to reunite it with its brethren. The dolphin, nicknamed Rascal, was spotted in early October in Broad Bay, and residents around the bay began requesting that the government do something to save it. On Monday, the National Marine Fisheries Service agreed that the animal's life was in jeopardy and that an attempt should be made to save it.

It was the election of our discontent, CBS correspondent Bruce Morton said in the early going, before the nation's dreaded anti incumbency mood stopped short of actually ousting any major rascals. It had fewer commercials.

Thanks to Astrid's Law, dogs' tails in Sweden are safe from cosmetic trimming and barnyard animals are guaranteed a better life, at least until they get to the slaughterhouse. The law, which took effect July 1, was the result of a campaign by children's author Astrid Lindgren, creator of Pippi Longstocking and a host of other characters who have enchanted children in dozens of countries. It was a remarkable achievement, even for a woman who once helped bring down a government.

However, this was a trick to deceive the South Korean people. The chieftain of the civilian regime has not separated itself from the Fifth and Sixth Republics but are colluding with them.

Betting wise, the World Cup has not proved my finest hour, writes Michael Thompson Noel. No bookmakers have topped themselves as a result of my bets, which is always the bonus I savour most. I got over heated to start with; then slowed to a crawl; and was finally flattened by queasiness at the sight of Brazil's shrinking odds.
