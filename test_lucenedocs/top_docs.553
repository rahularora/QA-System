So it is with high hopes but a healthy dose of caution that toy makers will give more than 10,000 toy buyers a peek into their bags of new toys at the American International Toy Fair that begins today in New York. There will be lots to see: dolls that dance at the flash of a camera; Toxic Crusaders, one of many toys that seek to cash in on the environmental movement; a play photo copier that reproduces texts and, presumably, other children's homework; an electronic easel that can be hooked to the television to make home made cartoons out of kids' drawings; and a parade of other toys, including Miss America Pageant dolls that the reigning Miss America will personally promote at the show. But the 10 day gala glimpse of toys to come embellished with sales spiels, previews of TV commercials and spiffy show girls will offer few clues to whether the industry can break out after four years of flat sales.

THE merger with Fisher Price will transform Mattel, the number two US toy maker, into a worthy rival to industry leader Hasbro, swelling Mattel's market share from 11 per cent to 15 per cent, just short of Hasbro's 16 per cent share. The next biggest company is Tyco, accounting for 5 per cent of the market, according to Mr Gary Jacobson, analyst at Kidder Peabody.
