The detoxicating activity of polymyxin B relative to the plague microbe toxin and the efficacy of a combination of antibiotics in starting treatment of experimental plague in albino mice 48 h after infection are summarized. The study shows that polymyxin has a detoxicating effect and facilitates albino mice survival at the early plague intoxication stage; this is attributed to the ability of polymyxin B to inhibit the biological activity of lipopolysachharide in the external membrane of gram negative bacteria.

A vaccine that makes the body attack sperm was 100 percent effective in tests with female and male guinea pigs, the first demonstration of contraception without fail from a vaccine, scientists reported today. The study, which also found the effects of the vaccination temporary, raises the prospect that a similar vaccine might work in women and men. But there are many things about it that would have to be changed or improved to make it a useful method for either agricultural animals or humans, said researcher Paul Primakoff.

So to produce a human male vaccine, researchers would have to find a way to trigger just the antibodies without the rest of an immune system reaction, he said. No evidence indicates the guinea pig vaccine would work in humans, nor is there any assurance that human sperm contains a suitable protein target for a similar vaccine, he said. Richard Bronson, director of the reproductive endocrinology division at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, called the research very encouraging.

The 100 percent contraception rate makes the results really terrific, said Nancy Alexander, director of applied fundamental research for the Contraceptive Research and Development Program at the Jones Institute of Reproductive Medicine in Norfolk, Va. A vaccine that prevents fertilization might avoid religious and cultural implications of another kind of vaccine that has already begun preliminary human testing, she said.

A Utah congressman appealed to a House panel Wednesday to approve a $100 million trust fund to pay damages to forgotten guinea pigs of the West whose health was destroyed by radiation from government uranium mines and atomic bomb tests. Rep. Wayne Owens, D Utah, said several victims or their survivors won federal suits in which the judges concluded the federal government was negligent, only to have the decisions overturned on appeal because of a law that protects the government from being sued except in the rarest of instances. Republican Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, who is sponsoring the legislation in the Senate, said the cost will amount to only a fraction of what the downwinders and miners have spent because of the problems that the government his caused.

Standard Andean grasses, maize stalks or potato peelings, while convenient, do not produce what the locals term 'the giant cuy'.

Genoa port commissioner Giuseppe Francese said the guinea pigs will be lowered into the ship's holds to see if they suffer any toxic effects.

A young man whose body was used for a medical experiment while he was in a deep coma died on Sunday, family members said. The revelation last Tuesday that an anesthesiologist had performed an experiment on Pacal Louette, 24, considered at the time clinically dead, touched off a scandal about the ethics of using human beings as guinea pigs. Louette, injured in an auto accident earlier this year, died Sunday morning at Amiens North Hospital, his father in law, Emile Collard, said.

Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN [Text] Majuro, Jan 25 (AFP) Top Marshall Islands government officials have criticised what they say is the failure of the United States to release information about the effects of its nuclear test program here. Officials said they believed the lack of data had led to inadequate compensation being paid to Marshall Islanders. In the wake of US Department of Energy (DOE) admissions that US citizens were used as unwitting guinea pigs for nuclear experiments, Foreign Minister Tom Kijiner said Monday that the United States had failed to release full information about its nuclear test program in the Marshalls.

In so doing, the effect of water phenol, trichloracetic, and salt extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the delayed hypersensitivity of mice to the guinea pig antigen is studied. The study reveals that the salt extracts of the wild strains contain thermostable immunosuppressive factors of a lipid origin with a high mass (over 800 kD) which may be inactivated by trichloracetic acid and phenol.

Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN [Text] Majuro, Jan 25 (AFP) Top Marshall Islands government officials have criticised what they say is the failure of the United States to release information about the effects of its nuclear test program here. Officials said they believed the lack of data had led to inadequate compensation being paid to Marshall Islanders. In the wake of U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) admissions that U.S. citizens were used as unwitting guinea pigs for nuclear experiments, Foreign Minister Tom Kijiner said Monday that the United States had failed to release full information about its nuclear test program in the Marshalls.

Pascal Louette, 24, who went into a deep coma following an auto accident, died Sunday after Dr. Alain Milhaud placed him on a sabotaged medical device to see if the effects matched those of a similar case, currently the subject of a trial in Poitiers. Louette was considered clinically dead at the time of the experiment, which was performed at the Regional Hospital Center of Amiens.

But that sum is not likely to satisfy Marshallese victims who have filed civil suits seeking approximately $7 billion in compensation for death and illness suffered as a result of the 66 nuclear weapons detonations above Bikini and Eniwetok Atolls between 1946 and 1958.; Moreover, the United States has never fulfilled its commitment to make a serious effort to protect the health and safety of those weapons test victims. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that many of them have been used, without their knowledge or permission, as human guinea pigs by scientists and physicians employed by the federal government to study the effects of radiation exposure. ; A 1977 study of Bikini conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy concluded that radiation levels exceeded federal guidelines decades after the nuclear tests were concluded, but the department was unwilling to evacuate the atoll because it is possibly the best available source of data for evaluating the transfer of plutonium across the gut wall after being incorporated into biological systems.

A Justice Department official urged a House subcommittee on Friday to reject ill conceived legislation to compensate some cancer victims among southwestern uranium miners and people who lived downwind of 1950s U.S. atomic tests in Nevada. The bill does not require that causation between exposure to radiation and cancer be established or that any legal theory of liability on the part of the United States be proven, said Steven Valentine, deputy assistant attorney general in the department's civil division. Valentine, restating opposition voiced by Justice officials for more than a decade, said the department does not believe a link has been proven between radiation and cancers in miners and people receiving fallout from the atmospheric weapons tests.

The government pinned the responsibility for the contamination of Times Beach and 16 other Missouri sites on Syntex Corp. One of its subsidiaries had bought a plant that had once supplied dioxin tainted waste oil to a contractor who had sprayed it on the streets of Times Beach and the other sites. After years of costly litigation, Syntex signed a consent decree a year ago agreeing to clean up the sites and incinerate some 100,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil. Cost estimates run as much as $200 million over the next decade.

Two animal welfare groups have sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture to try to force officials to regulate treatment of laboratory rats, mice and birds. In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, the Humane Society of the United States and the Animal Legal Defense Fund claim that the department misused its discretion in excluding rats, mice and birds from the protection of the Animal Welfare Act. The two groups filed a petition with the department last year, formally asking for regulations to cover rats, mice and birds.

Owing to the fact that Mozambique virus is not pathogenic to man or monkeys, some researchers feel that Mozambique virus is a candidate for use in the preparation of a live vaccine designed to prevent Lassa fever. Before that can be done, however, convincing evidence must be produced to the effect that the virus is definitely not pathogenic to man, and it must be certain that the virus would not persist in the human body.

She said annual reports and letters to consumers say Avon puts out 90 percent of its formulas without testing on animals.

PRISONS: The government yesterday agreed to a narrower definition of the proposed new offence of prison mutiny, as the prison security bill progressed through its final Commons stages, David Owen writes. The move followed Labour claims that the original wording could have resulted in prisoners engaged in peaceful protests about minor issues being charged with the offence, which will carry a maximum sentence of 10 years. The revised bill states that mutiny occurs when two or more prisoners 'engage in conduct which is intended to further a common purpose of overthrowing lawful authority in that prison.

THE humble cowpea plant is nurturing a potentially far reaching medical advance which could help prevent Aids and other infectious diseases. The plant, which produces the black eyed bean, is being used to produce animal and human vaccines. The first experimental vaccines, against foot and mouth disease and Aids, are growing in a greenhouse at the John Innes Centre in Norwich.

Dorothy Spangenberg's laboratory is jammed with 20,000 jellyfish four times more than usual because of NASA's delay in launching the space shuttle Columbia. The biologist from Eastern Virginia Medical School plans to send 2,700 tiny, young jellyfish on a research mission to study their metamorphosis in a gravity free environment. Originally scheduled for August, it was pushed into 1991 when the shuttle sprung hydrogen leaks.

The American Medical Association today urged doctors to take a more active role in their communities to ensure fairness in the debate over the use of animals in research. In a commentary in the Journal of the AMA, the association cautioned that erosion of public support for the use of research animals poses as great a threat as pending legislation or regulatory efforts. When people are given the entire picture, when they're reminded that research animals played a crucial role in the development of vaccines ... and heart transplants and antibiotics, there is clearly backing for this position, said William Hendee, AMA vice president for science and technology.

Scientists have found specialized nerve sites where a natural pain causing substance attaches itself, adding evidence that the substance plays a key role in the body's perception of pain. Molecules of the substance, bradykinin, bound to the nerve sites in experiments with dog and guinea pig nerve tissue, scientists said in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Bradykinin is released from bodily tissues when they are injured.

The head of an animal rights group says she's not impressed by a poll which found that 77 percent of Americans believe medical progress depends on the use of animals in research. It's hardly an unbiased survey, I must say, said Ingrid Newkirk, director of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Ms. Newkirk considers the poll, commissioned by the American Medical Association, a public relations ploy, saying the money could have been put to greater use by improving the living conditions of laboratory animals.

Volunteers from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, clad in hooded black robes representing the grim reapers of companies they say slaughter rabbits, carried a bloodied toy rabbit in a satin coffin and shouted, Have a cruelty free holiday! The 20 PETA protesters marched outside the headquarters of the 270 member Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association in downtown Washington, but police did not allow them to enter the building.
