Federal tax law changes helped cause a 23 percent drop in sales of public partnerships last year, an industry group reported Thursday. Investors poured $10.5 billion into tax saving limited partnerships last year, compared with a record $13.5 billion in 1987, the Investment Partnership Association said. In a limited partnership, the liability of the limited partners in the business is limited to their capital contribution.

The nascent limited partnership secondary market will be allowed to grow under a notice of guidance to taxpayers issued by the Internal Revenue Service. The notice, a precursor to final regulations expected later this year, indicates that the IRS won't change the tax treatment of publicly registered limited partnerships or the income investors receive just because a dozen or so small investment firms buy and sell those interests. Several safe harbors in the notice exempt most limited partnerships from provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 that treat certain publicly traded master limited partnerships those listed on stock exchanges as corporations.

John Provine, managing general partner of August Real Estate Investment Inc. of Irvine, Calif., says his company quit making SEC reports last fall on all 10 of its public partnerships. They raised about $30 million from 2,000 investors. The cost of the filings ran anywhere from $50,000 to $150,000 per year per partnership, he says.

Two oil and gas master limited partnerships yesterday proposed returning to a traditional corporate structure, signaling widespread disenchantment with the once popular oil and gas partnerships. Citing the high costs of preparing and filing tax data for unit holders, Apache Petroleum Co. L.P. of Denver and Devon Resource Investors of Oklahoma City, Okla., said they will ask holders to swap their units for common shares in related companies. Analysts said the move reflects frustration with the limited partnership structure at a time when oil and gas prices have remained stubbornly low.

The partnerships in the survey are a small sample of the nearly $90 billion of such investments sold publicly by major Wall Street brokerage firms and other syndicators since the late 1970s.

In a roll up, several non traded limited partnerships, typically including some healthy ones and some that aren't, are consolidated into new, publicly traded investments.

Genentech Inc., despite strong sales and operating profit growth, posted big fourth quarter and full year losses, as expected, because of a $365 million charge. The charge stems from buying back product rights from its first two research and development limited partnerships. The repurchase aims to boost Genentech's bottom line by preserving 100% of future profit from three important products: human growth hormone for treating dwarfism; gamma interferon, an experimental cancer fighter; and tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, a clot dissolver treatment for heart attacks.

For all the fame gained by Integrated Resources some years back as a seller of hot real estate tax shelters, the track record of 13 partnerships that Integrated sold publicly between 1971 and 1983 has been something less than sizzling. That record is displayed in the prospectus for Integrated's plan to roll all 13 partnerships into one master limited partnership, American Real Estate Partners L.P., that will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Integrated forecasts that the $297 million move will be the first of many like it in the industry, now that the new tax law has rung down the curtain on property values artificially swollen by depreciation rules.

Prices of many of them have outpaced the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index by a considerable margin, and yields have been measured in double digits. But while there are still some rich opportunities for selective buyers, investment professionals say, the sharp run up in prices, changes in the nature of the market and emerging problems with some individual partnerships present serious pitfalls for the average investor.

Even before the stock market crash, nervous investors were accepting the relative illiquidity of real estate partnerships to lock in yields of 7% to 8% close to those on 10 year to 15 year Treasury securities plus the chance for capital appreciation. In the wake of the crash, many syndicators are reporting higher sales, says Roulac Real Estate Consulting Group. The limited partnership does what we've always said it does: reduce volatility, says Christopher Davis, president of the Investment Partnership Association, a Washington based trade group.

Like many investors, Tulsa, Okla., businessman Paul Shindell paid little attention to the fine print when he bought into a horse breeding limited partnership two years ago. One of the provisions he overlooked gave investors only 15 days to respond to any changes proposed by Kinderhill Corp., the general partner. Thus, last fall when Kinderhill proposed a reorganization that Mr. Shindell and a number of other investors didn't like, they found themselves struggling against the clock.
