It was one of only six public engagements she has scheduled until March, according to Buckingham Palace's official list. The Sunday Times of London, which usually does not focus on the private lives of the royal family, said the duchess was suffering from a general cooling in relations between the palace and the media. The chill is largely due to the royal family's failure to attend a memorial service in Lockerbie, Scotland, for victims of the Dec. 21 crash of Pan Am Flight 103, and the decision to send Prince Philip to the funeral of Japan's Emperor Hirohito.

Britain on Tuesday celebrated the birth of a princess with two 41 gun salutes, a new cocktail and heavy betting on her name. Prince Andrew, saying it was wonderful to be a father, showered the women in his life with roses and carnations reportedly choosing red for his red haired wife, Sarah, and pink for his day old daughter, the couple's first child and the fifth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II. The daughter of the Duchess of York is a beautiful baby with elegant hands and a petite little face ... just fit for a princess, said the duchess' sister, Jane Makim, who lives in Australia and received a phone call from her mother, Susan Barrantes, after the birth.

A sales executive with a graphic arts publishing company when she married, she had led a free and independent life that included a three year romance with motor racing figure Paddy McNally, a widower with two sons. Robust, athletic and outspoken, Sarah was far from the slim, demure and impeccably groomed English rose that Princess Diana, wife of Prince Charles, typified. She kept working after her marriage, and although she had given up her publishing job by early 1988, she planned to do free lance work.

The Daily Mirror and other British tabloids have risen to the defense of the Duchess of York, criticizing American designer Richard Blackwell for having the barefaced cheek to put her on his worst dressed list. The Mirror said Tuesday that Blackwell was so sensitive about his own precious looks that he's had them rearranged four times. Blackwell had hit out at the former Sarah Ferguson in a preview of his list of the world's 10 worst dressed women, saying she has none of the style of her sister in law Princess Diana, that she looks as if she makes beds in Ireland or milks cows, and that she walks like a duck with a bad leg.

Queen Elizabeth II and her family got a pay increase in Tuesday's annual budget of 4.6 percent, which was lower than inflation but still means they will cost the taxpayers $10.6 million. The increase of 273,000 pounds ($466,800) brought the total to 6,195,300 pounds ($10,594,000), and was too much for some Labor Party legislators whatever its relation to the cost of living. For the royal family, it looks as though Christmas has come early, Labor member Max Madden said in the House of Commons.

Sarah, the Duchess of York, better known as Fergie, has received a scolding from a suburban Chicago dermatologist who contends her visits to a tanning parlor set a bad example. The former Sarah Ferguson who is married to Britain's Prince Andrew is especially prone to sun damage because of her fair complexion and Celtic ancestry, said Dr. Michael Greenberg.
