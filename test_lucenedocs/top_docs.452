The relationship between Disney and Henson dates to 1989, when the Hollywood studio tentatively agreed to acquire the Henson film library and the rights to some of Henson's most popular characters, including Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog, in a deal valued at Dollars 150m. But the arrangement started to fall apart after Jim Henson's untimely death last year, thoughnegotiations for a licensing agreement covering a Muppet movie due to open on May 4 and a Muppet stage show continued until this month.

THE LEGAL squabbling between Walt Disney and the makers of the Muppets ended yesterday when both sides 'amicably resolved' their differences and reached an out of court settlement which will allow Disney to exhibit two Muppet attractions at its Orlando, Florida theme park. The altercation started nearly two weeks ago when Henson Associates, a family run company founded by the late Jim Henson, filed a suit accusing Disney of violating copyrights and trademarks of the Muppets. A Disney spokesman expressed deep regret for what was described as a serious misunderstanding, and apologised to the Henson family and their company for any harm that may have been caused.

At first glance, the reunion seems bizarre, because the breakup of Disney's planned purchase of Henson last year was so ugly and so public. An angry exchange of lawsuits and press interviews saw each side accusing the other of greed and bad faith, and the episode quickly turned into a public relations fiasco for both companies. Though some joint projects between the two companies continued such as the TV show Dinosaurs and a Muppets 3 D film at Walt Disney World many industry executives and analysts believed it would be impossible for the two to overcome their acrimony.

Though some joint projects between the two companies continued such as the TV show Dinosaurs and a Muppets 3 D film at Walt Disney World many industry executives and analysts believed it would be impossible for the two to overcome their acrimony. But individuals close to the companies said Los Angeles based Henson was upset with some of Disney's corporate executives, not with its operational people in theme parks, television and home video.
