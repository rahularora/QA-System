Tele Communications Inc.'s plan to spin off a new company to handle its programming interests will help it deal with possible regulatory constraints and to continue to grow, industry analysts said Friday. TCI is the nation's largest cable system operator and also has extensive interests in cable programming, including a 22 percent stake in Turner Broadcasting System Inc. On Thursday, John Malone, TCI's chief executive officer, said the TCI board authorized management to develop a plan to form and distribute to shareholders a new company that would contain its programming interests, its minority interest in some cable systems and other cable service businesses. The spinoff would create a new growth vehicle for TCI shareholders, unencumbered of potential regulatory constraints or conflicting objectives, he said.

Cable television operators are not stopping their viewers from seeing independent programming, according to a study released Thursday that was paid for by the operators. When cable companies hold financial stakes in program services such as Home Box Office, Showtime or MTV they don't try to keep their viewers from seeing non affiliated networks such as ESPN or USA, the study said. These large cable operators also don't refuse to license their program services to competing delivery systems such as microwave and backyard satellite dishes, according to the study by Benjamin Klein, an economics professor at the University of California at Los Angeles.

At the request of MCA TV Group President Robert Harris, whose company owns Universal Television Productions, Cownie organized a group of executives from the country's 30 largest cable companies to talk with Spielberg, Miami Vice executive producer Michael Mann and other producers about a joint programming venture.

SHARES in Liberty Media, a cable television programming company, rose strongly yesterday amid Wall Street speculation that its former parent, Tele Communications Inc, was in discussions to buy back the business. Such a move could have important repercussions on the takeover battle for Paramount Communications, since QVC Network, the television home shopping company making a hostile Dollars 9.5bn bid for Paramount, is 22.5 per cent owned by Liberty. The re acquisition would thus thrust TCI, a large and well financed company, much more directly into the battle for Paramount, and could give additional muscle to the bid by QVC, which is substantially smaller than Paramount.

Such a move could have important repercussions on the takeover battle for Paramount Communications, since QVC Network, the television home shopping company making a hostile Dollars 9.5bn bid for Paramount, is 22.5 per cent owned by Liberty. The re acquisition would thus thrust TCI, a large and well financed company, much more directly into the battle for Paramount, and could give additional muscle to the bid by QVC, which is substantially smaller than Paramount. The QVC bid is contending against a smaller, Dollars 7.5bn agreed bid for Paramount from Viacom, the cable television company best known for its MTV pop music channel.

Such agreements must be renewed every two to three years, and affiliates worry that NBC might not renew such pacts if a cable system becomes an affiliate particularly if the cable system doesn't charge the network for carrying it. NBC stressed it won't make any moves that might harm affiliates. We would not do anything that was not advantageous to our affiliates, said an NBC spokesman.

In his letter to Mr. Wright, Mr. Malone noted that many rural cities and towns don't receive any local news, because they are reliant on stations imported from other cities, which are naturally inclined to give events happening in their city of license overwhelming priority.

The Morganton local government has been locked in a six year battle with TCI over the Denver company's Morganton cable system. City officials attempted to evict TCI in 1986, refusing to renew its cable franchise because of alleged service lapses. TCI sued Morganton for $35 million in federal court but lost the case, while continuing to operate in the town.

Bell Atlantic and Tele Communications Inc scuppered what was to have been the biggest merger in the history of the US telecommunications industry solely because of the Federal Communications Commission's action, this week, to lower cable television rates by 7 per cent, the companies said. The FCC's action lowered the anticipated cashflow of TCI, the largest US cable television service company, by about Dollars 144m (Pounds 98.6m) a year, said Mr John Malone, TCI president. This cut the valuation placed on TCI by Bell Atlantic by about Dollars 2bn, or Dollars 3.30 per share, he said.

Over the next few years, households will be able to call up on a television set a vast array of information and entertainment, together with video telephone calls although it remains uncertain how much consumers are ready to pay for this. Both the telephone and cable television industries have wires running into most US homes. The convergence of the two sectors at one time looked like provoking a furious battle, but instead the two are getting together.

Tele Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable television system operator, reported Wednesday it lost $257 million last year, citing expenses linked to the financing of acquisitions. The net loss for the year that ended Dec. 31 was equal to 73 cents per share, compared with net earnings of $56 million, or 15 cents per share, in 1988, the company said in a news release. The decrease of $313 million was primarily due to decreased gain on sales of assets, increased interest expense incurred to finance certain acquisitions, the increase in depreciation and amortization resulting from those acquisitions, and TCI's increased pro rata share of losses of affiliates, TCI said in a news release.
