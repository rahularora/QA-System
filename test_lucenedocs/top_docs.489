You might have to haul it home on the back of a flatbed truck, but if you assemble enough of the junkers you can put together a racecar. And, best of all, there is no shortage of rusty heaps from which to choose; Ford built more than a million before taking the car off the market. Every junkyard has 100, David Bowers, one of the first to race Pintos, says happily.

A wind whipped forest fire burned more than 10,000 acres in the isolated mountains of central Pennsylvania on Sunday before crews brought it under control near the banks of the Susquehanna River. The fire started Saturday morning in the Sproul State Forest and moved north in warm, dry weather, authorities said. The fire burned a swath roughly three miles wide and eight miles long to within several hundred yards of the Susquehanna's west branch, where it was brought under control Sunday afternoon, said Susan Woods, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Resources.

Law enforcers say John J. Gotti's indictment could mean a promotion for his son John, whom they describe as a quick fisted, barrel chested Mafia prince with more brawn than brains. Because most of the top men in the Gambino crime family are under indictment, behind bars, or both, Gotti could very well try to run the family through his son, Jules Bonalovonta, the FBI's organized crime expert in New York, said in an interview last month. Well, nothing could please us more, he said.

Interior Secretary Donald Hodel may go down in history as the only Machiavelli in Ronald Reagan's court. A few months ago Mr. Hodel suggested that the wearing of wide brim hats, neckerchiefs and other devices for protection against strong sunlight would greatly reduce the millions of deaths due to skin cancer that had been forecast to result from destruction of the ozone layer above Earth by chlorofluorocarbons. It was a sound suggestion and one that Mexican peasants, Arab sheiks, Wyoming cowboys, Argentine gauchos, Australian sheepherders, Chesapeake Bay crabbers, and farmers all over the world have been following for a long time.

Democrat Theo Mitchell is making scant headway in his bid to become the nation's second black elected governor, and some South Carolina Democrats complain the candidate has done little to help himself. Mitchell's campaign also has had to compete for attention with a statehouse bribery scandal that so far has brought the indictments of five state legislators. The only issue anyone wants to talk about is ethics, said Lynn Stokes, a veteran of other Democratic campaigns.

Memorial Day is a day of reflection, of being extremely disappointed in the heart and mind ... and of thinking ... how much I wish I could close the book on my father, said Robin Powers, 28, of Orion Township, Mich., outside Detroit.

The city and a group of parents told a judge today that retarded people living at home are likely to backslide in their skills because the state cut off money for workshops, training and other services. The plaintiffs asked a Commonwealth Court judge to restore $7.9 million cut June 30 from programs that benefit 7,750 retarded people living at home. Unless the aid is restored, thousands of retarded people may be forced into institutions against their families' wishes in order to get help, the city has charged.

The ethics case against House Speaker Jim Wright dominates Capitol Hill conversation, but lawmakers found out over the weekend that folks back home have other things on their minds. Wright's chief accuser, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R Ga., used town meetings in his suburban Atlanta district to cite repeatedly from the House ethics committee report charging Wright with 69 violations. That was fine, said Bob Norton, a Douglas county real estate broker.
