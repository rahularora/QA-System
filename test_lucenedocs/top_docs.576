 WSJ870212-0147 
Paul Schrader assembled almost all the right ingredients for Light of Day, the rock melodrama he wrote and directed a girl rebelling against a religious fanatic mom; an illegitimate child; incestuous impulses between a brother and a sister; a working class rock band; and a title song by Bruce Springsteen. He didn't skimp on the cast either: Gena Rowlands, rock star Joan Jett, teen idol Michael J. Fox.

A judge dismissed a $6.5 million libel lawsuit in which rock star Joan Jett claimed Playboy magazine hurt her reputation by mistakenly identifying her as a woman posing seductively in a bathtub. State Judge Eugene Nardelli threw out the lawsuit after Jett twice failed to appear for court ordered depositions with Playboy lawyers, the New York Post reported today. The photograph appeared in Playboy's May 1982 issue.

State Judge Eugene Nardelli threw out the lawsuit after Jett twice failed to appear for court ordered depositions with Playboy lawyers, the New York Post reported today. The photograph appeared in Playboy's May 1982 issue. After Jett filed the lawsuit, the magazine printed a correction, and the Retna Photo Agency, which supplied the picture, destroyed it.

Levine and the orchestra do themselves proud. The sound is always smooth and sonorous and the interpretation is quite moving at the climactic moments, especially Wotan's eloquent farewell to the disgraced Bruennhilde in Act 3. The orchestra, widely regarded as one of the world's finest ensembles, had not recorded a home grown production for 16 years, since Bizet's Carmen with Leonard Bernstein conducting.

Neptune's poles may be encircled by broad bands of dark clouds blown by jet streams like those on Earth and Jupiter, say scientists studying a new photograph from the Voyager 2 space probe. Two dark bands, each about 2,700 miles wide, are clearly visible forming a collar around Neptune's south pole. The photograph also shows hints of similar banding around the north pole, said Edward Stone, Voyager project scientist for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The huge American flag has been replaced with tapestries of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. And Bruce Springsteen has shed his bandana and work boots for the less proletarian look of a boardwalk carny in his first return to the road since 1985. But appearance is the least of the unexpected twists and turns provided by the rock star on his Tunnel of Love Express Tour, the 22 city show that opened Feb. 25 at the Centrum in Worcester.

The illegitimate daughter of the late Hank Williams Sr. should share in the country music legacy of lucrative songwriting royalties, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. The court, in a 5 2 decision, said Cathy Deupree Adkinson can share in the income, interest and copyright royalties estimated to be worth more than $500,000 a year from the time she filed her initial claim on Aug. 5, 1985. The court said Mrs. Adkinson's interests were not properly represented when Williams' estate was settled 21 years ago.

Highway 101 hasn't sold 15 million albums like Fleetwood Mac's Rumours, but the energy of its music and the vocals of Paulette Carlson have drawn comparisons to Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie.

The regulatory action, which will end the manufacture of most asbestos products in three phases over the next seven years, was expected to be announced by the Environmental Protection Agency today. According to government and private sources who spoke on condition they not be identified, the agency action will allow asbestos to be a component in only a small number of items, prohibiting its use over the next seven years in an estimated 94 percent of the products in which it currently can be found.

An outbreak of rapidly fatal bacterial infections in at least four western states could mark the return of dangerous strains of strep germs that mysteriously disappeared almost 50 years ago, researchers reported today. The newly recognized illness, which doctors call streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, can lead from a minor skin infection to death in a day or two. Strep germs are common but usually result in relatively minor illnesses, such as sore throats.

Neptune's poles may be encircled by broad bands of dark clouds blown by jet streams like those on Earth and Jupiter, say scientists studying a new photograph from the Voyager 2 space probe. Two dark bands, each about 2,700 miles wide, are clearly visible forming a collar around Neptune's south pole. The photograph also shows hints of similar banding around the north pole, said Edward Stone, Voyager project scientist for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
