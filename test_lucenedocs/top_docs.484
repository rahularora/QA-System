The US entertainment giant got off to a nice start this week when a Saudi Arabian prince swept to the rescue of Euro Disney, its financially troubled French theme park associate. Desert themes were already much on the mind of Mr Michael Eisner, Walt Disney's chairman: the company has just released a low budget sequel to its hit animated movie 'Aladdin' directly into the US video market bypassing cinemas and this follow up, called the 'Return of Jafar', is proving a big hit.

Wired, the super hip technology magazine, regularly carries a recruitment advertisement from Walt Disney, the entertainment group, bearing the slogan: 'If you're good with a mouse, we've got great people, cool hardware and big challenges in advanced computer graphics'. It seems very likely that future issues of Wired could carry a similar advertisement from Disney's latest competitor the new entertainment group being launched by Jeffrey Katzenberg, who recently resigned as head of Disney's movie studios, Steven Spielberg, the Oscar winning film director, and David Geffen, the billionaire music mogul. The new group, like Disney itself, will be anxious to attract the cream of the new breed of technology buffs if it is to achieve its ambition of becoming a force in feature films and animation.

The continued runaway success of Walt Disney's new and classic animated films helped the US entertainment group shrug off lower theme park attendances to post a slight improvement in third quarter profits, to Dollars 267.5m, or 49 cents a share. In the same period a year ago, the group earned Dollars 259.1m, or 48 cents. The results, which came in above Wall Street analysts' forecasts, were welcome news for the company, whose fortunes have suffered recently from the death in April of Mr Frank Wells, president, and the sudden incapacitation of Mr Michael Eisner, the chairman, who underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery 10 days ago.

This year is rapidly shaping up to be Walt Disney's 'annus horribilus'. In the past eight months, the US entertainment group has endured a string of setbacks. They have included: the loss of the company's highly regarded president, Mr Frank Wells, in a helicopter accident in April; the temporary incapacitation, following emergency heart bypass surgery, of its chairman, Mr Michael Eisner; a politically embarrassing tussle with historians over plans to build a new Disney theme park near Civil War battlefields in Virginia; another costly financial reorganisation of Euro Disney and declining attendance at its US theme parks; and a series of disappointing performances from its live action (as opposed to animated) movies.

The advantages of the link with Blockbuster, Devereux says, are the marketing muscle it will give VIE and the size of the US company's distribution network: 4,250 shops worldwide.

Hollywood was shocked by the recent announcement that Sony, the Japanese electronics group, had fallen into the red in the first half of this year after making a Y265bn (Pounds 1.7bn) write off on its US film interests. Sony apart, 1994 has been a good year for the industry on the revenue front. The US box office has taken more than Dollars 4.5bn so far this year against Dollars 4.35bn in the same period of 1993, according to Variety, the industry magazine.

In his last film, School Daze, Columbia Pictures' biggest grosser for 1988, Lee was strident and polemical in his treatment of racial issues. But in Do the Right Thing, he allows the movie itself to unravel and define bigotry. The theme for the movie's title comes from a speech made by the late black activist Malcolm X in December 1964: Racism is a human problem and a crime that is absolutely so ghastly that a person who is fighting racism is well within his rights to fight against it by any means necessary until it is eliminated.

Amid general optimism about the summer season, the movie industry is buzzing with two big questions: Will Paramount Pictures rake in even more at the box office with Beverly Hills Cop II than with the original? And will Columbia Pictures be raked over the coals with the costly Ishtar ? Summer, which typically provides 40% of the industry's annual take at the box office, is long this year, with Memorial Day a week earlier than usual and Labor Day a week later.

English playwright Tom Stoppard's debut movie Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead received the top prize Saturday at the 47th Venice Film Festival amid boos and whistles from some of the media. The film, starring actor Richard Dreyfuss, reinterprets Shakespeare's Hamlet from the point of view of the prince's two old school chums, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who become unwittingly involved in the power play between Hamlet and his stepfather. Stoppard's 1966 play by the same name was a hit, but the film was not predicted to take the Golden Lion prize despite favorable reviews.

The Lion King, Walt Disney's latest animated epic, opened last week in the UK with all the hype of a film that has already taken US box offices by storm. Like each new Disney release, the latest extravaganza is packed with ground breaking techniques to captivate audiences and animators alike. While The Lion King, by most accounts, reinforces Disney's position as the world's pre eminent animator, a small UK company, Cambridge Animation Systems, hopes it has developed new software that will dramatically change the way many cartoons are made.

As a result, many animators ship work to studios in the Philippines, Vietnam and China where there is a significant labour cost advantage but where control of the process and quality is greatly reduced. Animo says its product will remove the cost disadvantage and increase quality, helping to repatriate animation work to Europe. The Animo software is being assessed by Nelvana of Canada and Warner Feature Films, which are about to computerise parts of their animation studios.

English playwright Tom Stoppard's debut movie, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, captured the top prize today at the Venice Film Festival. The film, starring Richard Dreyfuss, reinterprets Shakespeare's Hamlet from the point of view of the prince's two old school chums, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who become unwittingly involved in, and ultimately victims of, the power play between Hamlet and his stepfather. A screen treatment of Stoppard's 1966 hit tragi comic play by the same name, the film was not generally expected to take the Golden Lion prize despite the favorable reviews it received after its screening.

Venice's prosecutor has asked a judge to ban the film in Venice under Italy's laws on obscenity and blasphemy. The judge has not made a decision.
